the Investigator (Level Requirement: 3rd/4th)</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Okay, this part may seem odd, but for those of you who&rsquo;ve read my Alchemist Guide, there was a section in Archetypes that stated there was a level requirement to get the most out of the archetype. &nbsp;In the same way, I actually want to say that the Investigator class as a whole has this same hurdle. &nbsp;I personally believe that this class doesn&rsquo;t REALLY take off until you hit 4th level, and in a game that won&rsquo;t have 4th or higher level play, I would actually probably avoid this class. &nbsp;This is just me being critical about the class design, but a lot of the class really takes off then. &nbsp;I could be less critical, and place it at 3rd, since that&rsquo;s your first Investigator talent, but 4th is where things really kick off.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c20">This isn&rsquo;t to say that you can&rsquo;t play and have fun with a lower level investigator, you still get Inspiration and Alchemy at 1st level which the class uses well, but 2nd level is very lackluster, and you only really start to feel like an Investigator at 3rd/4th level. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s sad and I don&rsquo;t like the design of it at all, but for official play, this is what you&rsquo;ll be stuck with, so make your decision on what you&rsquo;ll play based on that. &nbsp;For 1-3 level games, I&rsquo;d stick with an Alchemist,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">since you&rsquo;ll feel more like your concept immediately. &nbsp;This is just a suggestion though, and take it with a grain of salt.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">For those who aren&rsquo;t playing official, I&rsquo;d suggest the following changes to the class:</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><ul class="c33 lst-kix_hejvcusl1dr5-0 start"><li class="c1 c18 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Investigator Talent and Infusion at 1st level</span></li><li class="c1 c18 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Studied Combat at 2nd level</span></li><li class="c1 c18 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Studied Strike at 3rd Level</span></li></ul><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">To me, these changes will greatly enhance low level play for this class, allowing it to more easily fit the niche that it is designed to meet. &nbsp;Overall this is still a very solid and fun class to play, but this is a guide as much to have fun with the class as it is to be good with it, and I feel these changes would improve that enjoyment.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><a id="id.a3i2v5hlo7v5"></a><p

ranged combat (thanks Rogue half), which really limits their roles in combat. &nbsp;But where they lack in ranged combat, they are quite solid in melee, managing to buff their melee potential. &nbsp;You CAN get Ranged Study to make up for that, but I still don&rsquo;t feel without Steel Hound that going ranged is really worth it.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c3">Melee Striker</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Your Investigator can actually do a good bit of damage in melee, and without the assistance of a flank. &nbsp;Studied Combat helps buff your accuracy to the point where you should be good at landing hits, even if you are a bit MAD to do it. &nbsp;Investing in making yourself more accurate is always worth it though, as it makes your big finish of Studied Strike all the more likely to hit, and you should really only be finishing people off with that. &nbsp;The only big decision you need to make with this is if you want to go Strength or Dex based. &nbsp;Extracts help make you a combat MONSTER, which always helps your bottom line, and are generally better for Strength Investigators.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c16 c7 c20">Strength vs. Dexterity</span><span class="c2">: This is a hard call, since either one is a viable choice. &nbsp;Pros of Dex include higher AC, Init, Reflex save, and Str as a dumpstat. &nbsp;Pros of Str include not needing feats/magic items to pull it off, more versatile weapon selection, and better use of extracts, since most transformations focus on boosting Str.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">In the end it&rsquo;s your call, but realize that either one is as viable as the other.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c3">Team Buffer</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">While you need Infusion to do this (boo, hiss), you have the same advantage of the Alchemist, which is giving buffs to your party that normally can&rsquo;t be shared. &nbsp;Use this to your advantage, make sure you pass these awesome buffs off to the party members who need them, and give them a reason to love you. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re a buff machine, you can heal, and you&rsquo;ve got access to Alchemist only extracts like Touch Injection, which also gives you access to some of their cruel tricks (like using Touch Injection with Skinsend). &nbsp;You&rsquo;re the hero of the party without swinging even once, how does it feel?</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c3">Social Butterfly</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">With 6 skill points and social skills already baked into your package, you&rsquo;re able to chat up kings, queens, and everyone else in a position of power. &nbsp;Probably the worst thing about this role is your utter lack of need for Charisma, but with a single trait, Student of Philosophy, you can hobnob with the best of them just due to how smart you are.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c3">Ranged Striker</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">There&rsquo;s a feat tax to this (technically two, with Weapon Focus), but if you&rsquo;re going this, you&rsquo;re doing it Steel Hound, and the two are actually really nice together. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a decent style to pick, but you&rsquo;ll be down some feats from the early game, especially since you can&rsquo;t get Weapon Focus at 1st level (although you could retrain&hellip;)</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c7 c3"><a class="c5"

There&#39;s so much variety and versatility, and they all come with great traits.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Tengu</span><span class="c11 c3">&nbsp;(****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Good racials with some great racial abilities make this a strong choice, and adding weapons to your roster can&rsquo;t hurt, even though a great tengu should be natural attacking.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c13 c3">Tiefling</span><span class="c13 c3">&nbsp;(*****)</span><span class="c2">Perfect racials that are easily swapped, great racial traits to be swapped, and just looking sweet as hell makes this probably one of the best choices you can make, just make sure to get a tail.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c17 c7 c3">Uncommon and Other Races</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">A note here, these aren&rsquo;t exactly &lsquo;normal&rsquo; races, so you might want to make sure you get GM approval before playing anything here, since they may not fit your GM&rsquo;s view of their world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c4">Lashunta</span><span class="c11 c3">&nbsp;(****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Males pick up +2str/int, which is awesome. &nbsp;You also get limited telepathy, which is pretty exclusive, all in all making these ugly fugs some strong investigators.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c13 c3">Lizardfolk</span><span class="c13 c3">&nbsp;(*****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The best non skinwalker strength investigator, 3 natural attacks with +2 natural armor and +2str/con adjustments makes you a melee monster, all others need not apply.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c7">Vanara</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;These primates have decent enough racials, a tail which is always nice, and are quite good at knowledge skills, which should be something you strive to be as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c7">Strix</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A fly speed to start with (and a pretty good one at that) is a huge bonus to start off with, and their racials don&#39;t conflict with anything you want.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Wyvaran</span><span class="c11 c3">&nbsp;(****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The only dragon race of the bunch, this is another flying race with slightly better stat adjustments in place of worse speed and maneuverability. Sadly the tail can&#39;t be used to grab items or else this would be purple, but it can make AOOs at full strength bonus, which is often a pretty solid amount. </span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span

class="c1"><span class="c16 c7 c3">Traits</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Traits for an investigator should be used less for skills and more for neat little abilities, as investigators already have quite a robust skill list. &nbsp;You don&rsquo;t need to expand upon it much, and you&rsquo;d be better off getting minor bonuses to other things as opposed to working on your skill list. &nbsp;Consider things that switch skills for intelligence to get your stats working even harder for you, as well as anything that&rsquo;ll help raise your survivability. &nbsp;Remember that weak fort save of yours, and don&rsquo;t neglect ways to strengthen it in case of a random streak of bad luck.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Also make sure you get your traits approved by your GM, since some of the suggested ones below can be very powerful, and you don&rsquo;t want to upset the balance of your game. &nbsp;As always, remember that you&rsquo;re playing WITH your GM, and not against them.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Since I&rsquo;ve covered traits already for alchemist, rather than rehashing it here, I&rsquo;ll just link to that section, as for the most part, the traits hold equal value to both, aside from bomb ones and such. &nbsp;While some of the information doesn&rsquo;t sync up perfectly (some class skills you&rsquo;ll already have, and you won&rsquo;t have bombs, although you could get a mutagen), the information is pretty close to the same for both of them, as both have a lot of similar focuses, and can be played in very similar ways.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span

traits</a></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Rather in this section, I&rsquo;ll talk about a few traits that I think are especially good for Investigators, since I don&rsquo;t want this to just be a dead section. &nbsp;The category of the trait will be after the name of it.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Accelerated Drinker</span><span class="c11 c3">&nbsp;(****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;(Combat) You like potions just as much as an alchemist, and getting more inside of you will always help you. &nbsp;A lot better once you have Studied Combat down to a swift action though.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Reactionary</span><span class="c11 c3">&nbsp;(****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;(Combat) This is really for ALL initiative boosting traits, going first makes a big difference in a lot of fights, it lets you get in on opponents a lot faster. &nbsp;That can make or break a close encounter.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Pragmatic Activator</span><span class="c11 c3">&nbsp;(****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;(Magic) You&rsquo;ve got Rogue in your blood, and Rogues love tricking magic items. &nbsp;This is a very solid call, and abuses that massive intellect of yours.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Adopted</span><span class="c11 c3">&nbsp;(****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;(Social) Being adopted is great, you get whatever racial trait you want, and racial traits can be pretty impressive. &nbsp;Consider being dropped off on a doorstep for your next character.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Bruising Intellect</span><span class="c11 c3">&nbsp;(****)</span><span class="c7 c20">&nbsp;(Soc</span><span>ial) </span><span class="c2">If you want to be a bully and scare people, this will be what you use to do it, as it makes your smarts scare people, which it probably already should.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Student of Philosophy</span><span class="c11 c3">&nbsp;(****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;(Social) This is GOLD for you, basing two charisma skills off of intelligence. &nbsp;While there&rsquo;s some minor limitations in its use, it&rsquo;s perfect for making you a social butterfly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Tusked</span><span class="c11 c3">&nbsp;(****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;(Racial-Orc) A bite attack is really nice for you since you&rsquo;ll be in melee anyways, it&rsquo;s basically a free attack whenever you want it, so feel free to give people a little nibble.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c13 c3">Second Chance</span><span class="c13 c3">&nbsp;(*****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;(Religion) Probably THE best trait in the game, easily worth picking up for anyone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c13 c3">Defensive Strategist</span><span class="c13 c3">&nbsp;(*****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;(Religion) Basically Uncanny Dodge in a trait, and great for slower Investigators who might not be winning initiative all the time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Fashionable</span><span class="c11 c3">&nbsp;(****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;(Faction) This is a plus to 3 different social skills, and making one of them a class skill. &nbsp;As long as you&rsquo;re dressed to the nines, you&rsquo;ll be getting a great buff to your skill set.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Sword Scion</span><span class="c11 c3">&nbsp;(****)</span><span class="c7 c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">(Campaign) Picking up a free longsword is nice, but the +1 to attack rolls permanently is what makes this worth looking at, since accuracy is the name of the game, and longswords are a good weapon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c13 c3">Finding Haleen</span><span class="c13 c3">&nbsp;(*****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;(Campaign) If your GM says this trait is banned, don&rsquo;t argue. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s too good, and you shouldn&rsquo;t need one this hype. &nbsp;+1 HP and skill point a level on top of favored class is just too good.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c7 c3"><a class="c5" href="#id.jf7rp62bnfq0">Return to Table of Contents</a></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span

it&rsquo;s also here where you&rsquo;re looking at what to trade out for other features. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m not in love with a lot of Investigator archetypes, but I&rsquo;ll do my best to rate everything as fairly as I can. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c13 c3">Alchemy</span><span class="c13 c3">&nbsp;(*****)</span><span class="c7 c20">&nbsp;THIS IS SO GOOD, NEVER GET RID OF THIS EVER! &nbsp;Holy god, this is the best thing about you, by far. &nbsp;Extracts are amazing, they are so versatile and give you so much additional power and utility that you&rsquo;d have to have a GREAT reason to want to get rid of this class feature. &nbsp;All archetypes that get rid of this are </span><span class="c7 c3 c14">RED</span><span class="c7 c20">&nbsp;by default due to how amazing this is (except </span><span>one</span><span class="c2">.) &nbsp;Seriously, never underestimate extracts. &nbsp;The other benefit of making alchemical items faster is nice too, especially if you&rsquo;re a Hybrid Funnel junkie like myself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Inspiration</span><span class="c11 c3">&nbsp;(****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Barely blue, but this is the kind of ability that you&rsquo;ll be using your Talents to buff, as eventually Inspiration can be a deadly tool. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s helpful at first though, mostly to push your near successes to where you need them to be, and is a nice buffer zone, although it&rsquo;s really expensive to use on attacks at first.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c3 c12">Trapfinding</span><span class="c3 c12">&nbsp;(**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is as situational an ability as it&rsquo;s always been, so if you can trade it out, don&rsquo;t feel bad about it, since it&rsquo;s really just a trait away, and some games you won&rsquo;t even notice it&rsquo;s gone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c14 c3">Poison Lore</span><span class="c14 c3">&nbsp;(*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s better than Use Poison, but that was a low bar in the first place. &nbsp;This is prime trade bait for archetypes, so don&rsquo;t hesitate to get rid of it if you have the chance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c14 c3">Poison Resistance</span><span class="c14 c3">&nbsp;(*)</span><span class="c7 c14 c20">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Again, an easy trade out due to how little this matters, although your low fort save is more of an issue, so it at least has a little more use if you decide to keep it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Investigator Talents</span><span class="c11 c3">&nbsp;(****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You will need these, and since you&rsquo;re not taking ranged styles (which eats feats), a lot of your feats should be based on getting more of these. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s really no reason why not to stock up on them, since they help make your inspiration better, as well as make you better at your job. &nbsp;Probably your second best class feature behind Alchemy, and helps make Inspiration into a terrifying thing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c3 c12">Keen Recollection</span><span class="c3 c12">&nbsp;(**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is okay during the early game, but by about 4th/5th level, it really drops off, as knowledge DCs are getting more competitive, and you can&rsquo;t get buy on just a lucky roll.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c14 c3">Trap Sense</span><span class="c14 c3">&nbsp;(*)</span><span class="c7 c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">It shouldn&rsquo;t be hard to find and disable traps, miniscule bonuses to avoiding them don&rsquo;t help.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Studied Combat</span><span class="c11 c3">&nbsp;(****)</span><span class="c7 c20">&nbsp;Studied Combat is what an Investigator uses to get around their 3/4ths BAB. &nbsp;The boost to accuracy and damage is very nice though, and considering a 16 int, which isn&rsquo;t at all uncommon, it will last for 3 rounds, more than enough for most combats. &nbsp;While it&rsquo;s still a little on the weak side for a combat buff, it does let you end it with a bang. &nbsp;A little sad that it doesn&rsquo;t work twice in a day against the same target without burning </span><span>I</span><span class="c7 c20">nspiration, but</span><span>&nbsp;it&rsquo;s still a solid boost to accuracy and damage</span><span class="c2">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c3 c12">Studied Strike</span><span class="c3 c12">&nbsp;(**)</span><span class="c7 c20">&nbsp;This...could be better. &nbsp;It only works on one attack, the damage is pretty low for most of the game, and it ends Studied Combat, which by numbers, will end up adding WAY more damage with both the damage buff and accuracy increase. &nbsp;Sure it&rsquo;s good on the last attack of your Studied Combat, but it&rsquo;s just not great on it&rsquo;s own, really serving as more of a parting gift of your awesome accuracy. &nbsp;It does get better with talents, but most of the talents are really late game, too late for most of us to </span><span>get a lot of use from them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c3 c12">Swift Alchemy</span><span class="c3 c12">&nbsp;(**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The item creation speed buff is really what I like here, as poison is not great to put on weapons anyways. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s far better ways to poison than with a weapon, so enjoy your fast tanglefoot bags.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c3 c12">Poison Immunity</span><span class="c3 c12">&nbsp;(**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;More useful than a flat bonus, and serves you decently as a defense against something you&rsquo;re pretty weak to, so while it won&rsquo;t come up often, it&rsquo;s nice enough to have in your back pocket.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c7">True Inspiration</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a capstone, it&rsquo;s not great, but if you&rsquo;re here, you&rsquo;re making 6th level extracts and tearing open reality, so you&rsquo;re not really too occupied with being a skill monster. &nbsp;Still, if you were in love with skills before this, you&rsquo;ll be incredible at them now.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><a id="id.40dynssbxx4g"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c16 c7 c3">Skills</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c20">You&rsquo;re a skill monkey, this is something you do well, and with Inspiration, you should be able to accomplish a lot if you set your mind to it. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s good to make a solid use of your skills when you can, since there&rsquo;s quite a few that are better in your hands than anyone </span><span>else&#39;s</span><span class="c2">. &nbsp;With 6 skill points a level with an intelligence focused class, you&rsquo;re hard pressed to find yourself lacking for skill points, making you better at skills than basically any other class, especially with the ways you can inspire yourself to use them better.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c7">Acrobatics</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This can help with your mobility early game, although drops off in use unless you work at it, especially dex investigators.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c3 c12">Appraise</span><span class="c3 c12">&nbsp;(**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;It has its use, but magic is generally better at this. &nbsp;Nice for not needing a spell though.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c7">Bluff</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;I do like this, but Diplomacy is still king here, since telling the truth is often better than lying, and has longer lasting consequences. &nbsp;Bluff is good in a pinch though, just don&rsquo;t make it your default.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c14 c3">Climb</span><span class="c14 c3">&nbsp;(*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Yeah, you&rsquo;ll be flying soon enough, leave this one behind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c7">Craft</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Craft Alchemy is a goldmine for you, and lets you make plenty of fun toys that will stay relevant for far longer than you&rsquo;d think. &nbsp;Make sure to invest in this, as Alchemy actually adds to this as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Diplomacy</span><span class="c11 c3">&nbsp;(****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The default social skill. &nbsp;Try to use this instead of bluff whenever you can, as it&rsquo;s very hard to be &lsquo;caught in the truth&rsquo; as opposed to caught in a lie.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c7">Disable Device</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You&rsquo;re part Rogue, you should act like it, and this can be used for a few different things, making it a decently versatile skill.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c3 c12">Disguise</span><span class="c3 c12">&nbsp;(**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You have magic, so this isn&rsquo;t that vital, although even magic doesn&#39;t give you a perfect disguise. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c3 c12">Escape Artist</span><span class="c3 c12">&nbsp;(**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A decent &lsquo;just in case&rsquo; skill, this is tertiary in your skill concerns.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c3 c12">Heal</span><span class="c3 c12">&nbsp;(**)</span><span class="c7 c20">&nbsp;Y</span><span>ou&rsquo;ll need this to actually investigate bodies and do forensics and such, and the other uses of it can be okay in a low magic game where you don&rsquo;t have access to ways to heal poisons early.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c7">Intimidate</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;I personally like this in combat more than out of it, since you can scare someone into a debuff which isn&rsquo;t too hard. &nbsp;Out of combat, it&rsquo;s just a way to make enemies.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">Knowledge (ALL)</span><span class="c11 c3">&nbsp;(****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;All knowledge skills is really nice, since it lets you tailor yourself to how you want the game to run. &nbsp;It gives you a chance to always know what&rsquo;s up, especially if your GM lets you know how things are going to go setting wise. &nbsp;You could easily pick up two of these with how many skills points you have.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c3 c12">Linguistics</span><span class="c3 c12">&nbsp;(**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Another rainy day skills, but not one you&rsquo;ll need often enough to pump. &nbsp;You could probably just use magic for the same effect with no real problems.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c13 c3">Perception</span><span class="c3 c13">&nbsp;(*****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Most important skill in the game, max it all the time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c14 c3">Perform</span><span class="c14 c3">&nbsp;(*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While I&rsquo;m a big fan of it, most of you won&rsquo;t want to play for change, and you&rsquo;ve got other skills that are far better at making you money than this. &nbsp;Solely a &lsquo;fun&rsquo; skill</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c14 c3">Profession</span><span class="c14 c3">&nbsp;(*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;See above.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c7">Sense Motive</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;As a social character, you want to be aware of when you&rsquo;re being lied to, which makes this beauty far more important. &nbsp;Keep it maxed if you plan on being the party face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c3 c12">Sleight of Hand</span><span class="c3 c12">&nbsp;(**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While a cool skill, this one is far more likely to get you into trouble than most other skills, making it a risk. &nbsp;But it is fun as hell, which makes it worth it for that reason alone. &nbsp;This skill really depends on the kind of character that you want to build, so choose wisely when to use it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c7">Spellcraft</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This skill will rarely be useless, nice for inscribing things into your formulae book as well as identifying spells and potions, always a strong pick.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c7">Stealth</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You&rsquo;re good at being sneaky, this will make you great at it. &nbsp;Better for small characters, but anyone can benefit from it easily as long as you&rsquo;re not too large.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c13 c3">Use Magic Device</span><span class="c13 c3">&nbsp;(*****)</span><span class="c7 c13 c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">There&rsquo;s a lot of fun in pretending to be a mage, and tricking magic items into thinking you&rsquo;re one is aces. &nbsp;This gives you access to all sorts of fun toys, and toys should be a large amount of what you do.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">All in all, you are a skill hero, and it&rsquo;s important to make use of your skills to the best of your ability. &nbsp;Make sure to discuss with your party and GM which skills you&rsquo;ll need and which ones you can skip out on to avoid stepping on anyone else&rsquo;s toes. &nbsp;You have the ability to make pretty much any kind of skill focused character you want, so feel free to branch out a bit and try out different things, really explore your character&rsquo;s limits.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span

class="c2">This is where we&rsquo;re hitting stride for what makes your Ace Investigator really work. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re now starting to feel like a real investigator, and you&rsquo;re even ready for your own cravat! &nbsp;All investigators have one, and you&rsquo;re not a real investigator until you get one. &nbsp;A lot of your talents will help make you better at what you want to focus in, whether it be social, perception, or combat. &nbsp;Make sure you take care, since you really don&rsquo;t get enough talents to do more than one or two things at most, especially early game.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Some talents are restricted to certain levels, and if there is such a restriction, it will be placed in front of the talent in question. &nbsp;Any talent that requires you to have another talent will also be placed next to the prerequisite to make it easier to find.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span

Talents</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Note</span><span class="c2">: You can only apply one &lsquo;strike&rsquo; talent to any Studied Strike at a time. &nbsp;The DC for all &lsquo;strike&rsquo; talents is 10+int mod+&frac12; Investigator level.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">17th </span><span class="c3 c12">Blinding Strike (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Man, this would be SO much better earlier and without this short a duration. &nbsp;By 17th level, things have true sight and blindsight and all sorts of other nice ways to see you without using their eyes. &nbsp;This is such a too little, too late effect. &nbsp;Although it could be useful if you&rsquo;re in a heavily human based game.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">19th </span><span class="c0">Confusing Strike (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Another needlessly late talent, but it has an effect on a passed save which is nice, but it&rsquo;s not entirely likely that you&rsquo;ll be facing opponents who are vulnerable to confusion by 19th level, making this a pretty iffy addition to your strike team.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">5th </span><span class="c0">Domino Effect (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is probably the best &lsquo;strike&rsquo; you can get and you can also obtain it very early as well, at least as far as strikes go, as it&rsquo;s a flat damage multiplier against multiple opponents that doesn&rsquo;t require that you burn your strike right away, making for a nice combo effect.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">15th </span><span class="c14 c3">Deafening Strike (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Also needlessly late, and deafening doesn&rsquo;t even hurt a lot. &nbsp;Sure if you get a mage with it, it&rsquo;ll kinda mess up their spellcasting, but if you can actually hit a mage, they&rsquo;re probably dead anyways.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">13th</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c12">Prolonged Study (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;More time for Studied Combat is nice (not sure why this can&rsquo;t be combined with other things), but by this point you&rsquo;ll probably have 18 int, and most combats don&rsquo;t last longer than that, especially with one opponent you need to focus on. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s good if you have drawn out battles, but comes late.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">13th </span><span class="c14 c3">Repositioning Strike (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Oh wow, I get to attempt a combat maneuver no one takes anyways? &nbsp;And no bonus on it, so I&rsquo;m making it with my janky 3/4ths BAB? &nbsp;Good thing I had to wait for 13th level for all this power!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">5th </span><span class="c0">Sapping Offense (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is actually some nice denial right here, stopping the target from making AOOs for a round without blowing your Strike, this is actually worth the time to help other party members make their way into position, a real team ability that lets you keep your Studied Combat bonuses.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">7th </span><span class="c11 c3">Sickening Offensive (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Even one round of sickening is good, and seeing as you can keep landing blows to give them penalties, this is a very solid use of your talent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">13th </span><span class="c14 c3">Stealing Strike (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While cool in theory, you can rob whatever you&rsquo;re fighting after you knock it out/kill it, so you don&rsquo;t need to preemptively steal from it most of the time. &nbsp;For when you do, you&rsquo;ll probably have a more dedicated offensive way to steal instead of blowing your strike for a flat CMB check with your 3/4ths BAB.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">7th </span><span class="c14 c3">Slowing Strike (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While I want to like this more, the slowdown isn&rsquo;t enough, and you&rsquo;d probably want to slow them with your first hit for it to really matter, which means you&rsquo;re no longer getting your Studied Combat bonuses to attack and damage. &nbsp;All that for a chance of slowing someone isn&rsquo;t the best use of your time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">3rd </span><span class="c3 c12">Timed Strike (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While not bad, the amount of damage this adds will probably only be 2-4, which for the potential of your strikes is actually pretty low. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s okay, but just not up to par with other options.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">9th </span><span class="c3 c12">Toppling Strike (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This barely scores higher, since tripping is great to do, but it suffers from the same problem as most of the other &lsquo;strike&rsquo; talents, in that it makes you want to strike early when you should be saving it for a last hit to get the most from your Studied Combat bonuses.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><a id="id.3sln5029pbw5"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c17 c7 c3">Alchemist Discoveries</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Note</span><span class="c2">: Alchemist discoveries are listed at the lowest possible level you can obtain them, and while you can&rsquo;t gain feats at 6th/12th/16th level, you can retrain feats if your GM has allowed that option in your game, allowing you to gain these talents earlier than you normally would.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">3rd </span><span class="c14 c3">Combine Extracts (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Not really a great choice, as an Admixture Vial can do this for only 5k, which is a steal for being able to buy a talent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">3rd </span><span class="c3 c12">Concentrate Poison (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This could be higher, except you have the golden standard of making poison work, which makes this discovery redundant unless you&rsquo;re not hitting 7th level.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">12th </span><span class="c0">Dilution (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is better for Alchemist who can make their own potions, but isn&rsquo;t bad for you, as it does give you some more magic for less gold. &nbsp;Pretty solid for potion junkies though.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">16th </span><span class="c0">Elixir of Life (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is slightly better for you instead of Alchemist, as you don&rsquo;t get Philosopher&#39;s Stone to make infinite money. &nbsp;While I think getting Determination on your armor/shield is a better call, this is still an (expensive) 1-up in a bottle, and should be treated as such.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">3rd </span><span class="c0">Enhance Potion (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is pretty nice for low level potions that get better with higher CLs, which there are a few that you can pick up. &nbsp;Nothing too great, but another potion junkie special.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">3rd </span><span class="c3 c12">Extend Potion (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is kinda weak by itself, although not terrible. &nbsp;But as for with the Alchemist, you&rsquo;re really only picking this up so you can eventually get&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">16th </span><span class="c13 c3">Eternal Potion (*****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s as good as it sounds, get it ASAP, it&rsquo;s perfect and amazing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">3rd </span><span class="c11 c3">Infusion (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is a talent tax, plain and simple. &nbsp;There is no reason these shouldn&rsquo;t be useable with your party already, this is just a needless hurdle to eat up your resources. &nbsp;Although it&rsquo;s incredible and you want it right now, no doubt. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll NEED it to be a team player as well as to pull of some nice tricks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">3rd </span><span class="c11 c3">Mutagen (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;I honestly think it&rsquo;s unfair you can get both this AND Studied Combat at the same time, and if there wasn&rsquo;t SO many things fighting for your first talent (and second if you&rsquo;re using a feat), this would be the instant go to. &nbsp;A stat buff, an AC buff, and a long duration for a renewable resource is just incredible.</span></p><p

myself to rate these, they&rsquo;re all terrible. &nbsp;This section is specifically dedicated to telling you to avoid them at all cost. &nbsp;You could take just about anything else, and it&rsquo;d be better than these garbage talents. &nbsp;While we&rsquo;re here, if you haven&rsquo;t already, check out Phoenix Wright, it&rsquo;s a really fun game with a great cast of characters, and it&rsquo;s a long running series, giving you a chance to really bond with them. &nbsp;Even give Apollo Justice a try, it&rsquo;s just as fun as the others, and Apollo is a fine lead character.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><a id="id.b3hlzc7wgpen"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Other Talents</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">7th </span><span class="c0">Amazing Inspiration (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You like Inspiration, and this makes it better. &nbsp;Anything that buffs your odds of succeeding, especially when it&rsquo;s dire enough to need Inspiration, is worth it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">3rd </span><span class="c3 c12">Applied Engineering (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While it&rsquo;s fun in concept, I can&rsquo;t see this being useful too often, making it just sort of an interesting talent without much use, especially with it requiring Inspiration to work.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">9th </span><span class="c0">Combat Inspiration (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;I seriously feel like this comes too late, but it&rsquo;s solid if you&rsquo;re using Inspiration in combat a lot, which is a good place to use it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">19th </span><span class="c11 c3">Combat Inspiration, Greater (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This feels like a capstone, and actually combos really well with your capstone, making this an easy choice for your last talent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">3rd </span><span class="c0">Device Talent</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;For UMD junkies, this is awesome, since it gives you free Inspiration on all UMD checks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">3rd </span><span class="c3 c12">Effortless Aid (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Aiding isn&rsquo;t really great, but it&rsquo;s nice if you have nothing else to do with your turn, and making it a swift action basically trades a point of Inspiration for a +2 to a friend.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">9th </span><span class="c0">Eidetic Recollection (***)</span><span>&nbsp;Another that&rsquo;s late, knowledge checks are important to pass, and this gets better the more knowledges you took. &nbsp;Plus a natural 20 on an important knowledge check is worth Inspiration.</span><span class="c17 c7 c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">5th </span><span class="c0">Empathy (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is a nice social talent, and while I don&rsquo;t like the mind reading being &lsquo;once a day&rsquo;, the rest of it is good enough to the point where if you want to be good at reading people, this is the way to do it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">3rd </span><span class="c3 c11">Expanded Inspiration (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A perfect gift to you social investigators, this will help make sure you&rsquo;re not getting tricked as well as another cap in the feather of diplomacy over bluff.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">11th </span><span class="c14 c3">Hidden Agenda (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;On the lacking side of social investigators, how often are you passing secret messages in a game? &nbsp;The divination defense is nice, but it doesn&rsquo;t save this talent at all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">7th </span><span class="c3 c12">Inspirational Expertise (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A +4 bonus is nice, but eating Inspiration as well as a swift action can be a steep price, so weigh your options with this one. &nbsp;I myself think it&rsquo;s too costly for the benefit for only 1 round.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">3rd </span><span class="c3 c12">Inspired Alertness (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is slightly better for strength investigators, as they&rsquo;re more likely to be taken by surprise, but I feel like your Inspiration has better places to be spent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">3rd </span><span class="c0">Inspired Intimidator (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Here&rsquo;s a way to actually help debuff an opponent and keep them debuffed for the rest of the fight. &nbsp;Late game this trails off in value, but for the first 8 levels or so, it&rsquo;s a great fear effect.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">7th </span><span class="c14 c3">Item Lore (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;By 7th level, you should have other ways of determining things like this, so skip out on this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">3rd Perceptive Tracking (?)</span><span>&nbsp;Tracking is not a good niche to have. &nbsp;To get meta, you&rsquo;re either going to follow tracks, or you can&rsquo;t, so this doesn&rsquo;t really have a rating unless your GM actually follows the tracking rules. &nbsp;I have never had one who did, so at best, it&rsquo;d be </span><span class="c3 c12">ORANGE (**)</span><span class="c2">. Tracking is a plot device, plain and simple.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">5th</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c13 c3">Quick Study (*****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This IS your 5th level talent. &nbsp;How this didn&rsquo;t get its level requirement lifted sky high is beyond me, but this allows you to actually move and attack while using Studied Combat, and that&rsquo;s really what you want to do, especially if you&rsquo;re going first. &nbsp;Maybe worse for strength investigators, but even they can enjoy this for when they do go first. &nbsp;Either way, dropping the action of Studied Combat down to a swift action is the best thing you can do with your talents.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">9th </span><span class="c14 c3">Studied Defense (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Ehhh...if this dropped the damage, it&rsquo;d be okay, but losing your accuracy bonus hurts, and it hurts bad. &nbsp;Accuracy is the name of the game for you, don&rsquo;t drop it for a +3/4/5 to your AC.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">13th </span><span class="c11 c3">Tenacious Inspiration (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Another great way to buff your Inspiration, there&rsquo;s really no downside to always having a better chance of succeeding, consider this when you&rsquo;re high enough level to take it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">17th </span><span class="c14 c3">Unconventional Inspiration (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Very late to the party, and by this time, I can&rsquo;t think of a skill that you can&rsquo;t already use Inspiration with that you&rsquo;d still want to. &nbsp;Maybe if it were ALL skills, but one just isn&rsquo;t cutting it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">3rd </span><span class="c0">Underworld Inspiration (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The flip side of Expanded Inspiration, this will make you the toast of the criminal underworld, and you can get it pretty early too, making it a great way to help out you dastards.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c7 c3"><a class="c5" href="#id.jf7rp62bnfq0">Return to Table of Content</a></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><a id="id.e1qchpvqrsja"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c16 c27 c7 c6 c3">6.

investigators. &nbsp;While they&rsquo;re busy with things that seem cool, you&rsquo;ll be picking the options you know are great. &nbsp;Make sure you play to your strengths, as it&rsquo;s very easy to spread yourself too thin in options. &nbsp;Honestly since ranged combat isn&rsquo;t much of an option for you without its own feat sink, it frees up feats you could have been using for those to have a bit more fun in melee, and honestly I&rsquo;d suggest you stick to melee instead of WF/Ranged Study. &nbsp;You don&rsquo;t have the feats needed to take both of those feats AND everything else you&rsquo;d need to work at a range, at least not without a fighter dip.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c7 c20"><a class="c5"

id="id.rszrl3c5gfzv"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Core Rulebook</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c14 c3">Skill Boosting Feats (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;As I&rsquo;ve said before, feats that boost skills aren&rsquo;t your game. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re good enough at skills without these feats, and in a lot of situations, they&rsquo;re overkill. &nbsp;Stick to feats that gives you new abilities or upgrade your old ones, those are the ones that are going to help make you super hype.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c14 c3">Agile Maneuvers (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Unless you&rsquo;re super buffing yourself, combat maneuvers aren&rsquo;t for you, and most great buffs help strength, so this feat doesn&rsquo;t really help that much for CMBs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c14 c3">Combat Expertise (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is a feat tax, plain and simple. &nbsp;You don&rsquo;t have the attack bonus to spare to use this, and even if you did, you have better uses of a feat. &nbsp;Only for gateways to better feats.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c14 c3">Combat Maneuvers (*)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span>(</span><span class="c3 c12">Trip (**)</span><span class="c3">, </span><span class="c14 c3">Grab</span><span class="c3">, </span><span class="c14 c3">Disarm</span><span class="c3">, </span><span class="c14 c3">Bullrush</span><span class="c3">, </span><span class="c14 c3">Etc (*)</span><span class="c2">) You aren&rsquo;t great at these, and only strength Investigators have a chance of making these good. &nbsp;Trip and Dirty Trick are the only ones that are even worth considering, and even those aren&rsquo;t incredible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Combat Reflexes (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;For a class with access to both Enlarge Person and Longarm, you can really do a lot of damage with AOOs, making this a solid choice if you&rsquo;re looking for a battlefield controller.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c12">Deadly Aim (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While a staple for ranged characters, with how many feats it takes to make ranged work, you&rsquo;re going to need to plan this into your build, and there&rsquo;s feats you need more than this to really work.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Defensive Combat Training (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Most of you investigators are going to be in melee, making this actually something worth considering, since some combat maneuvers can wreck you up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c14 c3">Dodge, Mobility, Spring Attack (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Sorry, but these aren&rsquo;t worth the investment. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re somewhat feat starved as it is, and these don&rsquo;t help your mobility enough to be worth a 3 feat chain for one attack.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c12">Endurance</span><span class="c3">, </span><span class="c3 c12">Diehard (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Not great in and of themselves, these feats lead to some nice places, making them decent to consider, and Diehard isn&rsquo;t bad by itself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Exotic/Martial Weapon Proficiency (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;There&rsquo;s two exotic weapons worth looking at here; fauchard for reach monsters and dueling sword for two weapon fighters, both are quite good for what they give.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Great Fortitude (***)</span><span class="c3">, </span><span class="c3 c12">Improved (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You do have a weak fort save, and while I&rsquo;m not big on using feats to patch saves, you could easily do worse. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d skip over improved though, it feels like overkill to me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Improved Critical (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;For rapier/scimitar/fauchard users, this could add quite a bit of damage. &nbsp;Anyone else can probably skip over it, since it&rsquo;s a hard call between this and keen on a weapon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c14 c3">Improved Feign (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Feigning isn&rsquo;t a strategy you need, or are really that good at. &nbsp;Leave that to rogues.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Improved Initiative (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;For dex investigators, this plus a trait could have you at +9 or higher for your initiative, which would be hard to beat. &nbsp;A must for speed demons.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Improved Unarmed Strike (***)</span><span>&nbsp;This is a solid call for strength investigators, as there&rsquo;s a few style feats that are worth taking, but if you&rsquo;re going this route, just go </span><span class="c11 c3">MOMS (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;for two levels instead of taking this feat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c12">Deflect (**)</span><span class="c3">, </span><span class="c14 c3">Snatch Arrows (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Avoiding a ranged attack can be nice, and it&rsquo;s decent early. &nbsp;But it doesn&rsquo;t hold up well when things are attacking multiple times around, and most stuff is magic or melee.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Leadership (?)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Same rules apply; take if if you can, don&rsquo;t if you can&rsquo;t.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c14 c3">Mounted Feats (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Without a solid way to get a mount that levels with you or a lance, these can be stabled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Point Blank Shot (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The damage and accuracy bonus is small, but considering you&rsquo;ll probably be using guns, it won&rsquo;t matter much since you&rsquo;ll always get it. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s also a prereq for most other ranged feats.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c3">Precise Shot (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Again, going ranged is hard, but you NEED this to do it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c3">Rapid Shot (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Bonus attacks are ALWAYS good. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re rolling in feats, take this when you can.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c3">Power Attack (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;For those with both a mutagen and Studied Combat, you can burn some accuracy to make this viable, as well as your tons of buff extracts. &nbsp;A solid boost to damage all around.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Cleave (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Again, a great weapon for range abusers, but it&rsquo;s worth retraining later in your career.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c12">Quick Draw (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;I almost consider this more of a style feat, but some GMs are strict, so it&rsquo;s not worthless.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c12">Rapid Reload (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is a feat tax for guns to make them work, and since you&rsquo;ll probably be using a gun, you&rsquo;ll need this. &nbsp;The amount of feats to make guns work is staggering though, so remember that in your builds.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Step Up (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Only for range monsters, this can help keep you nice and close, and since the power attack line doesn&rsquo;t really need a lot of feats, you&rsquo;re clear to take this one easily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c12">Toughness (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;I&rsquo;m not a big fan, but you&rsquo;re pretty easy to hurt, so it&rsquo;s a nice buffer if you need it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c3">Two Weapon Fighting (****)</span><span class="c3">, </span><span class="c0">Improved (***)</span><span class="c3">, </span><span class="c3 c12">Greater (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;With both mutagen and Studied Combat, you can REALLY be a blender. &nbsp;This works best with Slashing Grace (dueling sword/sword cane), although that will take you quite a few feats and a -4 to hit to pull off, so a dip in fighter or starting as a human/half elf is advised.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c12">Double Slice (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This sadly isn&rsquo;t a great buff, as it&rsquo;ll be adding 1-3 damage on your off hand, which isn&rsquo;t great. &nbsp;It does lead into a pretty nice feat though&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Two Weapon Rend (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You&rsquo;ll get this late, but it&rsquo;s almost free damage. &nbsp;Scores much lower if your GM won&rsquo;t allow it to do 1 &frac12; dex damage instead of 1 &frac12; strength damage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c14 c3">Vital Strike (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Unless you&rsquo;re a reach monster (and you&rsquo;d be better off with cleave), this is too weak to help. &nbsp;You do your best damage on multiple hits and static damage, not weapon damage dice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c3">Weapon Finesse (*****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is the gateway to the dex investigator, and helps with so much. &nbsp;If you plan on going dex over strength, this is how you get started being a monster.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Weapon Focus (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t like this in and of itself, as it&rsquo;s a small bonus, but it&rsquo;s bonus accuracy, and the first step on a lot of feat chains you like (Slashing Grace, Ranged Study), so you&rsquo;ll probably need it at some point.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c12">Dazzling Display, Shatter Defenses, etc (**) </span><span class="c2">You don&rsquo;t need opponents flat footed like a rogue would, so you don&rsquo;t need to go out of your way to do this. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s nice, but not vital at all.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><a id="id.sggkdtf2zu5"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c17 c7 c3">Advanced Player&rsquo;s Guide</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Additional Traits (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Traits can be better than feats, so if you have a feat laying around, check some out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c12">Combat Patrol (**)</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">You&rsquo;ve already got a fine reach, you don&rsquo;t need to expand it further.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c12">Dazing Assault (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is better for people with a full BAB who can make the save brutal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c12">Eldritch Claws (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;For those of you going natural attacks, these are okay at low level, but a good AMOF should be covering your DR needs in the future.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c12">Following Step (**)</span><span class="c3">, </span><span class="c0">Step up and Strike (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The first feat here is disappointing, as you&rsquo;ll rarely need to move just 10 feet, but the second is nice, as more attacks is always good for you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c14 c3">Furious Focus (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This only works on a vital strike/pummeling style character, and you&rsquo;re probably neither.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c12">Gang up (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You don&rsquo;t really need to flank, so it&rsquo;s only helpful if someone else does.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c3">Heroic Defiance (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;As stated before, holding off a brutal condition for a round, especially with your toolbox of cures for such ills, can keep you in the game. &nbsp;Even once a day, this is a solid option.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c14 c3">Improved Stonecutting (*)</span><span class="c3">, </span><span class="c0">Stone Sense</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The first feat is fugly for days, but getting blindsense can be worth a bad feat, and dwarves aren&rsquo;t terrible investigators. &nbsp;Loses some points at later levels though.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Keen Scent (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Scent is almost always good, since people rarely think to defend against it, and it helps make invisible opponents far less intimidating at early levels.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shadow Strike (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Not being able to get a Studied Strike due to concealment isn&rsquo;t great, but you don&rsquo;t need to go out of your way like a rogue does to get it, since Studied Strike isn&rsquo;t prime on your list of abilities. &nbsp;Mostly for non darkvision folks, but also works for ranged characters as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c3">Steel Soul</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is a prime dwarf feat, as most saves are going to be made against magic.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><a id="id.jmnmfd20eljk"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Ultimate Magic</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c3">Eldritch Heritage (****)</span><span class="c3">, </span><span class="c0">Improved</span><span class="c3">, </span><span class="c0">Greater (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is important for one reason, and one reason alone: getting a familiar. &nbsp;Assuming the rules for an investigator&rsquo;s familiar&rsquo;s work the same as an alchemist&rsquo;s tumor familiar, this is an incredible investment. &nbsp;While the charisma requirement is high, if you have the feats and charisma to do it, getting a familiar amazing. &nbsp;Other feats in the line are fine, but not nearly as important.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><a id="id.mgq39tdg88yp"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Ultimate Combat</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Cleaving Finish</span><span class="c3">, </span><span class="c0">Improved (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;For a range monster, you can use this pretty well, since you can basically attack the entire battlefield. &nbsp;Improved is just as nice, but only really works for a minion slayer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c3">Clustered Shots (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re going ranged, you&rsquo;re taking this. &nbsp;Slightly lower because of how difficult ranged combat is for you to pull off.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Death from Above (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s not hard for you to get flight, although without pounce, this loses some points.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Deathless Initiate (***)</span><span class="c3">, </span><span class="c3 c12">Master (**)</span><span class="c3">, </span><span class="c0">Zealot (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Initiate is the best one here, as getting rid of staggered helps keep you active and fighting. &nbsp;Master is kind of weak, but Zealot can be a life saver if you&rsquo;re a crit magnet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Felling Smash</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While it has some steep prereqs, for a range monster who&rsquo;s probably only making one big attack, this is yet another way to keep the battlefield under control.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c3">Fortified Armor Training (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Carry around a masterwork buckler, and you can negate a crit easy. &nbsp;They&rsquo;re eventually cheap enough to the point where you can carry a few around.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hammer the Gap (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;For those of you turning into monsters with multiple attacks, this is a solid way to make sure they all hit, as well as trash the opponent for tons of extra damage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c3">Snap Shot,</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c11 c3">Improved (****),</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c14 c3">Greater (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Another great ranged feat that you can hopefully get quick, since it&rsquo;s nice to not need to worry about provoking. &nbsp;Improved is a good addition, but greater is not.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c3">Stalwart, Improved (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;I like both of these, and DR/- is the best DR you can get. &nbsp;For a melee monster, they&rsquo;re very nice, and actually give a use to Combat Expertise.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><a

class="c2">&nbsp;Getting back extracts is really nice, and while this is a steep cost to do it, it can be worth it when you really need one. &nbsp;The time restrictions and such do knock this down somewhat though.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c12">Inspired Strike (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This really doesn&rsquo;t do a whole lot of bonus damage (6-8 tops), and inspiration should be used for accuracy more so than damage, even if it is expensive to do so.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c12">Ranged Study (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You don&rsquo;t have the feats to pull this off, and you still need to be within 30 feet for a strike. &nbsp;Maybe for a Steel Hound, but everyone else can leave this be.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c3">Slashing Grace (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;For non humans, this will take until 5th level to come online, and is a solid validation for a swashbuckler dip. &nbsp;But it&rsquo;s a more &lsquo;official&rsquo; way to get dex to damage instead of strength without needing to dance or wield a scimitar. &nbsp;Scimitars are nice weapons, but you&rsquo;re not proficient in them, so it&rsquo;s a hard call.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><a id="id.56xtbsw6oav9"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c17 c7 c3">Other Sources</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c3">Cornugon Smash (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Easily the best way to demoralize since you should always be power attacking.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dampen Presence (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Avoiding tremorsense and blindsense helps make you into a real ninja here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c3">Fencing Grace (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;For those of you who like rapiers, this is your dex to damage feat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hellcat Stealth (***)</span><span>&nbsp;For those of you who want to sneak, this lets you do it all the time, no problems.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c12">Piranha Strike (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This feat is in such an odd place with the investigator. &nbsp;Its biggest problem is it only works with light melee weapons, and you&rsquo;re most likely going to be wielding a 1 handed melee weapon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c3">Potion Glutton (*****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Swift action drink, that&rsquo;s amazing, you NEED this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Weapon Versatility (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re only using one main weapon, this will help you get through certain DR.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c17 c7 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c7

Esttse, amatuer sleuth and recent pariah of Stonegate Estate</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Extracts are a huge part of your class, and unless you&rsquo;re playing in a game that requires you to lose the Alchemy class feature, you should never give it up. &nbsp;These are among the things that make you better than a rogue, and you should treasure them. &nbsp;They are versatile, powerful, and probably the best class feature you have. &nbsp;They do work a bit differently than magic though, so be sure to check out the primer in my Alchemist guide.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Rather than retreading all of these, most of the information contained in my Alchemist guide is perfectly serviceable for a smart investigator (with MH working for most strength investigators and MB working for ranged/dex investigators), so my reviews of these stand. &nbsp;The reviews as well as the extract primer can be found in the following place:</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c7 c3"><a class="c5" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hChbcEsEfQsR7NkwKlzO-GLYtrOtxlkGHpRQgKKZ5gc/edit%23bookmark%3Dkix.e6s8kx57z08j&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117400471000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1k4iPOMxsaV2I5G5fIWKig">Alchemist Extracts</a></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Instead, I&rsquo;d like to list for each level a few of my favorite extracts, giving you an idea of ones that will always be solid calls for you to use. &nbsp;Think of these as the highlights of extracts, ones I find useful in an all purpose sort of way. &nbsp;By no means is this a complete list of great extracts, but rather, the ones I would make sure to have jotted down in my formulae book if given the chance.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">1st</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c3">Anticipate Peril (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is actually solid for both dex and strength investigators, although I would say it helps strength more, since dex investigators will have quite a high initiative already. &nbsp;Going first means buffing first, and that&rsquo;s the best thing you can do. &nbsp;It also means Studying first, so always make sure that you can start encounters whenever possible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Cure Light Wounds</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This should be in your formulae book eventually, as it&rsquo;s a great extract to simply burn out the rest of your unused extracts, and a good reason why not to prepare all of your extracts at the beginning of the day. &nbsp;Keeping your party alive as well as providing minor healing is something that no party will dislike, and gives you something to do with these slots in the higher levels.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c3">Enlarge (****)</span><span>/</span><span class="c0">Reduce Person (***)</span><span class="c21">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Sitting on opposite sides of the scale, both are very helpful, although enlarging is far more so. &nbsp;Increasing range is important, and even with the AC drop, you&rsquo;re still a formidable opponent, especially with a reach weapon. &nbsp;Being smaller increases AC as well as helps with ranged attacks, although it won&rsquo;t increase your damage too, which is a bit of a shame.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c3">Heightened Awareness (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Perceiving is the name of the game for you, and things that help you do it better make you a better investigator. &nbsp;This is good for either type of investigator, and is a great low level extract to throw on before you need to worry about finding minute details. &nbsp;The initiative bonus is just gravy, and helps ensure that you won&rsquo;t be taken by surprise.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c3">Longarm (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Comboed with Enlarge Person, this basically lets you attack the entire field, and makes sure that you can have most opponents on lockdown. &nbsp;You are at your best when you can strike at anyone, and it makes it easier to pick out whom you need to target when the field is clogged with minions. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s even great for dex investigators, as it&rsquo;s still additional reach for your two weapon fighting to slash others to ribbons.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Monkey Fish (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A very easy way to gain some extra methods of travel without much effort, this is great for when you can&rsquo;t follow an opponent any other way. &nbsp;Early level encounters can be made easier with this, making sure that you don&rsquo;t have to let someone flee just because they&rsquo;re more mobile than you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">True Strike (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp; There&rsquo;s never really a BAD time to have this ready, as we&rsquo;ve all needed that miracle shot to make sure we succeeded. &nbsp;This is another one to always keep in the formulae book just in case, as it never really gets old. &nbsp;The only issue is if it&rsquo;s worth an action for a +20 to hit, but when it is, it REALLY is.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">2nd</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ablative Barrier (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You&rsquo;re not the strongest person in the fight, so taking non lethal instead of lethal is a great help. &nbsp;While it won&rsquo;t keep you up, it will keep you from dying, which means your party doesn&rsquo;t have to race to save you mid battle when they should be trying to kill things. &nbsp;The duration of this is quite good as well, making it a solid defensive choice to keep you alive.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c3">Alchemical Allocation (*****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Slightly less useful for you than Alchemist, this still is AMAZING and needs to be learned ASAP for constant potion abuse. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s so many great potions to rinse and repeat with, and high caster level for these potions is of prime importance. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a one time investment that makes you infinitely better, although since you basically need 2 standard actions to pull this off, long term potions are the best use for this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Alter Self (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is the starter extract for transforming into dangerous things. &nbsp;Some of my faves are trogs or lizardfolk, since claw/claw/bite is a very nice routine for a strength investigator.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c3">Barkskin (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The AC boost from this is surprisingly long, and only gets better with time. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s probably better to pick this up around 7th level, but even before then it&rsquo;s a considerably long term natural AC boost with no drawback. &nbsp;Perfect for both strength and dex investigators who want to avoid getting hit too much.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c3">Bull&rsquo;s Strength (****)</span><span>/</span><span class="c0">Cat&rsquo;s Grace (***)</span><span class="c21">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">While Bull&rsquo;s Strength wins out (since it boost damage) both are fine choices to buff your stats and to hit, which is really important for you. &nbsp;The biggest problem with these is their bonus type, which makes them fall out of common use once you have magical stat boost.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c3">Focused Scrutiny (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Another gem for social investigators as well as a decent combat buff, I like this more outside of battle as a way to really read someone. &nbsp;With your method of ingesting extracts, this makes it perfect for secretly imbibing and lacks any visual indications, also making this a fun trick for gambling too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c3">Invisibility (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The best part about this extract is the duration, which starts at 4 minutes and only gets longer. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s fine as a short in combat buff, but really shines outside of it when you can use this to stealth your way through situations. &nbsp;Use this intelligently, and you may avoid certain battles all together.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lesser Restoration (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Another band aid extract, it&rsquo;s a lot better if no one else in the party can use it, but it&rsquo;s still quite nice even if there are other users, as ability damage can be crippling.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c3">Touch Injection (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is the kind of extract that gets better with creativity, although making an extract deliverable by a touch attack is a nice way to increase your own action economy. &nbsp;Plus it lets you use some &lsquo;helpful&rsquo; extracts on opponents *COUGH*SKINSEND*COUGH* without allowing a save.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">3rd</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c3">Channel Vigor (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While most of the time you will be using this for the Haste effect, the fact that it&rsquo;s flat out better than Haste (for you at least) makes this an easy call for combat extracts, since Haste is amazing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c3">Displacement (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Most of you are going to be in melee, and at this level most people still can&rsquo;t see through illusions like this, giving you a great 50% miss chance. &nbsp;That alone is worth the investment, although the duration means that it&rsquo;s solely a combat extract.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c3">Fly (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Unlike Alchemist, this is your main way to fly, and flying opens up a lot of tactical options for both you and your party. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t skip out on a chance to terrorize the friendly skies, start flying today!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c3">Heroism (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;For those of you with multiple attacks, this is golden. &nbsp;The duration of this is very good too, making it something you can throw on at the start of a dungeon and tank through the entire thing with easily. &nbsp;Nice little save bonuses help finish off a solid buff extract.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c3">Monstrous Physique I (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The variety of forms you can take with this is what makes it so good, especially finding a form with a lot of natural attacks. &nbsp;Gargoyles are a personal favorite of mine, packing flight as well.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">4th</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Air Walk, Communal (***)</span><span class="c21">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Getting the entire party airborne (and for a pretty long duration too) is important, and while it doesn&rsquo;t come with the mobility of Fly, it does have the advantage of not needing to prepare it multiple times, leaving you with more extracts to help out yourself and the party.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c3">Beast Shape II (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The gold of this is now getting to take Pounce, and Pounce is always good. &nbsp;Taking a form with Pounce for a strength investigator is going to make you that much more dangerous, and the versatility of being able to take other animals helps make this a great call.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c3">Echolocation (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Did you know Blindsight is hype? &nbsp;Because it is. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s very, very hype. &nbsp;The duration on this isn&rsquo;t perfect, but it&rsquo;s long enough to make sure you don&rsquo;t get snuck up on in a dungeon, makes sure you can always target opponents, and ignores illusions, making it an incredible discovery extract.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c3">Freedom of Movement (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Not being the most evasive person, this keeps you from ever having to worry about getting trapped in something you don&rsquo;t want to be in. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a great panic button to keep you safe from being eaten, trapped, or really most bad situations you&rsquo;d want to evade.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c3">Invisibility, Greater (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is your in combat invisibility, since it won&rsquo;t be breaking anytime soon from swinging. &nbsp;The duration is very short though, so make sure to make the most of it ASAP.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c3">Monstrous Physique II (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Even more powerful forms are here, and while I can&rsquo;t find one with Pounce, the 4 armed gargoyle is an option, making one mean natural attack with flight.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">5th</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c3">Delayed Consumption (*****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is almost too good, and with the duration, will almost never eat into your daily extracts. &nbsp;Even if it does, it&rsquo;s worth it, as having any 4th or lower level extract (Freedom of Movement) on standby just in case things go sour is the kind of insurance that keeps investigators alive.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c3">Magic Jar (*****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is amazing for wizards, you shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to have it, but since you do, abuse this to the fullest of your power by setting up opponents for some hardcore death.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c3">Overland Flight (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While not as maneuverable in the air as others, the duration of this means you can throw it on at the beginning of the day and fly for the rest of it without any issues.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sending (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While this might be a bit costly, communications between long distances is often vital at this point in the game, and since drinking is a standard action, you can get your message across fast.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Stoneskin, Communal (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;People complain about the cost, but this isn&rsquo;t a huge problem, since handing out DR to just about everything is pretty nice, and it&rsquo;ll make your party love you even more.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">6th</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c3">Beast Form IV (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Magical beast are at your fingertips, and from your adventuring career, you probably know which ones you&rsquo;d like to be, or which ones you&rsquo;d like to let your party be. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re getting strong abilities that you&rsquo;d normally not have access to, and you can pass them out to everyone else as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c3">Giant form I (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Giants are nice, but what&rsquo;s nicer are trolls, especially two headed ones. &nbsp;Regeneration keeps you from dropping too, although once you&rsquo;re a troll, people will know what to hit you with. &nbsp;Comboed with some protection against those elements though, it&rsquo;ll be hard to keep you down.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c3">Heal (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The only in combat healing you should be using, this is incredible for keeping party members on their feet. &nbsp;Add to it the things you can heal with it too, and it&rsquo;s the best healing ability you&rsquo;ll ever have.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c3">True Sight (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Being able to negate all illusion spells is powerful, and the duration is pretty solid on it too, so you won&rsquo;t have to worry about being tricked by anyone throwing around fake stuff.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c3">Twin Form (*****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This not only increases your HP, but it also increases your tactical options by twofold. &nbsp;Being able to switch between either body boost your survivability by leaps and bounds, and it makes you incredibly difficult to pin down, which is basically everything you want.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c7 c3"><a class="c5" href="#id.jf7rp62bnfq0">Return

class="c1"><span class="c2">Sadly investigators aren&rsquo;t blessed with a lot of archetypes, and they also have some real garbage ones too. &nbsp;Note that nothing you give up will EVER be as good as Alchemy, not even close. &nbsp;The versatility of that one class feature (which is not only 2/3rds casting but also through one of the most abusable mediums ever) means that unless it gave you FULL casting, it wouldn&rsquo;t be worth it. &nbsp;Be aware of that when you look through the following section, as each of these archetypes changes both the personality of your character as well as their playstyle.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c16 c7 c3">Archetypes</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4

archetypes. &nbsp;For those of you who enjoy skills, this is how you make sure you&rsquo;re not focusing on 4 different stats. &nbsp;While the limited scope of the diplomacy ability is slightly annoying, everything else is perfect, and you&rsquo;re not losing anything valuable</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">4th </span><span class="c0">Unfailing Logic (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Swift Alchemy is okay, and this isn&rsquo;t that bad either, both are a little specific, so it&rsquo;s basically an even trade until 16th level when you pull ahead.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">20th </span><span class="c0">Master Intellect (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a capstone, it&rsquo;s okay, the normal capstone is okay too, an even trade.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c23 c7 c14 c3">Dread Investigator (*)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">1st </span><span class="c14 c3">Delayed Inspiration (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is never a great thing, especially for a class with as slow a start as this. &nbsp;Really, I&rsquo;m DREADING reviewing the rest of this...PUN!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">1st </span><span class="c3 c12">Embalming Fluids (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While losing poison lore isn&rsquo;t even a problem, this still doesn&rsquo;t even out the criminally late start for inspiration that you&rsquo;re taking, not even close.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">2nd </span><span class="c3 c12">Negative Energy Resistance (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Another even trade here, being able to create undead is nice, but still completely unable to get over delayed inspiration.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">7th </span><span class="c3 c12">Reanimation Fluid (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Again, it&rsquo;s neat, but this archetype really only works at 7th level or higher, which made the already quite annoying issue of the investigator&rsquo;s slow start into an almost inescapable trap. &nbsp;Seriously, just go reanimator alchemist if you want to mess around with undead. &nbsp;It loses bomb progression, but not nearly badly enough to make it worse than this hot mess. &nbsp;Raise this up by a color and a half for games that start at 7th level, but for everyone else, losing inspiration for over &frac14; of the game will never make you happy.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Infiltrator (***)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">1st </span><span class="c0">Master of Disguise (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is very much trading one specialty for another, so if you don&rsquo;t feel like being a trap springer, you can be a disguise master. &nbsp;Personally, I like disguising more, so it&rsquo;s personal preference here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">2nd </span><span class="c0">Voice Mimicry (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Another trade for something you probably don&rsquo;t care about, but if you&rsquo;re checking out this archetype, you want to fake being other people, and this really helps you pull it off.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">2nd </span><span class="c11 c3">Mimic Master (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is actually really nice, since the bane of disguise spells was taking on certain personas. &nbsp;With this, you&rsquo;re actually really good at faking being anyone, and for very little cost too.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c23 c4 c3">Lamplighter (****)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">1st</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c12">Class Skills (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Neither of these were important, but losing class skills isn&rsquo;t great.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">1st</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Lamplighter (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Nice name drop, and nice ability too. &nbsp;Nice and flavorful, it&rsquo;s a solid early level tool.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">2nd</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c11 c3">Alchemical Illumination (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;For what you lose, these abilities are great. &nbsp;More fun light spells that only dump poison use, making them a solid trade for any investigator.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">3rd </span><span class="c11 c3">Ready for the Revelation (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;And another great trade, this will keep you going first at all times. &nbsp;Using intelligence for initiative instead of dexterity isn&rsquo;t amazing, but the 12th level bump to this certainly makes it worth it, and it only gets better into the late game.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c23 c0 c7">Mastermind</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">1st </span><span class="c0">Mastermind Inspiration (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;I like the skills here more than your default skills, but this is for more of a personal investigator. &nbsp;But as with the Infiltrator, if you&rsquo;re looking at this archetype, it&rsquo;s going to help.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">1st </span><span class="c0">A Quiet Word (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is more situational, but sometimes your GM may go out of their way to have a quiet player involve themselves in the story.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">4th </span><span class="c3 c12">Mastermind Defense (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Now this is a bit weaker, as it only applies to one attack. &nbsp;Swift Alchemy isn&rsquo;t hard to lose, but you&rsquo;re not getting a lot for it, and it&rsquo;s pretty expensive without Combat Inspiration.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">9th I</span><span class="c0">mpregnable Mind (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;For this kind of character, this is decently powerful. &nbsp;The only problem is this has to compete with Combat Inspiration, which is a hard call. &nbsp;But it&rsquo;s a unique ability, which just barely wins out.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c23 c0 c7">Psychic Detective (***)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">1st </span><span class="c3 c12">Class Skills (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp; Losing class skills without gaining anything, not great.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">1st </span><span class="c0">Spell Casting (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Touche, Paizo. &nbsp;I said anything that loses alchemy as red, but I wasn&rsquo;t expecting them to get an alternative spellcasting type. &nbsp;Personally, I like alchemy more than psychic casting, but the list of spells/extracts aren&rsquo;t wide enough that there&rsquo;s a direct winner here, so this is more a change in playstyle that you&rsquo;ll have to decide works for you, but it&rsquo;s not a step down.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">2nd </span><span class="c0">Psychic Medler (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Again, we&rsquo;re trading one situational ability for another, but it&rsquo;s psychic magic instead of poison. &nbsp;Again, it&rsquo;s about as good as the trade, although the bonus to dispelling psychic stuff is nice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">3rd</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Phrenic Dabbler (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Since 3rd level isn&rsquo;t great for talents, this is a decent trade, although pushing back your ability to pick up extra investigator talent isn&rsquo;t great. &nbsp;Overall, you&rsquo;re breaking slightly less than even.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c23 c0 c7">Relentless Inspector (***)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">1st</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c11 c3">Interrogation (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While I&rsquo;m not big on the intimidate check, the sense motive bonus is huge, making this more than a fair trade for the less than stellar trapfinding.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">3rd </span><span class="c11 c3">Keen Mind (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Since I was never big on poison resistance or trap sense, and this is a boost to an amazing skill and your weakest save, this is a net gain by far.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">3rd </span><span class="c3 c12">Keen Tracking (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Now here we lose some steam, as perceptive tracking wasn&rsquo;t anything amazing, and being forced to take it isn&rsquo;t terrible. &nbsp;This rates lower if your GM doesn&rsquo;t consider you to have the investigator talent class feature, as it prevents you from taking the extra investigator talent at 5th level, where you need it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">5th </span><span class="c0">Relentless Pursuit (***)</span><span>&nbsp;So you get to pick a specific favored enemy if you&rsquo;ve tracked them, but now we&rsquo;re losing our 5th level talent, aka swift study. &nbsp;As a GM, I&rsquo;d rule that you could still take the extra investigator talent since keen tracking simply forced you to take perceptive tracking, so to me that&rsquo;d still qualify as having the investigator talent class feature. &nbsp;This is low orange if your GM doesn&rsquo;t agree.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c23 c7 c14 c3">Sleuth (*)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">1st </span><span class="c14 c3">Sleuth&rsquo;s Luck (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Remember that rule? &nbsp;That rule about giving up Alchemy? &nbsp;This breaks it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">1st </span><span class="c14 c3">Deeds (*) </span><span class="c2">Same rule still broken, look elsewhere.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p

</span><span class="c14 c3">Commune with Spirits (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Same rule broken.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">2nd </span><span class="c14 c3">Spirit Sense (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Broken.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">2nd </span><span class="c14 c3">Strong Life (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Still broken.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">3rd </span><span class="c14 c3">Sixth Sense (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Not unbroken.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">4th </span><span class="c14 c3">Whispering Spirits (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Seriously, Apollo Justice is fun. &nbsp;Sure, the story is a little weaker than the others, but there&rsquo;s no real problem with it, and Trucy is a lot of fun. &nbsp;Lack of Gumshoe is kind of sad though.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">11th </span><span class="c14 c3">Touched by the Beyond (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Broken.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c23 c0 c7">Steel Hound (***)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">1st </span><span class="c0">Weapon and Armor Proficiencies (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;What you&rsquo;re trading is worth having a gun, although the biggest problem with guns are that they can&rsquo;t be made into Inspired weapons, which are pretty important for you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">2nd </span><span class="c0">Packing Heat (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This makes you not worthless with guns, although it&rsquo;s annoying waiting a level before getting your trademark weapon. &nbsp;Still, the bonus feats are nice, as is getting a grit pool.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">3rd </span><span class="c0">Investigator Talents (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Rapid Reload is the only talent you should trade, and even that is kinda meh, since you get a feat whenever you get a talent anyways.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">4th </span><span class="c0">Shot in the Dark (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You&rsquo;re not really trading anything for this, and grit is a different resource pool, so there&rsquo;s no problem with getting a little bonus accuracy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">11th </span><span class="c0">Talented Shot (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This can actually get pretty good once you can pick up some of the later deeds, which can end up pretty powerful.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><a id="id.85rlvy4vy6et"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c16 c7 c3 c26">Multiclassing</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Multiclassing is a hard thing for investigators, since they don&rsquo;t hit stride until 4th level, so any levels that you&rsquo;re skipping out before that is another is a level that you&rsquo;re not getting Studied Combat. &nbsp;Any level that you&rsquo;re not taking also lowers the damage for your Studied Combat. &nbsp;Seriously, your early game sucks, and using Inspiration for combat before 9th level makes you burn through it too fast.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The most of a dip I can suggest for an investigator is two levels, since you have so much that requires you to advance in your base class. &nbsp;Even one level away from your base class is painful, but some classes are just good enough to validate it. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m going to try to only list classes you can use, since there&rsquo;s plenty of classes that you can dip into that don&rsquo;t gie you anything worth having.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fighter (***)</span><span>&nbsp;There&rsquo;s really only two archetypes I like here, one being </span><span class="c0">Unbreakable (***)</span><span>&nbsp;for those of you who want to go the endurance/diehard route, or </span><span class="c0">Trench Fighter (***)</span><span>. &nbsp;Trench Fighter breaks my rule, since you need 3 levels in it to make it worth taking. &nbsp;But getting dex to damage with ranged attacks is SO good, and this is the fastest path to it. &nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Base Fighter (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;isn&rsquo;t terrible either, as you EAT feats, so if you&rsquo;re going ranged, this is fine too, especially since most melee fighters have no reason why not to wear heavy armor.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Monk (***)</span><span>&nbsp;Really the only thing I like here is </span><span class="c0">Master of Many Styles (***)</span><span class="c2">. &nbsp;The biggest bonus is getting to basically finish off any style chain, and I myself like Pummeling Style, as it leads to pounce through Pummeling Charge. &nbsp;Unarmed combat isn&rsquo;t a bad style to go, and having hands open makes sure you can always down an extract as well, so it&rsquo;s worth checking out if you want some martial arts with your hardcore investigating.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c3">Swashbuckler (****)</span><span>&nbsp;You&rsquo;re here for one reason, and one reason alone: </span><span class="c11 c3">Inspired Blade (****)</span><span class="c2">. &nbsp;A handful of Panache (that sounds so cool) is nice, but getting free Weapon Finesse and Weapon Focus for the rapier is amazing, a better deal than even the Fighter gets. &nbsp;Picking up a few deeds too, including parry, and a slight reflex boost is pretty nice, and it&rsquo;s great for dex investigators to hold off from their massive feat tax.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c7 c3"><a class="c5" href="#id.jf7rp62bnfq0">Return to Table of

class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">What are you without a solid set a tools? &nbsp;Investigators are very much tool characters, and are at their best with a strong and diverse array of items at their disposal. &nbsp;With your strong Alchemy ability, you have a lot of items you can make yourself, meaning you&rsquo;re that much more likely to surprise someone without needing magic, which can be an advantage that tips the scales in your favor. &nbsp;Creativity is very important in your item use, so make sure to always be mixing things up.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c16 c7 c3">Mundane Items</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c3">Weapons</span></p><p class="c1"><span>These are the items that will lead to the most basic of your offense. &nbsp;Probably the most important of these decisions is that of your weapon, since it&rsquo;s probably where you&rsquo;ll make your first decision about being a strength or dex based investigator. &nbsp;Choose your weapon well, as it&rsquo;ll be one of your longest enduring character choices. &nbsp;Weapons with a * next to them may have the &ldquo;Inspired&rdquo; weapon quality added to them.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dagger/Short Sword (***)</span><span class="c2">* An old standby, and one you&rsquo;re quite good with. &nbsp;This will be a staple for two weapon fighters who don&rsquo;t want to use a feat or dip into other classes, but there&rsquo;s no way to get this as a dex to damage weapon. &nbsp;The biggest difference between dagger and short sword is damage, and the throwing property of the daggers, as well as how easy daggers are to conceal, so make your choice based on these factors.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sap (***)</span><span class="c2">* This shouldn&rsquo;t be a main weapon, but you should keep one on you at all times, as being able to deal nonlethal damage easily is often useful for investigating, since you&rsquo;ll need to take people alive.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c3">Rapier (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The one handed dex weapon of choice, this weapon has a great crit rate as well as serviceable damage and you&rsquo;re proficient with it, although you will need feats to hit with dex to damage, which can be somewhat of a feat sink. &nbsp;Overall, probably your best dex weapon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c3">Long Spear (****)</span><span class="c2">* The two handed weapon of choice for range monsters, it&rsquo;s simple and elegant, making for some incredible reach with some of your better extracts. &nbsp;While there&rsquo;s more impressive reach weapons, you start proficient with this and it can be made Inspired, which is a huge boon for you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Short Bow (***)</span><span class="c2">* The best ranged weapon you start proficient with, this is your best call for a ranged character, since it can be Inspired and bows are really quite nice in PF. &nbsp;There&rsquo;ll be quite a feat investment for this, as well as needing a bit of strength to get the most out of this, but if you&rsquo;re going ranged, you&rsquo;re using this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c12">One Handed (**)</span><span>/</span><span class="c14 c3">Two Handed Guns (*)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">While I really like guns, they lack some of the most important things you enjoy, such as Inspired weapons, a stat to damage, or easy reload times. &nbsp;You can get a one handed gun down to free reloads for a feat (and two handed with a Musket Master dip), but that&rsquo;s MORE feats you&rsquo;re pouring into ranged combat when it&rsquo;s already the most feat intensive route you can take. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a shame because guns seem so iconic for them, but firearms aren&rsquo;t your best friend here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dueling Sword (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The advantage of this weapon is being a 1 handed weapon that allows you to use weapon finesse, meaning that Slashing Grace will work to make this a dex to damage weapon. &nbsp;The problem is that it&rsquo;s exotic, which means you&rsquo;ll be using a feat to get it. &nbsp;There is a trait (Sword Scion) which gives you a permanent +1 to attack rolls with it though, but these are difficult to dual wield, making it a singleton weapon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sawtooth Sabre (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The advantage of these weapons is a reduced TWF penalty for a 1 handed weapon, although they&rsquo;re also exotic, requiring a feat. &nbsp;They also require a dip into Inspired Blade in order to qualify for Slashing Grace, but they are a dex to damage dual wield accessible blade, making them worth considering.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unarmed Combat (***)</span><span class="c2">*I myself like this, although it&rsquo;s only for strength investigators. &nbsp;The only reason I&rsquo;d pursue this is with a MOMS dip for a nice style, but with it, you&rsquo;re pretty powerful. &nbsp;According to PFSRD, unarmed combat is also considered a simple weapon, making it open for Inspired.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c3">Natural Attacks (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Aside from being unable to be Inspired (which is debatable if unarmed strikes can be), this will be a style many of you may be using without thinking, taking the forms of creatures with multiple natural weapons. &nbsp;With the right racial setup, you can start off with claw/claw/bite, and work your way up from there with extracts for short periods of time, making investing in this style a great way to deal damage. &nbsp;Especially early game before iterative attacks, this is probably the best way to deal damage for strength investigators.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c3">Armor</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c3">Hamaki (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;For those of you using dex, this will keep you from hitting max dex bonus. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s weak as far as armor goes, but it&rsquo;s fine for what you need it for, which is really just throwing magical enchantments on.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c3">Chainshirt (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Your best armor early, it&rsquo;ll be good for quite a while. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s really no need to go past this if you don&rsquo;t want to, and it&rsquo;s always going to be the gold standard of light armor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c3">Mithril Kikko Armor (****)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span>For 3k more than a chainshirt, you can get an additional +1 AC that stacks with everything else, making this something you&rsquo;d want to pick up instead of just upgrading a chainshirt.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mithril Full Plate (***)</span><span>&nbsp;Only for strength investigators who are willing to get Comfort on their armor (+3 is where this finally eases things, although you could take Armor Expert trait for just +2 to work), although the max dex bonus keeps this from being used by dex investigators.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c3">Buckler (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Once you get a masterwork buckler (which are very cheap), you have no reason why not to strap it to your forearm and wreck some faces. With a 0 ACP, it&#39;s not a hindrance at all, adds to your flat footed AC, and lets you throw other bonuses on for the fun of it. Pick up a buckler now.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Alchemical and Misc Items</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Another section which

a lot of GMs on accessibility. &nbsp;In this respect, I suggest not planning too heavily upon them, although recognize the value and power they do add to your character. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s not much that changes between this and the Alchemist, although most of the ranged options do not, as ranged is still far more difficult to pull off with an investigator, and those options should be slightly lower because of it.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c3"><a class="c5"

Items</a></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">There are a few things that I will be covering in more detail though, such as:</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c17 c7 c3">Weapon</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">+1 </span><span class="c11 c3">Inspired (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t think this is perfect, but it&rsquo;s very nice. &nbsp;It has a few flaws, such as only being able to be used with weapons that the investigator is proficient with by virtue of the class (so no Inspired scythes, guns, or anything like that.) &nbsp;But what it will do is drop the cost of using Inspiration on attacks by 1, which is great since normally it&rsquo;s so expensive to use with attack rolls. &nbsp;Even better, if you already have the Combat Inspiration, it&rsquo;ll add twice the Inspiration roll to your damage, adding anywhere between 2-12 (16) damage.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c17 c7 c3">Armor</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c17 c7 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">4500 GP </span><span class="c0">Restful (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Not the first thing you want to get on your armor, but when you can afford it, it&rsquo;s a solid investment to keep people from sleeping during watch, great for the whole party.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Rings</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">3500 GP </span><span class="c0">Ring of Eloquence (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;At low to mid levels, this is a really cheap way to learn some languages, better than burning an extract on both tongues and understand language. &nbsp;Not an everyday ring, but situationally useful.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Wondrous Items</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">2500 GP </span><span class="c11 c3">Effortless Lace (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Oh man, now THIS is an item. &nbsp;You pop it on any slashing/piercing weapon sized for you, and it makes it work with Weapon Finesse. &nbsp;This is super cheap, and helps you get even better dex to damage weapons, which is incredibly helpful. &nbsp;Almost all dex fighters are going to want a few of these.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">4500 GP </span><span class="c0">Brass Spider (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;For those of you who enjoy disabling things, this will keep you doing it longer, as 15 feet away from most trap is generally a pretty safe distance to avoid the worst effects of things.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">7000 GP </span><span class="c0">Investigator&rsquo;s Hat (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Not just for being stylish, this is a nice way to push your Inspiration budget even further, even if it does limit you to that point you get until you burn it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">8000 GP </span><span class="c0">Cup of Rapport (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Another gift for the social types, any advantage you can get to discussing things with someone is nice, making you even more charismatic and awesome than you already were. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a little pricey but it&rsquo;s also an untyped bonus, meaning it stacks with everything.</span></p><p class="c1

and that&rsquo;s where I come in. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m going to make these without dipping or considering racials (sorry, humans) so that they&rsquo;re as universal as possible. &nbsp;They&rsquo;re also not being made with the house rules that I put above, since I want these to be universal. &nbsp;If you want, feel free to change that, but this will basically be the feat/talent selection that is

class="c2">While I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s feats that could work for these builds, Strength is probably the first to finish feat wise. &nbsp;Honestly after about 11th level for both strength and dex builds, you have free reign to select whatever you want, as you can see the later levels are basically set in stone for getting Eternal Potion. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s not a huge amount of options you have late game, and the ones that you do have are generally widely different in value (Combat Inspiration, Greater is hype, as is Eternal Potion), so you don&rsquo;t have a huge amount of choices if you&rsquo;re trying to optimize.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ranged is the only style that&rsquo;s almost entirely set in stone (you can mix things around, but just barely), since it&rsquo;s so painfully feat intensive. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll probably spend the entire game trying to &lsquo;go online&rsquo; since your feat progression isn&rsquo;t merciful at all, so you&rsquo;re basically shackled to it as long as you&rsquo;re trying to squeeze all the meaty goodness out of this style of combat.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span
