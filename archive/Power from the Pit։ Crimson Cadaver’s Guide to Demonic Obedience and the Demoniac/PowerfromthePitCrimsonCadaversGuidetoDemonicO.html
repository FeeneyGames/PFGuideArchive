If you go the object route, then you can try and get around it by burning something that is supposed to be burnt, like Incense. &nbsp;Granted it would have to be some pretty expensive incense, but I imagine that you could probably find that sort of thing in your average city. &nbsp;Alternatively, depending on how your GM interprets the wording of the Obedience, you may not have to eat the burned objects. &nbsp;If that is the case, you could get away with casting </span><span class="c0">Mending</span><span>&nbsp;or </span><span class="c0">Make Whole</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;to repair your item, effectively making this a one-time investment of 100 GP. &nbsp;For those who follow through with this, your reward is a +4 bonus on saves vs. Fire effects. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Consequences: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4">As I covered above, this guy&rsquo;s unholy ritual is a pain in the ash to complete. &nbsp;Also, I would be careful performing this Obedience in a wooden building (such as your average inn).</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">1</span><span class="c6 c10">st</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;Boon</span><span class="c4">: A pretty standard group of blasting spells.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8">2</span><span class="c10 c8">nd</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Boon</span><span class="c4">: Resist 30 against the most common form of elemental damage is pretty solid. &nbsp;You are also, in theory, immune to the effects of common flames &ndash;

or at least a rat/squirrel/common verminous animal of choice. &nbsp;You can also carry a sharpened stick (or several) with you, and if you are in the city, you can leave your sacrifice in a nearby alley. &nbsp;Your reward for completing this convoluted ritual is a +4 bonus on saves against Disease and Poison caused by exposure to the jungle, or by creatures native to swamps.</span></p><p class="c3"><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Consequences: </span><span class="c4">You might smell a bit off, and you&rsquo;ll probably want to put your sacrifices somewhere separate from where you sleep at night, just in case.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">1</span><span class="c6 c10">st</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;Boon</span><span class="c4">: Decent utility spells (and pretty thematic), but not too exciting.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8">2</span><span class="c10 c8">nd</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Boon</span><span class="c4">: A flat +3 Natural Armour Bonus is pretty good, even if it loses its lustre later on.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8">3</span><span class="c10 c8">rd</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Boon</span><span>: Now this feels like a 3</span><span class="c10">rd</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;tier Boon &ndash;

if the moon is visible, then you just have to pray in an area where you can see the night sky. &nbsp;However, if the moon is not visible, than things get more complicated. &nbsp;And by complicated, I mean that you have to ritualistically kill a creature &ndash; of your own race, no less &ndash; by tearing out their throat with your teeth and consuming some of their still-warm body. &nbsp;Yep. &nbsp;For all that work, you get a +4 bonus on all saving throws you make while the moon is visible in the sky.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Consequences: </span><span class="c4">If you are able to perform the first, non-murder-y version of this Obedience, then you&rsquo;re in the clear &ndash;

other than saying that you should probably play a Human (or whatever is populous in the area you&rsquo;ll be in). &nbsp;Also, because of how the benefit works, it encourages you to play a more nocturnal character, which may or may not work with your party. &nbsp;Ultimately, though, I feel that the biggest consequence of following this Obedience is that it forces your GM to take into account the phases of the moon + whether or not you will be able to see it from where you are.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">1</span><span class="c6 c10">st</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;Boon</span><span class="c4">: Not the best, but not horrible &ndash;

which is pretty sweet.).</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Overall: </span><span class="c4">Jezelda&rsquo;s later boons are fun and thematic, and if it wasn&rsquo;t for her barbaric and oddly specific Obedience, she could have been a contender. &nbsp;Also, on an unrelated note, I have developed an aversion to the word lycanthrope.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7 c1">Jubilex</span><span class="c14 c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c15 c1">- The Faceless Lord</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c12 c1">Demon Lord of ooze monsters, poison, and sloth</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c8">Obedience</span><span class="c4">: Pray to Jubilex while you submerge a severed human body part in a vial of acid, letting it melt and dissolve. &nbsp;Pretty simple, once you obtain a vial of acid or two &ndash; just make a habit of slicing and dicing the corpses of any human enemies you come across. &nbsp;Hey, if you budget out the pieces carefully enough, you might be able to make one corpse last an entire adventure (though it helps if you have some sort of extra dimensional space to store it in). &nbsp;For this, you gain a +4 on saves vs. Poison.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Consequences: </span><span>Other than the aforementioned</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">after-battle activities, there isn&rsquo;t much to worry about.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8">1</span><span class="c10 c8">st</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Boon</span><span>: All of these spells are useful, though </span><span class="c0">Grease</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;3/day is the standout for me. &nbsp;So many uses.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">2</span><span class="c6 c10">nd</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;Bo</span><span class="c8">on</span><span class="c4">: This is a pretty handy way to shut down a squishy character, and the fact that you can add it as a swift action when you attack is really nice, though it doesn&rsquo;t specifically call out whether or not the ability is wasted if you miss.

assuming you have a decent carry weight/an extra dimensional space to carry them in, you could just pick up some corpses while you adventure and then munch on them once they get old enough. &nbsp;Unfortunately, the benefit gained isn&rsquo;t great &ndash; a +4 bonus on saving throws vs. Paralysis and Disease effects from Undead enemies.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Consequences: </span><span class="c4">You&rsquo;re carrying around one or more dead bodies &ndash; not much more needs to be said. &nbsp;And if you are doing the carrying old-school (i.e. not in a Bag of Holding or similar), then the smell might prove to be an issue eventually.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">1</span><span class="c6 c10">st</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;Boon</span><span>: These spells are a mixed bag of &ldquo;Meh&rdquo;. &nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Deathwatch</span><span>&nbsp;has been known to see occasional use, and I have a soft spot for </span><span class="c0">Speak with Dead</span><span class="c4">, but that&rsquo;s about it.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8">2</span><span class="c10 c8">nd</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Boon</span><span>: </span><span class="c0">Create Undead</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;1/day, with automatic control of whatever you create. &nbsp;Very nice, especially if you&rsquo;re a martial/someone with sneak attack &ndash;

this one is really weird. &nbsp; After gaining this Boon, you are transformed into a Ghoul the next time you die &ndash; which isn&rsquo;t a great start, seeing as you have to die to get any benefit from this ability. &nbsp;What&rsquo;s more, there&rsquo;s no information for how this interacts with resurrection spells; does it only come into effect if you aren&rsquo;t revived for 24 hours? &nbsp;In addition, you are now Undead, which brings with it its own fair share of complications (and benefits).</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Overall: </span><span class="c4">While it might sound strange, I feel that this guy is best served by cultists with magically-enhanced carrying capacity. &nbsp;That being said, Kabriri&rsquo;s powers are pretty general, allowing many different types of characters to benefit from worshipping him.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c1 c11">Kostch</span><span class="c2 c1">tchie</span><span class="c1 c15">&nbsp;- The Deathless Frost</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c12 c1">Demon Lord of cold, giants, and revenge</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c11">Obedience</span><span>: This one doesn&rsquo;t just involve murder, but murder in a specific environment. &nbsp;You have spill the blood of a living creature onto snow-covered ground, and that creature has to die within one minute of the obedience ending. &nbsp;I personally do not know of a way to create snow in Pathfinder*. &nbsp;Even in snow-covered environs, this obedience is hard to pull off; while most of the others can be done in the seclusion of a tent or your room at the inn, this one requires you to be outside &ndash; it calls for &ldquo;snow covered </span><span class="c0">ground</span><span>&rdquo;, which most likely means snow covered </span><span class="c0">earth</span><span class="c4">. &nbsp;Your given reward for doing this is a +4 bonus on saves vs. against cold. &nbsp;Cold what, you may ask? &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know for certain.</span></p><p class="c3"><span>*With the exception of </span><span class="c0">Sleet Storm</span><span>&nbsp;or </span><span class="c0">Polar Midnight</span><span class="c4">, which is a tad overkill.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Consequences:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Not only have you abducted and killed an intelligent creature, but you&rsquo;re left a clue as to where the deed happened. &nbsp;If I had a colour worse than red, this one would be it.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8">1</span><span class="c10 c8">st</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Boon</span><span>: With the exception of </span><span class="c0">Chill Touch</span><span class="c4">, these spells are decent and useful to a wide array of characters.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">2</span><span class="c6 c10">nd</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;Boon</span><span class="c4">: Cold Resist 30, changing automatically to Fire Resist 30 if you are (or become) immune to Cold. &nbsp;Not as good as the flip-side Boon from Flauros, but still alright &ndash;

&ndash; or 2: kill something that&rsquo;s less than a week old. &nbsp;Every day. &nbsp;Ouch.</span></p><p class="c3"><span>I do, however, have some suggestions: if you would prefer to do the first option, you could simply have your character be infertile &ndash; therefore making your obedience &ldquo;have sex every day&rdquo;, which is slightly more manageable. &nbsp;If you would rather do the second option, then I would simply point out that most bugs have a lifespan of less than a week &ndash; meaning that, with an easygoing GM, you could get away with squashing a bug or two. &nbsp;If not, then it&rsquo;ll be up to you to find some baby alley rats or tiny squirrels to kill in the name of The Mother of Monsters (If you are particularly unscrupulous, you could also carry around with you a Familiar Satchel or similar container with some newborn/pregnant animals in it. &nbsp;If you wish to go that way, I will once again direct you to </span><span class="c13"><a class="c9" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/animals-animal-gear/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117645083000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1WBaZF_ZsQLE4dqCaTNwiJ">this page</a></span><span class="c4">&nbsp;of animal prices.) &nbsp;Regardless of this Obediences&rsquo;

the nice thing about using a </span><span class="c0">Dominate</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;spell on a rampaging monster is that &ldquo;Kill stuff&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t usually against their nature, so they won&rsquo;t get another save.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Overall:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;The First Succubus&rsquo;

if it is storming in your area, you have to cavort naked on a hill, mountaintop, or rooftop. &nbsp;If it isn&rsquo;t, you instead have to mutilate a non-evil being by cutting off its fingers, toes, arms, and legs &ndash; burning each piece to ash before working on the next. &nbsp;Note: it doesn&rsquo;t say anywhere that the creature you&rsquo;re hacking up has to be alive or humanoid, only that it has the applicable appendages/digits. &nbsp;Upon completing this Obedience, you gain a +4 bonus on saves against weather-related effects and spells.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Consequences:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;If there isn&rsquo;t a storm at your location when you go to perform your Obedience, then you have it fairly easy &ndash; unlike some of the others, you don&rsquo;t even need to carry entire corpses with you; just their torsos. &nbsp;If the sky has opened up, however, then I hope you aren&rsquo;t the shy type.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8">1</span><span class="c10 c8">st</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Boon</span><span>: </span><span class="c0">Obscuring Mist</span><span>&nbsp;3/day is a pretty sweet pickup, and </span><span class="c0">Call Lightning</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;can bring the pain if you use it in the right conditions &ndash;

A strong, thematic capstone for the Demon Lord of storms.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Overall:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re cool with performing his Obedience on a daily basis (and your GM is alright with figuring out the weather on any given day), then Urxehl is a really solid choice for a lot of characters.</span></p><p

class="c4">: Perch on a high place and survey the area around you. &nbsp;If the area you are in is uninhabited, you just have to stay there for an hour. &nbsp;If the area you are in is in a populated location, however, you have to make use that no passerby realizes you are a living creature. &nbsp;Anyone who does realize your true nature, you must kill before the hour&rsquo;s end. &nbsp;For doing this, you get a +4 bonus on saving throws against effects that cause Sickness, Nausea, Exhaustion, and Fatigue.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Consequences:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;In my mind, it would be fairly hard to figure out if you were discovered without some form of mind-reading/very obvious signs, such as someone pointing at you or running away from your perch. &nbsp;Aside from that, or if you are in a secluded location, this Obedience is fairly easy to do. &nbsp;Also, put some ranks in Climb &ndash; you might need them.</span></p><p class="c3"><span

class="c4">: Unless you proselytize to/orchestrate with the rest of your group to all worship The Horned Prince, this ability effectively amounts to a single-target Hero&rsquo;s Feast with a reduced consumption time. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s still pretty nice, though.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8">3</span><span class="c10 c8">rd</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Boon</span><span class="c4">: This boon is unique, flavorful, and powerful &ndash; always a good combination. &nbsp;This is another ability that really benefits from having a high Cha, especially because it&rsquo;s based off of a Fort save.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Overall: </span><span class="c4">You know, I have a theory about these Demon Lords &ndash; the less you&rsquo;ve heard about them beforehand, the more likely they are to have cool Boons. &nbsp;Xoveron certainly fits that description, with a colourful array of Boons that are both unique and decently strong. &nbsp;Just make sure you talk with your GM about how they would adjudicate the second version of big X&rsquo;s Obedience.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c12 c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p

least a dozen of the creepy-crawlies. &nbsp;Your reward for doing this a +4 bonus on saves against effects that cause slowness or magical aging, or anything that damages, drains, or penalizes ability scores.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Consequences:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;This Obedience has many problems, the base of all of them being the fact that you have to carry all the required materials with you wherever you go, or otherwise be able to create them when necessary. &nbsp;Because of that, I have a hard time seeing Yhidothrus being worshipped by many adventurers.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">1</span><span class="c6 c10">st</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;Boon</span><span>: Three fairly situational spells. &nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Gentle Repose</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is an interesting inclusion, as it&rsquo;s typically seen as a fairly benevolent spell.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8">2</span><span class="c10 c8">nd</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Boon</span><span>: This is pretty much the direct opposite of Mestama&rsquo;s 2</span><span class="c10">nd</span><span>&nbsp;Boon &ndash; you can, 1/day, cast a unique </span><span class="c0">Bestow Curse</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;that dramatically ages your chosen target, with no benefits to their mental scores. &nbsp;This Boon can be used effectively against most enemies &ndash; martial characters will have a harder time making the save (as well as being more strongly impacted by the penalty), and casters will become super fragile/clumsy/weak. &nbsp;Overall a solid power.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8">3</span><span class="c10 c8">rd</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Boon</span><span class="c4">: A pretty decent summoning spell, though you&rsquo;ll get more out of it if you&rsquo;re fighting Good opponents.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c12 c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Overall:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;For your average (demon-worshipping) adventurer, Yhidothrus is a hard one to justify following. &nbsp;His Boons are alright, but his Obedience is just inconvenient. &nbsp;For NPC villains, however, I could definitely see this guy getting some use. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span

Lord of vast caverns, reptiles, and troglodytes</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c11">Obedience</span><span class="c4">: Find a cavern with a stalagmite in it, and impale a living creature on said stalagmite in such a way that it does not immediately die &ndash; though they do not have to survive the entire obedience. &nbsp;You must then perform a creepy little song-and-dance around the stalagmite, stopping every ten minutes to push the impaled creature further down. &nbsp;You must also time your dance so that by the end of the obedience, the creature has reached the bottom of the stalagmite. &nbsp;If you manage to do this, you will gain a +4 bonus to saving throws against &ldquo;special attacks and spells&rdquo; originating from Reptilian creatures.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Consequences:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Unless your campaign takes place entirely underground/in a cavernous area, you&rsquo;re pretty much out of luck. &nbsp;Even then, this Obedience is harder to do than most of the killing-related ones, as you have to murder this creature in a very specific way AND scream praises to Zevgavizeb while doing so.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8">1</span><span class="c10 c8">st</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Boon</span><span class="c4">: As they say in the song, two

class="c4">: Okay, this is actually really sweet. &nbsp;Summoning Dinosaurs never really gets old, even though they won&rsquo;t be the kings of the earth at level 16. &nbsp;Also, because they possess the Fiendish template, they hit hardest when facing Good opponents &ndash; making this an even better ability for an NPC Boss.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">3</span><span class="c6 c10">rd</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;Bo</span><span class="c8">on</span><span class="c4">: I mean, I&rsquo;ll take it. &nbsp;A passive bonus to Con is good for everyone &ndash; as is an equal bonus to AC &ndash; but this still falls flat for a capstone.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Overall:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Zevgavizeb makes a fun Demon Lord for Evil, subterranean NPCs to worship; player characters, not so much. &nbsp;Also, for the love of the gods, never create a Svirfneblin worshipper of Zevgavizeb. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll make your GM cry.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c12 c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span

vampires</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c8">Obedience</span><span class="c4">: Nice &ndash; another Obedience that can be completed with consent from a party member (or a helpful Familiar or Animal Companion). &nbsp;For the first version of this obedience, you have to drink the blood of a willing creature, and then let them drink some of yours and meditate on the teachings of The Vampire Queen. &nbsp;Cool. &nbsp;The second version can be completed without the aid of others, but is a bit more problematic; you have to eat the flesh of a member of your own race &ldquo;until you are full&rdquo;. &nbsp;For following through with either version of this Obedience, you gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against the Supernatural abilities of Undead creatures.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Consequences:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Assuming you have a technique (or device) to drain blood without causing too much pain or damage to the target, this Obedience is, well, pretty painless. &nbsp;And if you can&rsquo;t convince one of your minions/party members to suck it up, you can simply grab some choice bits of corpses you find on your travels.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8">1</span><span class="c10 c8">st</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Boon</span><span>: </span><span class="c0">Spider Climb</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is a good utility spell, and the other two aren&rsquo;t awful either.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8">2</span><span class="c10 c8">nd</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Boon</span><span>: Gaining the combined benefits of </span><span class="c0">Death Knell</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c0">Hero&rsquo;s Feast </span><span class="c4">as a

class="c16">on</span><span class="c4">: I think that this, right here, might just be my favorite Boon. &nbsp;For a few rounds per day (plus your Charisma modifier), you get to turn into a Vampire. &nbsp;Not only does this increase your ability scores, but it gives you a wide variety of offensive and defensive tools and powers that are as awesome as they are flavorful. &nbsp;That being said, however, it also comes with a wide variety of drawbacks &ndash; this is a power that really rewards careful research about how it works. &nbsp;Because of its randomized duration and many drawbacks, it isn&rsquo;t the strongest tier-3 Boon out there. &nbsp;Is it still worth picking up (especially through Demoniac early access)? &nbsp;I&rsquo;d say so.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Overall:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Looks like the demonic Vampires beat out the demonic Werewolves this time around &ndash; Zura&rsquo;s given powers are all pretty solid, with tangible benefits for almost all characters, and her obedience is one of the more reasonable ones. &nbsp;All in all a decent and thematic choice.</span></p><p

c5"><span class="c12 c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">That&rsquo;s all fine and good. &nbsp;However, there is one more step before you get to access your fun new toys:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Special</span><span>: </span><span class="c12 c1">Must have been physically traumatized by a demon&mdash;either reduced to negative hit points by a demon&rsquo;s physical attacks, taken a total of 10 or more points of ability damage or drain from a demon&rsquo;s special attack (this total damage can be from multiple attacks as long as the total is 10 or more in all), or spent at least 1 day under a demon&rsquo;s control (either via charm or compulsion effects or via demonic possession).</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c12 c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">Thankfully, there is an aside that makes this part a little less problematic:</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c12 c1">Note that this demon need not be one encountered during an adventure&mdash;many would-be demoniacs simply summon a demon and command it to aid in fulfilling this requirement.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">While I may come back to this at a later date, the method that you choose for completing this is pretty much up to you. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s obviously a lot easier to do if you are a spellcaster (as you can summon the demon yourself), and being possessed by a Demon for 24 hours seems like a very bad idea on paper, but other than that I would simply recommend doing whatever you feel works best for you and your group. &nbsp;Best of luck.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">Now we get to the fun stuff &ndash; the profane gifts (aka Class Features) of the Demoniac.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c6">Demonic</span><span class="c1 c16">&nbsp;Mark</span><span class="c4">: This ability is really awesome &ndash; your Demon Lord&rsquo;s unholy symbol appears somewhere on your body as an unholy brand, which 1: functions as an Unholy Symbol with regards to divine spellcasting, and 2: allows you to, 1/day, spend a free action when you cast a spell to have that spell not be expended &ndash; effectively a free Pearl of Power of any level you can cast. &nbsp;Spells cast in this way gain the Chaotic and Evil descriptors, which may be a boon or a bane depending on your situation.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">Obviously, this ability has little to no use for a non-spellcaster, but that&rsquo;s not really the target demographic for this PrC.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c6">Damned</span><span class="c4">: You&rsquo;re on a highway to Hell&hellip; or rather, the Abyss. &nbsp;Basically, whenever someone tries to resurrect you, they have to make a caster level check; if they fail, they can&rsquo;t try to raise you for 24 hours. &nbsp;This is a bit of an inconvenience, especially in combat, but not game-breaking.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Obedience</span><span class="c4">: In order to maintain the bonuses from being a Demoniac (including spell progression), you have to perform your Demonic Obedience every day. &nbsp;How much of a drawback this is will depend on your Demon Lord of choice, but it&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;ll need to keep in mind when playing this Prestige Class.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c20 c11">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c6">Energ</span><span class="c1 c8">umen</span><span class="c1">: </span><span>Aside from getting early access to your Demonic Boons, this is the flagship ability of the Prestige Class.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; </span><span class="c4">And what an ability it is.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">When you activate this ability, your spirit is merged with that of a Demon, giving you +2 Profane bonus to any one ability score of your choice.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">At level 5, it gives you a +4 bonus to any one ability score, as well as electricity resistance 10, and a +4 bonus on saving throws vs. poison.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">And at level 7, you get a +6 bonus to any one ability score, as well as flat-out immunity to Electricity and Poison.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">Now, you might be thinking &ldquo;Wow, that&rsquo;s a pretty neat ability. &nbsp;Why does it have a split rating?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">First off, the duration is slightly pants: it only lasts a number of rounds equal to your Demoniac level, and can only be used once per day.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">And, just like a lot of the abilities we&rsquo;ve seen so far, this one has a drawback &ndash; and a fairly big one to boot.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">Once the duration is up, the demon whom you are sharing your body with tries to press their advantage and take over your mind &ndash; you become Confused for a number of rounds equal to the amount of time spent under the influence.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>Thankfully, there is way to counteract this: being affected by a </span><span class="c0">Protection from Evil/Chaos</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;spell stops the Confusion effect in its tracks &ndash; but it also cancels the positive effects if applied before they end. &nbsp;In addition, at the start of every round that you spend possessed, you can try and make a DC 25 Will save to shake off the effect.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>Because of that, I see this as being more of a last ditch effort type ability, as opposed to something that you will make use of every day. &nbsp;Your best bet would probably be to use the stat boost to increase your casting stat, and then use the limited duration to lay into people with your best save-or-dies. &nbsp;If you&#39;re more of a weapon-wielder, you could instead hulk out and raise your physical stat of choice - or boost your Con to avoid dying by any means necessary. &nbsp;In any case, picking up a wand of </span><span class="c0">Protection from Evil/Chaos</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;might be a wise idea. &nbsp;Best case scenario, you have a spotter who can stay near you and use it on you when the time is up (If you don&rsquo;t trust your party members to do it, then a Familiar or Cohort (via Leadership or similar) could do it.). &nbsp;Worst case scenario, you can use it on yourself - though that means that you&rsquo;ll miss out on the last round&rsquo;s benefits.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Demonic Boons: </span><span class="c4">Just as a reminder, via taking levels in Demoniac you will get your Demonic Boons at level 10, 13, and 16, instead of levels 12, 16, and 20, assuming you enter into it at the earliest opportunity.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c8">Summon Demon</span><span class="c1">: </span><span>Starting at level 4, once per day you may summon one Succubus, 1d3 Babaus, or 1d4+1 Brimoraks. &nbsp;At 8</span><span class="c10">th</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;level, you can instead call forth one Hezrou, 1d3 Vrocks, or 1d4+1 Succubi to fight for you. &nbsp;Or do other stuff. &nbsp;I won&rsquo;t judge.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c8">Demonic</span><span class="c1 c27">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c16">Form</span><span class="c4">: This is your capstone, and it is suitably awesome. &nbsp;Once per day, you can transform into a unique Demon; you gain a bunch of nice benefits befitting your new form, as well as one ability chosen from a list &ndash; including a variety of natural attacks, the ability to breathe underwater, and wings (note that the customization, once chosen, cannot be changed afterwards). &nbsp;You can stay in this form for a number of minutes per day equal to your caster level, spent in 1-minute increments. &nbsp;All in all a pretty cool power, even if it&rsquo;s not the most powerful thing in the world at level 17.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c23 c1">Ex-Demoniacs</span><span class="c1">:</span><span>&nbsp;Wanted to mention this quickly before we move on to the next section: much like a Cleric, if you act severely against the will of your demonic patron, or if your Alignment changes to anything other than CE, you can have your powers and class features stripped from you (except for </span><span class="c1">Damned</span><span class="c4">)*. &nbsp;Yet another reason why you shouldn&#39;t tick off a Demon Lord.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>*And, much like a Cleric, you can usually gain them back via a casting of </span><span class="c0">Atonement</span><span class="c4">. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c1 c21">Build advice</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">Before we begin, I would be the first person to admit that I am not the most proficient at building characters. &nbsp;These are simply my suggestions and general building advice, and should be taken with a grain of salt.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c19 c1">Class choice</span></p><p class="c3"><span>Right off the bat, the </span><span class="c1 c16">Oracle</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;seems to mesh well with everything the class has to offer; its 3/4s BaB and decent spellcasting, as well as its primary stat being Charisma mean that your Boons and SLAs will have higher DCs and/or more uses per day. &nbsp;The Oracle also has 4+int Skill Points, meaning that it will be slightly easier for you to fulfill that part of the Demoniac&rsquo;s prereqs. &nbsp;The downsides of the Oracle are that your Will save won&rsquo;t be as high as that of a Wisdom-based class, as well as the limited spell list of a Spontaneous caster.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>The </span><span class="c1 c8">Cleric</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;comes in as a close second, and is sort of the defensive/safe option of the bunch. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll have a higher Will save, though your Boon DCs won&rsquo;t be quite as high. &nbsp;On top of that, you have all the standards strengths of the Cleric &ndash; Domains, Channel Energy*, and unfettered access to the second best spell list in the game.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">*Though it will almost certainly be Negative Energy, which is slightly less useful than Positive IMHO.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>And if the Cleric is the defensive option, and the Oracle is the balanced option, then the </span><span class="c1 c8">Sorcerer</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is the hyper-offensive option. &nbsp;Coming in with d6 hit die instead of d8* and completely lacking native armour proficiency, the Sorcerer makes up for that with what will likely be the highest Charisma of any of the options presented. &nbsp;They also have a wider array of spells to choose from, which may be of benefit with certain Demon Lords (Socothbenoth and Mestama come to mind). &nbsp;Also, since you can&rsquo;t really do melee very well (though you do have Bloodlines that specialize in it), some Demon Lords may be worse options for you than most (Haagenti and Jezelda, for example). &nbsp;Overall the Sorcerer is a niche pick, but a powerful niche pick with some fun tools to play with.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">*meaning that you will actually gain HP from taking levels in Demoniac.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>In a similar vein, the </span><span class="c1 c6">Psy</span><span class="c1 c8">chic</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">would be cool to mess around with &ndash; while you lack the offensive punch of the Sorcerer, you bring more utility (and skill points) to the table as well as the ability to wear armour if you want to. &nbsp;Also, because of the way that Psychic Disciplines work, you can decide if you want to emphasize your Wisdom or Charisma to have higher DCs or a better Will save.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span>Another slightly safer option would be the </span><span class="c1 c8">Sha</span><span class="c1 c16">man</span><span class="c4">. &nbsp;With the Shaman, you get a good mix of both worlds; because of the fact you have Hexes to play with, you don&rsquo;t have to go into melee if you don&rsquo;t want to &ndash; even though you have the BaB and armour proficiencies to do so if you build that way. &nbsp;Because of this, a caster-based Shaman could have a 14 and above in all mental stats, giving you a solid Will save, good Boon/SLA DCs, AND a reasonable amount of Skill Points. &nbsp;On top of all that, you have the flexibility of the Spirits &ndash; making you able to channel Positive Energy when needed*, throw some wicked debuffs on occasion, and even do a little bit of blasting if want to. &nbsp;With a decent Intelligence, you could also use the Lore spirit to grab some choice Wizard/Sorcerer spells if you need them.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">The downside of the Shaman is the fact that your base spell list isn&rsquo;t the best (though that can be remedied by taking the Human FCB), and the fact that some of your best Hexes are dependent on your Shaman level, making them a bit weaker when multiclassing.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">*something only a Life oracle or a Cleric with one of a few suboptimal archetypes could do in your place.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>And last but not least, the </span><span class="c1 c8">Warpriest</span><span class="c4">. &nbsp;This flew under my radar when I started this guide, but the Warpriest is actually in a pretty good position to worship a Demon Lord &ndash; they also have d8 hit die and 3/4s BaB (though you&rsquo;ll want to mitigate that as much as possible), so they fit in well. &nbsp;The other options here have more magical clout, but the Warpriest has more physical oomph &ndash; working like the reverse of the Sorcerer above, you&rsquo;ll want your demoniac patron to have Boons relating to buffing your martial prowess and touch-range effects. &nbsp;In addition, you&rsquo;ll have a slightly higher Will save than the Sorcerer and Psychic, and if you go into Arsenal Chaplain you&rsquo;ll have more Feats to play with than any other class on this list. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>One more thing to note: if you play a Warpriest of Lamashtu, Shivaska, Sifkesh, or Zura, you can take the Madness Blessing. &nbsp;While the Minor Blessing is of minimal use, the Major Blessing allows you to control which result of the d100 Confused creatures near you count as getting (including yourself). &nbsp;This means that, after Energumen ends, you could choose to have yourself (and other confused creatures) act normally, and then use your standard action on that turn to cast </span><span class="c0">Protection from Evil/Chaos</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;on yourself and continue your day as normal. &nbsp;Pretty nifty.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">Quick tip: Regardless of which class you use, I would suggest waiting and picking up 8 levels of your base class, as most classes get cool/important stuff at level 8 (including your first iterative attack, which is especially important as a Warpriest).</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">Now that we&rsquo;ve gone through my recommendations for what classes work best with the Demoniac, now I will give you a list of some classes that I would not recommend going into Demoniac with.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c11">Any purely martial class</span><span class="c4">: There just isn&rsquo;t enough here for you to quantify losing that much BaB and HP.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">Wizards/Arcanists</span><span class="c4">: The fact that you don&rsquo;t learn new spells per level when you multiclass really sucks for the masters of magic and their half-blooded cousins. &nbsp;While they are strong classes, and you can always try to learn spells from scrolls and the spellbooks of others, they just aren&rsquo;t the best option for a Demoniac.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">Any 6</span><span class="c6 c10">th</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;level Spellcaster that isn&rsquo;t the Warpriest (Bards, Inquisitors, Alchemists, etc)</span><span class="c4">: Not progressing your class features is really rough for these guys, and the 9/10 spellcasting progression doesn&rsquo;t do enough for them to justify the switch.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">Witches</span><span class="c4">: Even more so than the Shaman, your Hexes are your bread and butter. &nbsp;Not having their DCs scale with you is kind of a death sentence for many Witch builds.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c21 c14 c1">Feats and Traits for a Demoniac</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c19 c1"></span></p><p

class="c3 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">If there was ever a feat tree that was made specifically with Demon-worshippers in mind, it would be this one. &nbsp;As you take feats from this line, your soul will be pulled closer to the Abyss, making you harder to resurrect. &nbsp;That being said, if you go into Demoniac, your soul will already be Damned, so there&rsquo;s no downside to taking the first feat.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>You can check out the link above for the full rundown, but going all the way culminates in being unable to be resurrected by anything short of a </span><span class="c0">Wish</span><span>&nbsp;or </span><span class="c0">Miracle</span><span class="c4">. &nbsp;Also, with every Damnation Feat you take, your Alignment shifts one step closer to your patron&rsquo;s - however, because you are a Demoniac, that isn&rsquo;t a problem for you; your Alignment is always going to be the same as your patron.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">The other unique thing about these feats is that their benefits scale depending on how many Damnation Feats you have - which, of course, tempts you into taking as many of them as possible. &nbsp;Choose wisely.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c17 c6"><a class="c9"

You gain resistances similar to those of your average Demon - Which means resistance to either Acid, Cold, or Fire damage. &nbsp;If you have one Damnation Feat, you get Resistance 5 to one of the elements listed above. &nbsp;With two Damnation Feats, you gain another 5 points of resistance to one of the aforementioned elements. &nbsp;If you already have Resistance to the element you select, this stacks with it. &nbsp;At three feats, you get Immunity to one of the three types of energy, and at four feats you become an Outsider (native), and gain Immunity to any energy type that a Demon would have Resistance or Immunity to. &nbsp;I would only really recommend this Damnation Feat if you know that you&rsquo;ll be taking a lot of elemental damage, and you won&rsquo;t have </span><span class="c0">Endure Elements</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;or similar handy.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><h1 class="c31" id="h.fwa84m2p1qke"><span class="c17 c29"><a class="c9"

class="c4">: Now this is the one you want. &nbsp;Upon taking this feat, you gain +1 to the DCs of any spell you cast with the Evil descriptor. &nbsp;This is awesome for several reasons:</span></h1><h1 class="c31" id="h.x15498f2jixp"><span class="c4">1: There are a lot of really cool Evil spells at all levels.</span></h1><h1 class="c31" id="h.y3syphiztnot"><span class="c34">2: You can turn any spell into an Evil spell via your Demonic Mark.</span></h1><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">If you only have one Damnation Feat, then that&rsquo;s all it does. &nbsp;If you have two Damnation Feats, however, you get a 1-level discount on Metamagic you put on Evil spells, to a minimum of +1 level above their original level.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">If you have three Damnation Feats, you get another +1 to the DCs of Evil spells you cast, and if you have four Damnation Feats you treat your caster level as being 2 higher for any level dependant effects in Evil spells you cast.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">While it does make you think about your spell choice a bit more than usual, I feel that it&rsquo;s still a pretty strong Feat for a Demoniac.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span

intrigue-heavy adventure. &nbsp;With your first Damnation Feat, this ability makes Alignment-detecting magic return an inconclusive result - which may end up making others &nbsp;more suspicious of you instead of less. &nbsp;If you have two feats, you choose an Alignment one step away from your actual one, and register as that alignment instead (which will, more often than not, be CN). &nbsp;With three feats under your belt, you can choose an Alignment two steps away from your own to masquerade as, and with four feats you gain the ability to instantly know when someone is trying to read your Alignment, and in addition to giving them whatever answer you desire, you also learn their name and Alignment. &nbsp;Cool, but specific.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p

the potency of Fear effects you&rsquo;ve already applied via Intimidate, instead of just extending the duration. &nbsp;Not bad, but if your DM allows you to use the Skill Unlock system, then

Damnation Feat, you get another +2 to Intimidate. &nbsp;You have now broken even with Skill Focus: Intimidate.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">And if you get a fourth Damnation Feat, you gain the ability to demoralize foes with Intimidate as a swift action. &nbsp;Alright, that&rsquo;s actually pretty sweet.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span

Affinity</a></span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(Tiefling Only): When casting spells with the Evil descriptor, you act as if your caster level is one higher than it actually is. &nbsp;Pretty sweet for a servant of darkness like yourself, and it stacks with the Damnation Feats I covered above.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p

of Foul Abaddon</a></span><span>&nbsp;(18,000 GP): Expensive but good. &nbsp;The Orb of Foul Abaddon has two powers: once per day, it can be used to fire a </span><span class="c0">Dread Bolt</span><span>&nbsp;at your enemies. &nbsp;It is, however, it&rsquo;s second power that makes it as useful (and expensive) as it is - if used as an additional spell focus, any spell you cast with the Evil descriptor is cast at +1 effective caster level. &nbsp;As far as I know, this also stacks with the Dark Magic Affinity Trait mentioned above. &nbsp;You never can have enough magic.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c17 c16"><a class="c9"

Blossom</a></span><span>&nbsp;(8,000GP): </span><span>Now, when you think of crazed demon-worshippers, you probably don&rsquo;t then immediately </span><span>think of</span><span>&nbsp;flowers. &nbsp;That being said, if you&rsquo;re playing a Demoniac, you&rsquo;ll want to keep an eye out for this pretty little lotus. &nbsp;When held, the Padma Blossom gives its owner a +3 bonus in concentration checks (which is pretty nice in itself) and also suppresses the following effects: M</span><span>orale bonuses</span><span>, Fear effects, and the </span><span class="c0">C</span><span class="c0">onfused</span><span>, D</span><span>azed</span><span>, or S</span><span>tunned</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;conditions. &nbsp;If you can obtain one of these puppies, utilizing Energumen becomes a much safer proposition - though you&rsquo;ll want to watch out if you use a two-handed weapon that you have a hand free to hold it in, and that it doesn&rsquo;t get squished during the rigors of adventuring. &nbsp;Also, you can cast Calm Emotions with it 2/day; that might come in handy if you (probably rightfully) end up angering anyone during your travels.</span></p><p class="c3
