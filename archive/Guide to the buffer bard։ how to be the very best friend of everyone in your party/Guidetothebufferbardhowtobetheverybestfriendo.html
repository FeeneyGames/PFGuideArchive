Introduction: &quot;Hello! My name is Buffer!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Hello travellers! This is my first guide, so I apologize for any mistake you will find reading it. I want to thank Treantmonk, Kbrewer and TarkTX for their great guides that inspired me. I also thank Andrea and Fabio, two friends of mine that helped me correcting the guide.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">This is not a guide for the bard in general, here you will find a way to make one of the most powerful buffer of the game (buffer as intended in the &quot;arm&quot; metaphore Tarkx wrote about; if you do not know what I&#39;m talking about I strongly suggest you to read this guide http://paizo.com/threads/rzs2p576?On-building-a-balanced-group-working-out-just ). For this reason i will not make a list of every of the 78361 feats, traits and spells of the game; I will list only the ones of some utility for this build. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">I&#39;ve started building this character while playing a master summoner, because I felt bad about not leaving any space to my comrades. So I began thinking about a new avatar. I wanted to cast spells, but I really hate DCs: when a foe surpasses a saving throw I feel really bad, like I wasted a turn. So I decided to play a buffer: a caster that let his pals belive they are the most deadly war machine. You win, your group win and everybody loves you.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Let&#39;s be clear: YOU WILL NOT ROLL A SINGLE DAMAGE DIE IN ALL CAMPAIGN. Well, this seems a little extreme, but truth is that even if you will never inflict a single damage directly, through your pals you will be doing more than others. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">This build is about morphing your comrades from simple soldier into Navy Seals; even if we are focusing into fights, this character will be valuable in every environment, your Bard (we&#39;ll call him Buffer) will become a real problem solver.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">I am currently playing buffer in a Rappan Athuk campaign, and i&#39;ve played it from level 1 to level 12; so most of my considerations comes directly from my personal experience, represent my thoughts and are not to be taken as rigid law.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">I will use the canonic color code:</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">GREAT </span><span class="c0">This should be your first choice.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">GOOD </span><span class="c0">More situational than blue, but also good. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c23">SOSO </span><span class="c0">Take this only when blue or green options are not available.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c12">BAD </span><span class="c0">Never take this. Never. Take toughness instead.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7">2. Class abilities: &quot;Bitch please, I&#39;m an artist in all I do&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">2.1 Bardic Performance</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">Bardic Performance </span><span>give you some pretty juicy buffs. First of all </span><span class="c2">inspire courage</span><span class="c0">: competence bonuses to attack and damage rolls, and morale bonus to will ST against fear. This is your bread and butter buff. It should be up every fight, every round. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Inspire competence </span><span>is less important, because you will use it more out of combat, but I find extremely useful using it during </span><span class="c5">disable device </span><span class="c0">rolls.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Dirge of doom</span><span>. You are thinking &quot;this is a debuff! WTF!!&quot;. Yes and no. </span><span class="c5">Shaken</span><span>&nbsp;gives a penalty of -2 to almost every rolls your enemies make. You can translate this in a buff to your pals: +2 AC, 2/- RD, +2 DC of spells. So until you unlock </span><span class="c5">inspire heroics</span><span>&nbsp;this is nice to use with </span><span class="c5">inspire courage</span><span>&nbsp;thanks to </span><span class="c5">virtuoso performance.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Inspire heroics </span><span class="c0">come in the late levels with +4 morale to AC and all ST. Good.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">2.2 Versatile Performance</span></p><p class="c6"><span>This is </span><span class="c4">GREEN</span><span class="c0">. It&#39;s a 3x6 sale at the discount. Choose keyboard, sing and dance in this order for maximum benefit.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">2.3 Well Versed</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10">Minor </span><span class="c0">bonus to will save. Meh.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">2.4 Lore Master</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Juicy metagaming! </span><span class="c0">You are the best in this, even your cardigan-fan wizard can&#39;t compete. Max all the knowledge you need in combat and put 1 rank in the others. I suggest you take 10 always, and 20 aganist serious danger.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">2.5 Jack-of-All-Trades</span></p><p class="c6"><span>The </span><span class="c2">golden </span><span class="c0">skill of the problem-solver. This is asking you to put 1 rank in every skill by level 16. Do not disappoint this class ability! </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7">3. Race &amp; Ability Scores: &quot;what can I say? I was born pretty and clever!&quot;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c19 c18">3.1 Ability Scores</span></p><p class="c6"><span>Buffer </span><span>should have a minimum </span><span class="c2">INT </span><span class="c0">score of 16 (post racial mod), better 18, and by the end of the campaing you will aim at 24-26. You will understand this when we will get to the skill section. </span></p><p class="c6"><span>The </span><span class="c2">CHA </span><span class="c0">is not important as other bards, we don&#39;t care about DCs, but you need to pump it anyway: it give you both bonus spells, rounds of bardic performance and it will affect half of your skills. I suggest a score of 16 (post racial mod); by the end of your campaign try to have it higher you can. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">CON </span><span>&amp; </span><span class="c4">DEX </span><span>are the next important ability scores. CON gives you lovely hit points and a bonus to fortitude saving throw, you should NEVER dump </span><span class="c4">CON</span><span>. </span><span class="c4">DEX </span><span>gives you initiative bonus and a bonus to reflex saving throws. While failing a reflex saving throw is not as bad as failing a fortitude one, you need a good </span><span class="c4">DEX</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;because the buffer bard should have an optimum initiative bonus. So try to get a 14 in both the ability.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10">WIS </span><span class="c0">is a nice one: bonus on perception and Will saving throw. Unfortunately we don&#39;t have enough points, so keep it around 10.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c12">STR </span><span class="c0">is useless. Dump it like you have never done. Without pity.</span></p><p class="c6"><span>TL;DR: The most important stats for you are </span><span class="c2">INT </span><span>and</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;CHA</span><span>, followed by </span><span class="c4">CON </span><span>and</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;DEC</span><span>; try to keep </span><span class="c10">WIS </span><span>near 10 and if you feel good about it, dump </span><span class="c12">STR</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">INT</span><span>=</span><span class="c2">CHA</span><span>&gt;</span><span class="c4">CON</span><span>=</span><span class="c4">DEX</span><span>&gt;</span><span class="c10">WIS</span><span>&gt;</span><span class="c14 c12">STR</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Point buy 15 (pre racial mod, you can swap INT and CHA)</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">STR: 7 DEX: 12 CON: 12 INT: 16 WIS: 10 CHA: 14 </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Point buy 20 (if you have racial bonus to INT or CHA you can put more point into CON and DEX)</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;STR: 7 DEX: 12 CON: 12 INT: 16 WIS: 10 CHA: 16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Point buy 25</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">STR: 7 DEX: 14 CON: 14 INT: 16 WIS: 9 CHA: 16</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">3.2 Races</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">We will examine three factors: racial mod, alternate favored class bonus, racial traits. We want bonus to INT, CHA, DEX and CON; race without bonus in 2 of these ability will not be taken in consideration.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Elf</span><span>: -2 CON hurts, but +2 INT and DEX are great. Elves immunities are great, you can swap </span><span class="c5">weapon familiarity</span><span>, </span><span class="c5">keen sense</span><span>, </span><span class="c5">lowlight</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c5">vision</span><span>&nbsp;to get </span><span class="c5">flat-footed</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c5">darkvision</span><span>. </span><span class="c5">Arcane focus</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is also good. Sadly alternate favored class bonus sucks.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Gnome</span><span>: The bonuses to ability score are almost perfect. Small size is very good for us. Racial traits are fantastic: swap </span><span class="c5">obsessive</span><span>&nbsp;for </span><span class="c5">academician</span><span>, </span><span class="c5">low light vision</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c5">keen sense</span><span>&nbsp;for </span><span class="c5">darkvision</span><span>, </span><span class="c5">defensive training</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c5">hatred</span><span>&nbsp;for </span><span class="c5">eternal hope</span><span>. Favored class options are also good. Gnome also unlock </span><span class="c2">Prankster</span><span class="c0">, a very interesting archetype. Second best race for the buffer bard!</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c12">Half elf</span><span class="c0">: bad, always choose human instead.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Halfling</span><span>: stats and size are great. Always choose </span><span class="c5">adaptable luck</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c5">fleet of foot</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;for maximum enjoyment. Favored class options are really bad :-(</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c12">Half orc</span><span class="c0">: better than half elf, but not enough.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Human</span><span class="c0">: The bonus talent makes you a better buffer earlier, bonus skill point is really welcome. Favored class option is really good (extra spell known are always great). Solid choice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Aasimar</span><span>: WOW! These guys rock! Emberkin give you +2 INT and +2 CAR, bonus vs illusions and </span><span class="c5">pyrotechnics</span><span class="c0">, great control spell. Favored class option is really too good: it give you the possibility to buff your pals for +8 to attack and damage at level 9. Best choice for buffers.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10">Catfolk</span><span class="c0">: good stats, but nothing more.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Fetchling</span><span>: not bad at all. They don&#39;t have favored class option but they have good stats and very good racial traits (</span><span class="c5">gloom shimmer, shadow magic, shadow blending </span><span>and</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;shadow resistance</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I&#39;m looking at you!).</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10">Merfolk</span><span class="c0">: well, it&#39;s the race with the best stats. Nothing more.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7">4. Traits: &quot;Man, I really need to play first&quot;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">2 rules:</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">1- YOU WORSHIP SERENRAE.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">2- You need to act before others in the group.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">I won&#39;t list ALL the traits of the game. Just the best two. Because there is no reason to choose differently. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Strenght of the Sun</span><span class="c0">:+1 to all CHA-based checks (concentration also). OMG.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Reactionary</span><span class="c0">: have I said you need to play first? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c11">5. Archetypes: &quot;I do not just </span><span class="c11 c5">sing, </span><span class="c7">you know?&quot;</span></p><p class="c6"><span>Core bards are perfect to make buffers. But it can be refreshing playing something different sometimes. We always want to keep </span><span class="c5">inspire</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c5">courage</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c5">inspire heroics</span><span>, possibly </span><span class="c5">inspire</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c5">competence</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c5">bardic knowledge</span><span>. I&#39;m going to examine only the archetypes that keep these class abilities. </span><span class="c5">Versatile performance</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c5">dirge of doom</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;are nice to have. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Archivist</span><span>: this archetype lose </span><span class="c5">versatile performance </span><span>and many useless stuff. In exchange we get to anticipate other useful stuff (</span><span class="c5">lore master </span><span>in primis). Also </span><span class="c5">inspire courage </span><span>is changed into </span><span class="c5">naturalist, </span><span>a slightly more defensive power. Pay attention, though, with </span><span class="c5">naturalist </span><span>and </span><span class="c5">inspire heroics</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;you will grant +10 AC and ST to your friends. Gross!</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Dirge bard</span><span>: not bad! </span><span class="c5">Dance of the Dead</span><span>&nbsp;let you create some decoy to control the battlefield. Use it in conjunction with </span><span class="c5">inspire</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c5">courage</span><span>&nbsp;through </span><span class="c5">virtuoso performance</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and just WIN. Not much else unfortunately.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Savage skald</span><span>: You exchange useless ability for some nasty tricks. The real beasts here are </span><span class="c5">incite rage</span><span>&nbsp;(stacks very well with </span><span class="c5">courageous</span><span>&nbsp;weapons) and </span><span class="c5">berserkergang</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c12">Songhealer</span><span class="c0">: last time i checked healing was terrible in pathfinder. Only for noobs.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Thundercaller</span><span>: I have contrastant feeling about this. PROS: it lets you doing some good damage while buffing pals. It give you access to </span><span class="c5">incite rage</span><span>. CONS: You don&#39;t get </span><span class="c5">bardic knowledge</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c5">inspire competence.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;OUCH!</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Prankster</span><span>: this is a very good archetype. It loses </span><span class="c5">lore master</span><span>, and it hurts. But with this archetype you can both buff and control the battlefield greatly. This come online really when you unlock </span><span class="c5">virtuoso performance,</span><span>&nbsp;so it does not fit the build well in the early level. Anyway when you can use two performance simultaniously it can become a real beast. For this build Int gets </span><span class="c10">so-so</span><span class="c21">&nbsp;</span><span class="c24">and you should invest all you have in CHA, because your DCs are much more important.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c11">6</span><span class="c7">. Feats: &quot;Let me show you a trick&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c18 c19">6.1 VIF (very important feats)</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">I am going to suggest feats from CRB, APG, UM, UC. However the build will also need some feats from other Paizo books:</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Flagbearer</span><span>: This feat is the core of the build. It gives you a constant effect of </span><span class="c5">bless</span><span>. Not so great in your opinion? Well consider this: from the point of view of action economy is really a win. You can always have the flag in your hand, so it&#39;s a buff your party will always have. But it is much better. In fact the first piece of magic equipment you should buy is the </span><span class="c5 c2">Banner of the ancient kings</span><span>. We are going to talk about this fantastic item later, for now you only need to know that it will grant your party a constant </span><span class="c5">good hope </span><span class="c0">effect. This is pure gold. This feat come from ISWG. Kill your DM if you need it because you need it to truly shine.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Master performer </span><span>and </span><span class="c2">Grand master performer</span><span>: These feats will grant you an augment of +1 per feat to one of your bardic performance. You should apply it to </span><span class="c5">inspire courage</span><span class="c0">, your bread and butter buff. They come from Pathfinder Society Faction Guide and are PFS legal. You should not have any problem convincing your DM letting you pick them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">6.2 CRB feats</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Combat casting</span><span class="c0">: concentration is a pain in the ass, this feat help you success more easily.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10">Defensive combat training</span><span class="c0">: it&#39;s useful only in the late levels, but it will give you a total +5 to your dmc (it&#39;s a lot).</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Dodge</span><span class="c0">: +1 AC is good, plus it unlocks many good feats.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Mobility</span><span>: AC is not your preferred layer of defence, but it will help you moving better through the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10">Wind stance</span><span class="c0">: same as before. But it will come online more later.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Lightning stance</span><span class="c0">: now we&#39;re talking. 50% miss is a lot! For the late levels.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10">Extra </span><span class="c4">performance</span><span>: bad, because you won&#39;t need it. But is a prerequisite for </span><span class="c5">master performer</span><span class="c0">; a necessary evil. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Improved familiar</span><span>: OH WAIT! Bards doesn&#39;t have familiars!!!!!!111oneone. Go read </span><span class="c5">eldrich heritage</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;feat.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Improved initiative</span><span class="c0">: how many times I have said that you need to act early? 5 star feat.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10">Shield focus</span><span class="c0">: you still don&#39;t know, but you will be carring a mithral buckler, so this is a +1 AC.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Skill focus</span><span>: with </span><span class="c5">versatile performance</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;it&#39;s 2 feats at the cost of one, so it&#39;s green. Anyway I do not think it will be useful.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10">Toughness</span><span class="c0">: better than a kick. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10">Weapon focus</span><span class="c0">: WTF I need this for?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Dazzling display</span><span class="c0">: for this. After the second/third round of fight you won&#39;t have much to do, so why not debuff your enemy? Remember: -2 to attack is equal to +2 AC, -2 to damage is equal to 2/- RD. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Quicken spell</span><span>: the only metamagic feat you will ever need. But you know what? Don&#39;t take it, buy a lesser rod instead (a Lesser rod will cover 1/2 of all your spells). Take it only if you think you will pick </span><span class="c2">spell perfection</span><span class="c0">. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">6.3 APG feats</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Breadth of experience</span><span class="c0">: +2 to 6/10 skills? Yes I want it.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Expanded arcana</span><span>: extra spell known are very good, but I do not think you will need to waste a feat on it until late levels. If you are human this feat become </span><span class="c10">yellow</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Extra traits</span><span>: One should be </span><span class="c5">magical lineage/metamagic master</span><span>. Or both :-P anyway use it on </span><span class="c5">Haste</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c12">Leaf singer</span><span class="c0">: bleah!</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Lingering performance</span><span>: You can read this feat like this: &quot;you will never run out of performance round&quot;. Unfortunately abusing it will prevent you from using your </span><span class="c5">finale</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;spells. So use it with wisdom.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Racial heritage</span><span class="c0">: this can unlock many nice things. On top of my head I can think human prankster :D</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Spell perfection</span><span>: One of the best feat in the game. If you spent </span><span class="c5">magical lineage </span><span>on </span><span class="c5">Haste </span><span class="c0">you can now cast it with a swift action without increasing its spell level.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">War singer</span><span>: I love it. Double range for </span><span class="c5">bardic performance</span><span class="c0">. Sadly only for stinky orcs :-( </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">6.4 UM feats</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Eldrich heritage</span><span>,</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;improved </span><span>and </span><span class="c2">greater</span><span>: you can do so much with this feats, and for you is very easy to qualify for. For maximum benefit take the</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Arcane bloodline</span><span>, take a familiar, take </span><span class="c5">improved familiar, </span><span>give him a wand of </span><span class="c5">Haste. </span><span class="c0">Profit.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Evolved familiar</span><span>: for early profit, give </span><span class="c5">skilled </span><span class="c0">evolution to your tiny friend. (+8 to any skill, in this case UMD).</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c12">Fire music</span><span class="c0">: Red like fire. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Spellsong</span><span class="c0">: I like it very much. It does two things. First protect you from prepared and opportunity attacks to disrupt your spells. Second you can maintain concentration on one spell and cast another. Juicy!</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10">Voice of the Sibyl</span><span>: not very good. It&#39;s better to take skill focus on perform skills you chose with </span><span class="c5">versatile performance</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">6.5 UC feats</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Discordant voice</span><span class="c0">: this is so good I&#39;d take it twice. Adds 3.5 damage to every attack made from your comrades every turn. No additional action required. This is your level 11 feat.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10">Harmonic </span><span class="c4">Sage</span><span>: can be decent for prankster or for bards that do not want to take </span><span class="c5">Lingering Performance.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Retorical Fluorish</span><span class="c0">: terrible prerequisite. If you look for something to improve your out of combat performance, this can help you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7">7.

When you get access to fly, it become useless. Only few points.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c12">Craft</span><span class="c0">: if you want to craft magic items choose spellcraft instead.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c12">Diplomacy</span><span class="c0">: you know already, don&#39;t you?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Disable device</span><span>: you do not have </span><span class="c5">trapfinding</span><span>, but, with all your buff, you will be able to disable every non magic trap you will came across.

Put here a point just to be sure.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Escape Artist</span><span>: For you it&#39;s the best way to escape a grapple in combo with </span><span class="c5">liberating command.</span><span>&nbsp;I prefer </span><span class="c5">freedom of movement </span><span class="c0">ring though. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c12">Fly</span><span class="c0">: don&#39;t ask.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c12">Handle Animal</span><span>: It&#39;s like </span><span class="c5">Mystic Theurge: </span><span class="c0">useless. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c12">Heal</span><span>: in doubt, </span><span class="c5">CLW. </span><span class="c0">Put 1 rank anyway plz.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c12">Intimidate</span><span class="c0">: please no. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Knowledge (arcana, dungeoneering, local, nature, planes, religion)</span><span class="c0">: welcome to legal metagaming. Put max rank in these. We need to know how to buff properly our comrades, we need to ask 1-2 questions about every enemy we will encounter in our travels.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10">Knowledge (engineering, geography, history, nobility)</span><span class="c0">: less useful, but these deserve 1 rank each.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Linguistic</span><span class="c0">: I like it. If you want to communicate, to read and to learn you need to know languages. Put ranks here until you reach a flat bonus of +20. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Perception</span><span class="c0">: The most rolled skill in the game, but I do not think it&#39;s your role to see things. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Perform</span><span>: Pure gold! 1) you will use it for your </span><span class="c5">bardic performance </span><span>2) you will use it with </span><span class="c5">versatile performance; </span><span class="c0">max rank in keyboard, sing and dance.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c12">Profession</span><span class="c0">: you&#39;re unenployed!</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10">Ride</span><span class="c0">: 1 rank.

It&#39;s funny and useful out of combat. You can do many things with a fast hand, if you know what I mean.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Spellcraft</span><span>: Very useful skill. Max it unless you have a wizard friend; in this case we can let him do something, so he does not feel like </span><span class="c9 c5">theurges.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Stealth</span><span class="c0">: shhhh!! I&#39;m stabbing you in your back!</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c12">Survival</span><span class="c0">: Put 1 rank and let the ranger pretends he know something. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10">Swim</span><span class="c0">: Try to put some rank, just to avoid drowning. Unless you have a beautiful friend you want to be reanimated by.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Use Magic Device</span><span>: Really cool. Get at least a bonus of +19, but I strongly suggest to max it out. Buy a lot of wands and scrolls (buy scrolls of situational spells!).

We will focus on augmenting our buffs and on being resilient.

The banner doubles the bonuses of </span><span class="c5">flagbearer; </span><span>give you +4 to initiative; make you reroll will saves every round; last but not the least if you are a bard you count 4 level higher for the purpose of </span><span class="c5">inspire courage. </span><span class="c0">A Must have for 18.000 gold. </span></p><p class="c6"><span>PRO TIP: always bring with you </span><span class="c2">+1 ghost touch net</span><span class="c0">.

If you haven&#39;t taken </span><span class="c5">lingering performance, harmonizing</span><span>&nbsp;armor is a priority. Actually, I prefer buying this enchant than to take the feat. </span><span class="c5">Fortification</span><span>&nbsp;protect you from nasty auto-crits, </span><span class="c5">determination </span><span>give you auto-ress, </span><span class="c5">slick </span><span class="c0">help you getting out from nasty grapples.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">8.3 Shield</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">+5 mithral buckler with the enchant you like more</span><span>.

I suggest to buy the former because is cheap and you can equip it before doing your big talk; choose the second one if you are a paranoid bastard (I&#39;ve become one inside Rappan Athuk), or the third if you prefer better mobility.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">8.11 Headband</span></p><p class="c6"><span>Guess what? </span><span class="c2">Headband of mental prowess+6</span><span class="c0">. By the way this is not a priority; while CHA and INT are your best stats, they do not help you very much buffing. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">8.12 Neck</span></p><p class="c6"><span>Want to be immune to gas and vapors?

The former it&#39;s a great layer of defence against necromantic powers and undeads; it saved my life many times. FoM it&#39;s one of the best effect you can have in your bard, but truth is you are going to fly. So imparing movement effect will be rare, and against grapple we have other defence. You can choose instead </span><span class="c2">ring of invisibility</span><span>&nbsp;or </span><span class="c2">ring of evasion</span><span class="c0">.

Use it well and you&#39;ll know everything! This is not a priority, but when you have spare golds buy it.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Broom of Flying</span><span class="c0">: I love it! Cheap way to fly around, advising your friends from above, far away from evil melees.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c11">9.

It will be more than enough to perform well. For Mr. Buffer to use spells in the right way it&rsquo;s a bit tricky: many of them will require you to be performing and many are casted with a swift/immediate action. In fact action economy and its management become a crucial part of your play style. I&rsquo;ll add more on this subject in the last part of this guide, for now I&rsquo;m going to mark all spell with a casting time of immediate action with </span><span class="c15">underline</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c14 c18"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">9.1 Level 1</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2 c15">Saving Finale</span><span>: Probably the level 1 spell you will use more. This will save your and your friends&#39; asses so many times. You have to hold your immediate action just to have the opportunity to reroll a crucial failed ST (I.E. </span><span class="c5">circle of death, insanity</span><span>)</span><span>.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Grease</span><span class="c0">: Great control spell. During the first levels of the game you won&rsquo;t have much to do, so enjoy yourself oiling the big axe of the stupid orc that is charging you. Or your female oracle friend ;-P</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Silent image: </span><span class="c0">One of the most useful spells in the game. Problem is many DM hate it.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c15 c4">Liberating Command</span><span class="c0">: Sometimes grapple screw your party hard. Sometimes you cast this spell. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c15 c4">Feather Fall</span><span class="c0">: CONGRATS! Your party has parachutes now!</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Vanish</span><span class="c0">: Significantly more weak than other invisibility spells, but much more cheaper! I like it!</span></p><p class="c6"><span>Bonus:</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span class="c15 c4">Windy Escape</span><span>: If you have this spell, you won&rsquo;t be hitten by a critical hit ever. OH WAIT! Neither sneak attack will work. So cast this spell and smile at the poor rogue crying (Only for Sylphs).</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">9.2 Level 2</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c15 c2">Gallant Inspiration</span><span class="c0">: Does your rogue friend failed a check to pick-pocket the king? Does the barbarian&rsquo;s hand slip over a wet rocks while he was climbing a cliff? this spell gives an average +5 to every skill check anyone fails. I do not think it&rsquo;s worth to waste a slot on failed attack though.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10">Ra</span><span class="c4">g</span><span class="c2">e</span><span>: This spell is </span><span class="c2">brilliant </span><span>if you have two melee </span><span class="c5">hammers</span><span>&nbsp;in your party. If you have one melee that is not a caster this is </span><span class="c4">decent</span><span>. If the only melee you have in the party is a clumsy magus, do not learn this spell. </span><span class="c2">PRO TIP</span><span>: rage, and all you other juicy morale bonuses you give can be improved by </span><span class="c5 c2">Courageous </span><span>weapons, PLUS it unlocks the option of a </span><span class="c5 c2">Furious </span><span class="c0">weapon, turning your pals into a pissed off Optimus Prime, more of this later!</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Glitterdust</span><span class="c0">: Both a buff and a debuff: it gives see invisibility to all you comrades and blindness is a nasty debuff.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Mirror Image</span><span class="c0">: Great personal defensive buff, it makes you virtually untouchable. You can swap it later when you start to fly around on your broom.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Versatile Weapon</span><span class="c0">: I prefer oils or scrolls of this spell in the early level, and later on wands. Anyway it can really resolve an encounter alone. When +5 weapon are available you can swap it. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Calm Emotion</span><span>: My party almost wipe cause a Confusion, mass; twice. Since that moment I learnt this spell. You should cast it and immediately dismiss it. So we use it like &ldquo;Dispel Confusion, mass&rdquo;. Please note that, while this spell suppress most of the listed effects, the text explicitly say &ldquo;</span><span class="c8">It also suppresses any fear effects and </span><span class="c2 c8">removes</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;(emphasis mine) the confused condition from all targets&rdquo;, and only the suppressed effects return when the spell is gone.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Delay Poison</span><span>&nbsp;&amp; </span><span class="c10">Delay Pain</span><span class="c0">: In the later levels, when you swap the previous listed spells, you can learn this two. You will also have enough slot to buff with them the weaker character of your gaming group.</span></p><p class="c6"><span>Honorable mention: </span><span class="c4">Silence</span><span>. Cast it on your fighter and let him melee the boss. Instantaneously the Balor is morphed into a T-rex with his short little (useless) hands! Profit!</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">9.3 Level 3</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Haste</span><span class="c0">: Fantastic. We all know haste, so what can I say more? It&rsquo;s the best buff of the game, it give you better to hit %, one extra attack, better mobility (effectively countering difficult terrain), +1 AC and Reflex.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c15 c2">Purging Finale</span><span class="c0">: It is a good way to countering debuff your enemy would throw at your party. It&rsquo;s pure gold because you do not need to waste any (almost) action.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">See Invisibility</span><span>: Take it and when you put your hands on </span><span class="c5">Eyes of the Dragon</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;swap it!</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Slow</span><span class="c0">: This is one of the few debuff you will learn. Slow shut-down enemies, great against numerous enemy parties.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Dispel Magic</span><span class="c0">: master of versatility, there are an uncountable number of situation where you can use this spell. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Feather Step, Mass</span><span>: read like: &ldquo;Counter difficult terrain, bitch&rdquo;. </span><span class="c5">Freedom of Movement</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is really better, in many ways, but this is cheaper and it targets multiple targets. learn it in the late levels.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10">Remove Curse</span><span class="c0">: curses are hard to be removed, and this spell has high chance of fail. However it&rsquo;s better a possibility more than one less. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">9.4 Level 4</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Virtuoso Performance</span><span>: Two bardic performance simultaneously? Yes please! Until you get </span><span class="c5">inspire heroics</span><span>&nbsp;go with </span><span class="c5">dirge of doom</span><span>+</span><span class="c5">inspire courage</span><span>. Later on you can combine the three performance thanks to </span><span class="c5">shadowbard</span><span>.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c15 c2">Heroic Finale</span><span>: Almost double </span><span class="c5">haste</span><span>? Probably </span><span class="c5">pounce </span><span class="c0">every round? this is gross and you should abuse it. If you need to make your allies pounce, you should use it soon, before they get to play. If you want them to break faces you should wait until the moment just before your next turn.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Song of Kyonin</span><span class="c0">: It is an hybrid between purging finale, infernal healing, mass CLW, all in a single spell. NOT BAD! </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Dimension Door</span><span class="c0">: Teleport is always appreciated, this is an utility and life-saver. You can bring others too, just remember: if you can, move before casting this spell.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Freedom of Movement</span><span class="c0">: Solid buff. Unfortunately this spell is single target and touch, so you can&rsquo;t really use it freely during combat, however the long duration mitigate this. If you bought the ring you can swap it. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Break Enchantment</span><span class="c0">: I like this spell very much, truth to be told. It dispel curses, enchantment, and transmutation 1 character/level. Sadly you can cast this spell only out of combat (or you can wait fifty rounds TROLOLOL).</span></p><p class="c6"><span>Honorable Mention:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Phantom Steed, Communal</span><span class="c0">: TERRIBLE SPELL, but I can&rsquo;t be helped: I love the idea of heroes arriving on the backs of multiple flaming phantom steeds! :D</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">9.5 Level 5</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Shadow Bard</span><span>: </span><span class="c5">virtuoso performance</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;on steroids. You do not use your rounds of performance, so you can keep 3 performance simultaniously. Perfect. Poor enemies!</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Song of discord</span><span class="c0">: I believe this is much better than Confusion, Mass. It transform enemies into allies! </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10">Shadow Walk</span><span class="c0">: From the buffer POV this is not great, but this is a good spell to have in your pocket. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10">Greater Heroism</span><span class="c0">: You should use it to counter fear and.... And.... I don&#39;t know. Fifth level spells are horrible! T.T</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c12">Stunning Finale</span><span>: very bad, i don&#39;t even know why It is in this guide! (Because fifth level spells are terrible, sigh!)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">9.6 Level 6</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Brillant inspiration</span><span>: reroll is one of the most powerful mechanic of the game. Buff your </span><span class="c5">hammers </span><span class="c0">with it and look as they eat enemies&#39; face.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Euphoric Tranquility</span><span class="c0">: Read like: &quot;touch your enemy and remove it from combat&quot;. If you pay attention you can use this spell to remove &nbsp;bigger danger from combat.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10">Waves of ecstasy</span><span class="c0">: minimum all enemies will be staggered for one turn. Maximum you win the fight. Not bad.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Animate Object</span><span>: bah, I do not like last level spells, but with this you can build a decent meat shield.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10">Geas/Quest</span><span class="c0">: passable spell with out of combat implications. Meh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c11">10. Masterpiece: &quot;Now be quiet, just... </span><span class="c11 c5 c17">Listen.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c17 c19 c5 c10 c20"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10">At the Heart of It All</span><span class="c0">: this masterpiece can be good out of combat for interaction with NPC.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c12">The Cat-Step</span><span>: I prefer </span><span class="c5">feather fall </span><span class="c0">&nbsp;:-/</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">The Dance of 23 Steps</span><span class="c0">: double combat expertise. You won&#39;t attack, and concentration DC it is very low. After early levels this could be a good choice.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10">The Depths of the Mountain</span><span>: </span><span class="c5">earthquake </span><span class="c0">is a good spell, 10 round of casting means, sadly, that you can use it only out of combat.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10">The Dumbshow of Garroc</span><span class="c0">: fireball for bards? Oh wait! It affects only plants and oozes :-(</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">The House of Imaginary Walls</span><span class="c0">: Walls are always useful, inside and out of combat. The ability to create them cheaply is invaluable.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Legato Piece of the Infernal Bargain</span><span>: I like very much these masterpiece cause it gives you option that normally bards won&#39;t get. Also </span><span class="c5">planar ally</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;it&#39;s a very interesting spell that can be used in infinite different ways.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">The Lullaby of the Ember the Ancient</span><span>: like the last two this is 1/2 </span><span class="c5">slumber, </span><span class="c0">so it&#39;s a nice option! </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Minuet of the Midnight Ivy</span><span class="c0">: this masterpiece gives you the ability to ignore difficult terrain and a climb speed. And you can share it with your friends! Great!</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10">The Quickening Pulse</span><span>: a DOT of 1d6/round..... That need your standard action? No. If you have </span><span class="c5">lingering performance </span><span>&nbsp;this is </span><span class="c4">green</span><span class="c0">, because with a standard action you can inflict good aoe damage!</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">The Requiem of the Fallen Priest-King</span><span>: Preemptively </span><span class="c5">heroic finale</span><span class="c0">. One of my favourite spell in a masterpiece for maximum action economy.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Stone Face</span><span>: new option for bards! Also </span><span class="c5">flesh to stone </span><span class="c0">is a fun spell: free food for all!!</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10">Toccata and Fugue of the Danse Macabre</span><span>: </span><span class="c5">hide from undead</span><span>&nbsp;it&#39;s not the most powerful spell, and you can obtain it from a very cheap </span><span class="c9 c5">ioun stone.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Triple Time</span><span class="c0">: for the cost of 1 round your base speed increase of 10 ft for 1 hour. Not bad.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10">The Winds of the Five Heavens</span><span class="c0">: it&#39;s good out of combat, but it&#39;s not what we are focusing on.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c14"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c14 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7">11. Tactics: wrap it all togheter!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Let&#39;s make a little recap now, before we start going crazy. </span></p><p class="c6"><span>We are going to build a </span><span class="c5 c2">core bard</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span>and choose </span><span class="c5 c2">aasimar emberkin</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span>as a race; we will use our alternate favored bonus to enhance </span><span class="c5 c2">inspire courage</span><span>&nbsp;till level 9, than </span><span class="c5 c2">inspire heroics</span><span>&nbsp;until level 19. Buffer will buy first </span><span class="c5 c2">banner of the ancient kings</span><span>, than a </span><span class="c5">resonating</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;armor. Our bard is going to take these feats:</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">1- Flagbearer</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">3- Extra Performance</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">5- Master Performer</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">7- Improved Initiative</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">9- Grand Master Performer</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">11- Discordant Voice</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">13- Skill Focus (any knowledge)</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">15- Eldrich Heritage</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">17- Improved Familiar</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">19- Toughness</span></p><p class="c6"><span>Later I&#39;m going to give you an example build, for now let&#39;s talk about strategy. Some raw numbers to begin: at level 9 you are going to buff your pals for +9 to attack (+4 inspire courage, +2 master performer and greater, +2 flagbearer and banner, +1 haste), +8 damage (+4 inspire courage, +2 master performer and greater, +2 flagbearer and banner), +30 ft movement speed, +1 attack at their max base attack bonus; this is only the BASIC buffs that came from </span><span class="c5 c2">banner</span><span class="c5">,</span><span class="c5 c2">&nbsp;inspire courage</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span>and</span><span class="c5 c2">&nbsp;haste</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">You can make your comrades reroll saving throws, you can save them from grapples, from fall damage and you can remove the following conditions: cowering, dazzled, fatigued, exhausted, nauseated, paralyzed, shaken, sickened, stunned; all without wasting actions.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;But let&#39;s start from the beginning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">11.1 Basic Strategy</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">You are looking at an initiative of 12 (+2 dex, +4 improved initiative, +4 banner, +2 reactionary), so I&#39;m assuming most of the fights Buffer will act first. </span></p><p class="c6"><span>Let&#39;s examine the case of a fight that starts with a surprise round in which Buffer can act. You have to choose between </span><span class="c5">inspire courage</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(IC) and casting a spell. You should sing, really. Then you have to pay attention to the battlefield: </span></p><p class="c6"><span>1) if your comrades act before enemies you should suggest them to move forward and (this is not valid in the case of giant monster with reach) stop 10 ft from enemies. If the enemies will come near your pals will have the first full attack. If the enemy decided to stay away don&#39;t worry. Before the round is completed use </span><span class="c5">heroic finale</span><span>&nbsp;(HF) to grant all your pals a bonus attack (btw I learnt that move+attack is very similar to a normal round) or a move action to engage melee. During the second round just go for </span><span class="c5">haste</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and stay ready to use one of your immediate spells. At the end of the round if you haven&#39;t use them you can unleash HF. </span></p><p class="c6"><span>2) If during the surprise round your people are very far away (more than 30 ft) from enemies you should cast </span><span class="c5">haste</span><span>, so they will have 60 ft movement and than HF. In the following round start IC and cast </span><span class="c5">Slow</span><span class="c0">. </span></p><p class="c6"><span>3) If you are facing a lot of enemies even casting </span><span class="c5">Slow</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;on the surprise round can be an option that will reduce preemptively the number of action the enemy party can perform; just remember to kill slowed enemies last. Follow with IC and haste. PRO TIP: the party that have access to more action will win the fights.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">4) If your damage dealers act after the enemies you can cast haste in your round, when the first enemies act use HF and give them 60ft movement to position better than enemies. You can also use a mirror strategy of the first advice I gave: if enemies come in melee you can use HF to give everyone a bonus attack or a move action.</span></p><p class="c6"><span>5) Last option is simpler: cast </span><span class="c5">song of kyonin</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;this is effective in encounters in which you expect constant damage. Pay attention: you can&rsquo;t use HF with this spell up.</span></p><p class="c6"><span>One third round just throw </span><span class="c5">slow</span><span>&nbsp;to your enemies, or really any debuff. Remember, every time you use a </span><span class="c5">Finale</span><span>&nbsp;spell you need to start again singing in the following round but not every istant spell breaks your performance. However, if there is not surprise round things are different, and you will really shine here. Here </span><span class="c5">Heroic finale </span><span class="c0">will be like pounce, if yours melees need to get near enemies, or a second haste if they are already in melee, to be more sintetic: you will unleash havoc. </span></p><p class="c6"><span>After level 10 when you unlock </span><span class="c5">virtuoso performance</span><span>, if you have enough performance round, you can stack </span><span class="c5">inspire courage</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c5">dirge of doom</span><span>. So 1st round IC and </span><span class="c5">haste; </span><span>2nd round </span><span class="c5">dirge of doom</span><span>&nbsp;or </span><span class="c5">slow</span><span>&nbsp;or any debuff. At level 11 you add 1d6 sonic damage to every attack performed by your friends. By level 15 you can grant your allies </span><span class="c5">inspire heroics </span><span>(IH), and you will count as level 18 for this performance: in the second round instead of </span><span class="c5">dirge of doom</span><span>&nbsp;you shoud use IH while in the following round you can choose between </span><span class="c5">dirge </span><span>or a debuff. Please note that </span><span class="c5">dirge </span><span>does not have a ST. At level 17 you will get a funny familiar, he&#39;ll be your </span><span class="c5">haste </span><span>man, also you will be able to buff 3 players with IH. Give your imp a wand e let him buff. So in the first round you will cast </span><span class="c5">shadowbard</span><span>, you will activate IC and IH, your imp will cast </span><span class="c5 c9">haste. OMG. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c5"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">11.2 Let&#39;s crunch some numbers</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">By level 1 buffer gives +2 attack, +2 damage, +1 ST vs fear.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Level 4 bring a little improvement: +3 atk, +3 dmg, +2 vs fear.</span></p><p class="c6"><span>At level 8 you should have </span><span class="c5">banner</span><span>&nbsp;and you will be able to cast </span><span class="c5">haste;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;our total buff will become: +6 atk, +5 dmg, +1 AC, +1 reflex, +4 vs fear, +1 extra attack.</span></p><p class="c6"><span>Level 12 bring us nice gift, both </span><span class="c5">Grand Master Performer, Discordant Voice</span><span class="c0">: +9 atk, +8+1d6 dmg, +1 AC, +1 rfx, +6 vs fear, +1 extra attack.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">At level 16 IH comes online: +9 atk, +8 +1d6 dmg, +5 AC, +4 fortitude and will, +6 vs fear, +5 rfx, +1 extra attack.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Level 20 does not bring anything new, just more targets aviable for IH and the imp for better action economy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">11.3 Teamwork</span></p><p class="c6"><span>Your melee friends should buy for their weapon the special abilities </span><span class="c5">furious </span><span>and </span><span class="c5">courageous</span><span>. This combo comes online when they have a </span><span class="c5">+2 furious, courageous weapon</span><span>: the </span><span class="c5">rage </span><span>spell alone buff them for +2 STR and CON morale bonuses, triggering </span><span class="c5">furious. </span><span>The weapon now it&#39;s a </span><span class="c5">+4 furious, courageous weapon</span><span>; </span><span class="c5">Courageous </span><span>increase morale bonuses by half the weapon enchant, in this case by 2, please remember that </span><span class="c5">flagbearer</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;gives morale bonuses, as well as IH; so your pals are getting by a single spell: +4 STR and COS, +4 to attack and damage; please note that these bonuses will stack with the others you give. Obviously if their weapons are at least +4 these buffs increase by one. Last but not the least this combo pump the weapons enchant bonus to +7, granting them the ability to overcome even epic DR.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">Cruel </span><span class="c0">is less effective, but if you focus on making enemies shaken it can amplify your debuffs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">11.4 Conclusions</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">I think this build is very viable and enjoyable. It&#39;s playable from level 1 and grows regularly through all levels. It&#39;s at 90% a support role, so not everyone can enjoy it. Also, in a party with only one &quot;hammer&quot; can be less useful; however in a party with archers, a master summoner or many &quot;hammers&quot; this is a blast. I strongly suggest to play Buffer to anyone tired of rolling for attacks and damage and to everyone that is looking for more strategical depth in the fights. </span></p><p class="c6"><span>I hope you enjoyed my guide, if you have any questions, comments or suggestions, please post on the messageboard.
