time I&rsquo;m looking at the warpriest. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a class that the guide writing community seems to have left behind. &nbsp;That doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s bad, far from it. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s actually a very nice class that helps fill a niche between paladin and cleric. &nbsp;Really between the two, I&rsquo;d say I like warpriest more than paladin due to the freedom of alignment and spell list. &nbsp;That and I really don&rsquo;t mind giving up smite for two extra levels of casting.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">For those of you asking about the theme, don&rsquo;t. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s my guide, not going to change it, don&rsquo;t argue. &nbsp;Really, it&rsquo;s a fun class that can be incredibly powerful (easily tier 3) with a lot of moving parts to it that can make it difficult to get the most out of it. &nbsp;But I&rsquo;m here to help you figure out how to be the best god hammer you can no matter what you&rsquo;re fighting. &nbsp;It can be complicated though, as you have a lot of feats to wade through, and there&rsquo;s so many directions you can take the class that it&rsquo;s good to go into it with a solid idea of what you want out of battle as well as less combat oriented situations. &nbsp;Make sure to look close at the roles when you&rsquo;re reading to get a firm handle on the kind of warpriest that you&rsquo;re looking to play here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">Once again, I&rsquo;ve got discussion threads on

class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><a id="id.97evrpfw4hw"></a><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c11">Thoughts</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">So what is a warpriest, you may ask? &nbsp;It&rsquo;s more fighting orientated than a cleric, but more casting orientated than a paladin. &nbsp;Really, it&rsquo;s one of the better hybrid classes to come out as it really feels like it works well with the spirit of both without being too redundant. &nbsp;In this respect, it&rsquo;s just a great class. &nbsp;It also has great use of the action economy with swift/free actions, something I&rsquo;ve always thought martial classes should be more adept at doing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Really, I think my only problem with the class is no custom spell list, as it really would have fit this class. &nbsp;Sure I know it&rsquo;d have been extra page space, but I think it would have been worth it. &nbsp;I mean we&rsquo;re already getting a great list to cast from, I would have just like some more care put into things. &nbsp;Even with that minor issue, a warpriest is great for those who aren&rsquo;t looking to have an alignment forced onto them but still want to trash things with the power of god.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">One of the biggest issues you&rsquo;ll face with the class is managing your action economy, as there is a LOT of things vying for your swift action. &nbsp;This isn&rsquo;t a bad thing, I actually really like it as it feels like it rewards strategic play, but you&rsquo;ll need to find out just when to use your actions each round in order to maximize your effectiveness, as without proper planning you&rsquo;ll be wasting actions that could have really buffed you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Really, you are a very powerful battle caster. &nbsp;But because of this, much like the magus, you run the risk of burning through all of your spells very quickly. &nbsp;Fervor can help you stack buffs, but always be mindful of how many spells you have, as you don&rsquo;t have the staying power of a full caster, so don&rsquo;t act like you do. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re not meant to be a primary caster, you&rsquo;re meant to be a burst damage beast.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Something that I really like about this class though is that it makes certain things that are thought to be dead into viable tactics due to their mechanics. &nbsp;Vital strike, cleave, and even thrown weapons are saved by a combination of scaling damage as well as early acquisition due to their bonus feats. &nbsp;If there&rsquo;s ever been a style of combat that you&rsquo;ve wanted to try out, there&rsquo;s a very good chance that you can make it work with a warpriest. &nbsp;Just check out the roles section and let me know what you think.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><a id="id.6umeveba9768"></a><p class="c6"><span class="c11 c3">Roles</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">There is seriously a lot of ways that you can play a warpriest, and thanks to new content and your bonus feats allowing you to snag some feats ahead of the curve, you can actually make certain styles viable that normally wouldn&rsquo;t have been. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s really worth looking over your options when picking a role, as there may be some that are viable that you never would have considered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Two Handed Fighting</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Pros</span><span class="c2">: Ah, the classic. &nbsp;Two weapon fighting as a focus is as viable as it&rsquo;s ever been, as the damage is nice and the feat selection is very relaxed. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s very easy to start on this path, all you really need is power attack to get it started. &nbsp;A very nice style for new players who want to just start off and learn things slowly instead of being bombarded by feat chains and other options, and offers some nice reach weapons.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Cons</span><span class="c2">: You won&rsquo;t really benefit much from your scaling damage as your weapon die sizes will most likely already be pretty beefy, and eventually you&rsquo;ll need to pick up another style, especially needing something for ranged.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Two Weapon Fighting</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Pros</span><span class="c2">: What makes this even more viable is the small damage dice of most light weapons being boosted by sacred weapon as well as being proficient in kukris. &nbsp;You can buzz saw through people and stack on the crit effects with critical mastery to debuff while you brutalize, making your damage look way nicer as well as having quite a few combos and other fun abilities to include.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Cons</span><span class="c5">: Normal two weapon fighting cons, like enchanting two weapons (or burning through 2x sacred weapon rounds) as well as your slower BAB making </span><span class="c5 c21">iterative attacks</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;come online slower does hurt this style somewhat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Vital Strike</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Pros</span><span class="c2">: Never thought I&rsquo;d be suggesting this, but with early access (for your BAB at least) you can actually work to make this more viable than ever before. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s a lot more feat support for vital strike, and it&rsquo;s still one of the most solid uses of a standard action as it helps you make even better use of the action economy, especially paired with things like travel&rsquo;s major blessing and other movement abilities.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Cons</span><span class="c2">: While better than before, it&rsquo;s still probably pulling in less damage than before, making this more of a &lsquo;mobility for damage&rsquo; trade off. &nbsp;Accuracy matters more here, but raw damage bumps help less.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Cleave</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Pros</span><span class="c5">:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Another style that seems impossible, but can work if you&rsquo;re often facing mobs. &nbsp;The action economy of cleave once you start adding feats to it is amazing and can let you step through entire battlefields in one round. &nbsp;Much like vital strike, it makes the boost to accuracy all the more valuable here and rewards you for hammering down on a field of scrubs.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Cons</span><span class="c2">: If you&rsquo;re often facing solo opponents, this role will suffer HARD as well as reducing your single target damage. &nbsp;Also the dumb racial prerequisites for some of your best feats. &nbsp;They are dumb.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Ranged</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Pros</span><span class="c2">: It&rsquo;s ranged combat, there&rsquo;s very little that&rsquo;s not good about it. &nbsp;With the amount of bonus feats you get and the ability to have fake BAB, you can take the most important feats you need when they&rsquo;re most valuable, granting you the prowess of a much higher level character at a lower level and making you competitive with others faster.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Cons</span><span class="c2">: It is pretty feat intensive, but you knew that going into this. &nbsp;For bows, you&rsquo;ll also need strength to boost your damage or else you&rsquo;ll be hitting pretty weak.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Thrown</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Pros</span><span class="c5">: Even thrown weapons are viable with the warpriest, although you&rsquo;ll probably need the marital focus feat so you can pick up ricochet toss to really get going. &nbsp;Throw in (PUN!) startoss style and you can really smash open some people, and it pairs great with vital strike thanks to your scaling damage. &nbsp;Two weapon fighting will up your attacks even more.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Cons</span><span class="c2">: Even with startoss, normal ranged is probably still more damaging due to its accuracy. &nbsp;And if you&rsquo;re two weapon tossing, same problems as normal two weapon fighting.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Switch Hitter</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Pros</span><span class="c2">: Switch hitting will probably be where you take two handed fighting, as with all of the feats you&rsquo;ll need a secondary focus eventually. &nbsp;Being a master of both bow and blade can be a lot of fun, or you can just skip the blade with empty quiver style. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll be a terror at close or far range and be able to dole out god&rsquo;s justice no matter where your enemies are coming from.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Cons</span><span class="c2">: This can be slightly feat intensive (especially picking up empty quiver) and requires good strength and dexterity, possibly limiting you to medium armor until later game to benefit from your full dex bonus.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Tank</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Pros</span><span class="c2">: With heavy armor, divine casting, and self healing, you can survive a lot. &nbsp;Throw in things like endurance and diehard and there&rsquo;s little you can&rsquo;t withstand. &nbsp;Once you toss in a shield and invest in your defenses (with swift action defensive cast buffs), you&rsquo;ll basically be a shield wall that can&rsquo;t be stopped, which means you can attend to those not so tanky.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Cons</span><span class="c2">: All this investment in your defenses will cut your offensive power quite a lot. &nbsp;Even more so if you go sword and board, so while it won&rsquo;t increase your AC, I&rsquo;d probably go dual shield style here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Finesse</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Pros</span><span class="c2">: Needing only 1 stat to attack and damage with is nice, making that stat dexterity is even nicer. &nbsp;Great AC, initiative, and reflex save among boosted skills help make finesse into a very viable style, keeping you acting first when needed and safe from danger at all times. &nbsp;Quite nice for a stealthier character too, and is a very cool visual. &nbsp;It also opens up ranged combat as a semi viable option aside from the needed feats.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Cons</span><span class="c2">: You probably won&rsquo;t be wearing heavy armor, and your damage will most likely end up lower than a two handed strength fighter, as well as a lack of reach weapons so you won&rsquo;t be an AOO monster.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c3 c14"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Caster</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Pros</span><span class="c2">: You still have 6th level casting and a pretty nice list to do it and a great reason to pump your wisdom sky high with fervor. &nbsp;While this should rarely be a main focus, picking up feats and abilities to help out with your casting can benefit you in the long run, changing you from just a beatstick into a problem solving hero of the party who&rsquo;s always got something to contribute.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Cons</span><span class="c2">: You don&rsquo;t have as many spells as a full caster, and buffing should be on your mind when you do cast. &nbsp;That and your bonus feats won&rsquo;t help much here, try not to focus too hard on this side of things.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c3 c14"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c3 c14"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c3 c14"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c3 c14"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Debilitator</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Pros</span><span class="c2">: Tons of blessings debuff and you have a spell list full of things to leave your opponents deaf, blind, and dumb before the end of the first round. &nbsp;With things like quicken blessing, spell storing weapons, and conductive, you can be sure that you&rsquo;ll have enough firepower to drop most opponents before they even think of messing with you or your party.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Cons</span><span class="c2">: This style can get resource intensive and requires more careful consideration of your actions, as you need to make sure you&rsquo;re keeping track of your debuffs properly and such.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Sneak</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Pros</span><span class="c2">: Your spell list isn&rsquo;t the best for this, but you do have some gems to help you play a far more sneaky character. &nbsp;Really it&rsquo;s exclusive to Mantis Assassin or Cult Leader, but both get some decent abilities to help hid you as well as getting some sneak attack dice to help hammer opponents who aren&rsquo;t as well protected as they thought they were.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Cons</span><span class="c2">: Most of your class features don&rsquo;t really help you be stealthy, so you&rsquo;ll need the archetype to make this work. &nbsp;Sneak attack is nice too, but it can be situational, even if built around.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Mounted</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Pros</span><span class="c2">: We&rsquo;ve already got an archetype that gives it so you&rsquo;re already set up to start wrecking people with your battle ready mount. &nbsp;Mounted offer a lot of options, as well as feats to pick up new mounts that&rsquo;ll even let you fly as well along with triple damage with lances off of that sweet scaling damage bonus of yours to make sure you destroy foes with spiral power.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Cons</span><span class="c2">: Divine Commander gives up quite a few bonus feats, meaning you&rsquo;ll mostly be picking up feats normally without a good favored class bonus, although share spells is very nice with a mount.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Demoralization</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Pros</span><span class="c2">: A more focused variant than the debuffer, this role instead focuses on intimidating and demoralization, as you have plenty of ways you can do it which range from cornugon smash or dazzling display optimization to demoralize even more foes and even buff your allies slightly in the process. &nbsp;With feats like hurtful, you&rsquo;re even landing more damage to drop those scaredy cats faster.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Cons:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Fear is sometimes resisted and with your con, you&rsquo;ll need intimidating presence to make this that viable, so you&rsquo;ll need to watch what you&rsquo;re trying to intimidate to make sure you can.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Reach</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Pros</span><span class="c5">: With all martial weapons comes &nbsp;a very nice collection of reach weapons. &nbsp;Picking up combat reflexes is enough to make this variant of the two hander build solid, but with </span><span class="c0">righteous might</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;on your spell list (albeit rather late), you can eventually make a massive bulwark of defensive power, crossing strong defense with battlefield control to become a titan of the slayground.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Cons</span><span class="c5">: Your 3/4ths BAB will make this style harder, and you will probably need to invest in things like improved trip and such to keep opponents from moving. &nbsp;That and </span><span class="c0">righteous might</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;comes in rather late sadly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Healer</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Pros</span><span class="c2">: This shouldn&rsquo;t be a main role, but it&rsquo;s something you can easily focus on along with other roles, making it a decent secondary focus. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ve got a full list of cure spells (and good spells can spontaneously cast them) as well as fervor as an emergency recovery option as well as channel energy for cure energy. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s not an ideal use of your time, but with status removal spells too, you&rsquo;re a solid band aid box.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Cons</span><span class="c2">: Using fervor to heal, especially heal people who aren&rsquo;t you, is the worst way to use it. &nbsp;You also don&rsquo;t have a cleric&rsquo;s number of spells, so you&rsquo;ll be healing a lot less than a dedicated healer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Bad Touch</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Pros</span><span class="c2">: Making one attack into a debilitating mess of status conditions, this is a more specialized form of debilitator that can cripple opponents with a single strike and leave them ready for casters in the party clean up or even your own spells to finish the job. &nbsp;With the right investment (Cleric or Witch VMC is almost mandatory), you can leave an opponent in shattered pieces after only a single strike, forcing tons of saves and brutal conditions</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Cons</span><span class="c2">: You&rsquo;ll need to VMC cleric or witch to do this as well as spend feats to accomplish it, making it a considerably feat intensive style. &nbsp;You also should be picking certain domains that might not be giving the best blessings either, so deity choice can get even more complicated if you&rsquo;re going VMC cleric.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c9 c3"><a class="c10" href="#id.j6xrvirzxh">Return to Table of Content</a></span></p><p class="c1"><span

class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Your ability scores are pretty mutable here, it really depends on how you want to attack as both ranged and melee are entirely viable, as is strength or dexterity builds. &nbsp;Get a firm handle on what you want to build before picking out your stats to help you build the best god smasher you can.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c11 c3">Ability Scores</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Stren</span><span class="c3 c8">gth</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c4">(****</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c8">**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;For most of you, you&rsquo;ll be swinging for the fences unless you&rsquo;re going ranged. &nbsp;Power is always important, and it&rsquo;s good to keep your accuracy and damage as high as possible.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Dexte</span><span class="c3 c8">rity</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c4">(****</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c8">**)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">And on the other side of the attacking spectrum, dexterity is always good to have, making ranged a very viable option. &nbsp;Heavy armor melee types don&rsquo;t need it nearly as much though.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Constitution (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You need to be able to take a hit as a front liner, and even ranged characters can&rsquo;t depend on a d8 hit die to save their lives, making this a solid stat to boost.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Intelligence (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Yeah, you don&rsquo;t need to be smart, although with only 2 skill points a level, it couldn&rsquo;t hurt.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Wisdom (****)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Your casting stat, although a lot of spells you&rsquo;ll be casting will be self buff. &nbsp;It does affect the amount of fervor you gain (you like fervor) and your blessing&rsquo;s DCs, so it&rsquo;s probably your 1st or 2nd most important ability score. &nbsp;Keep it high and focus on boosting it when you can.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Charisma (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Like most classes, you don&rsquo;t need to be pretty, you just need to be good.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><a id="kix.1xlg161mxgdw"></a><p class="c6"><span class="c11 c3">Races</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c17">Core</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Dwarf (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Oh man, these are GREAT warpriest! &nbsp;Bonuses in the perfect places, great racial abilities, and a solid favored class bonus and great racial feats for a cleaving warpriest, you&rsquo;d think they were custom made.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Elf (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;There&rsquo;s very little here that&rsquo;s actually useful, not a fan of the elves.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Gnome (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Nothing here is really that special, but small size doesn&rsquo;t hurt their weapon damage as much which is really nice. &nbsp;A strength penalty means they should be going ranged, but aside from that, they&rsquo;re okay.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Half Elf (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;With variable stats as well as a possible free exotic weapon for atheist warpriest, half elves are solid workers with a decent favored class bonus and good racial abilities.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c16">Half Orc (*****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Considering that you&rsquo;re going to be taking sacred tattoo, this race has a ton of synergy with warpriest and can steal the human favored class bonus, making them some intense warpriest. &nbsp;Throw in strong racial feats and the ability to snag racial heritage and they&rsquo;re the best CRB race possible.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Halfing</span><span class="c5 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c8">(**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Aside from a ranged warpriest, this is a pretty hard sell. &nbsp;Small size helps as always, but all other racials aren&rsquo;t really great for what we&rsquo;re trying to do here.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Human (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;When aren&rsquo;t humans great? &nbsp;Solid favored class bonus, mutable ability bonus, and an extra feat help you start off feat chains early as well as a nice favored class bonus to really push you into them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c17">Featured</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Aasimar (***)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;/ </span><span class="c3 c4">Archon</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c4">Garudablooded (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Base aasimar is already pretty solid, with a wisdom bonus and some nice throw ins, but archon/gardua give you great bonuses for either a general or ranged warpriest, making for an even more impressive (and thematic) warrior of god.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Catfolk (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Bonuses to things we barely need and penalties to our main ability score? &nbsp;Nah.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Dhampir (*)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;/ </span><span class="c3 c8">Nospheratuborn (**)</span><span class="c5 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">While the base Dhampir is trash, Nospheratuborn get passable racials for a melee warpriest, but the con penalty is a hard hit to take.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Drow</span><span class="c5 c12">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c12">(*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Slightly worse ability adjustments than elves, slightly better racial abilities, still not great.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Fetchling (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While having terrible ability adjustments, their racial abilities are just really good.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Goblin (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;As long as you&rsquo;re not looking for strength, you can get by quite well with a goblin, as a +4 to dex is a huge boost as well as taking oversized ears for a really good perception boost.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Hobgoblin (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Amazing ability adjustments here, and while the racial abilities aren&rsquo;t great, they&rsquo;re not terrible, making these big buff goblins a good call.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Ifrit (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Red like fire, these aren&rsquo;t great for warpriest.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Kobold (*)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Are kobolds good for anything?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Orc (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While a +4 to strength is nice, the wisdom penalty is a hard hit, half orcs are generally a better call here. &nbsp;Only for those obsessed with strength.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Oread (***)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Great ability adjustments for a melee warpriest, but the rest of the racial abilities are lacking.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Ratfolk (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Nothing here is what you want.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Sylph (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Another sub par elemental race.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Tengu</span><span class="c5 c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c4">(****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While the con penalty hurts, everything else here is great. &nbsp;A natural attack routine can be easily used with an alternative racial ability, and sword trained opens up some very nice weapons.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Tiefling (***)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;/ </span><span class="c3 c4">Asura</span><span class="c5 c4">/</span><span class="c3 c4">Demodand</span><span class="c5 c4">/</span><span class="c3 c4">Devil</span><span class="c5 c4">/</span><span class="c3 c4">Onispawn (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The base tiefling is okay, but man does it get intense when you take alternative racials, as you can pick out quite a few great ones. &nbsp;Having a tail can help out a lot too, and the other racial abilities can be very nice.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Undine (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Consider these the dexterity oreads for their placement, as great ability adjustments are paired with very boring racial abilities once again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c17">Uncommon</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c16">Duergar (*****)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Basically better dwarves, straight upgrade aside from alternative racial abilities.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Grippli</span><span class="c5 c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c4">(****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Great racial adjustments, small size, and decent enough racial abilities make these frogs pretty solid, and a net is a decent weapon to be proficient with for opening attacks.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Kitsune (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Mixed bag racial adjustments but cool racial abilities, that isn&rsquo;t enough to make them great.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c16">Kasatha (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Amazing for multi weapon fighting with great racials, they are unfair.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c16">Lizardfolk (*****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Amazing racial adjustments for melee as well as 3 pnatural attacks and +2 natural armor makes them amazing tanks as well as brutal in melee, although I&rsquo;d take weapon focus for both claws and bite.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Merfolk (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While their racial adjustments are okay, the natural armor pushes them up a bit, although you will need to take the alternative racial ability to up their speed or else be basically immobile.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c16">Munvari (*****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Silly broken.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Orang-pendaks (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;An okay race with nice racials, but not much else. &nbsp;While I like them being small, I like small mounted races, and this race isn&rsquo;t meant for mounted combat.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Reptoid (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Basically a slightly better kitsune for transformation focused warpriest.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Samsaran (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;We&rsquo;re really only here to poach spells from the paladin list, plain and simple. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a solid race to do that, although the con penalty isn&rsquo;t great. &nbsp;Awesome for more casting focused warpriest though.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Syrinx (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Basically just a more melee focused strix.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Skinwalker (****)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;/ </span><span class="c3 c4">Werebear</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c4">Wereboar</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c4">Wereshark</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c4">Werewolf</span><span class="c5 c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c4">(****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Skinwalkers by default are quite solid, but these other variants of them are just as good (sometimes less intelligent though) with abilities ready for you to customize to your heart&rsquo;s content and a ton of nice traits too.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Strix (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Inbuilt flight is amazing, full stop. &nbsp;The racials don&rsquo;t hurt you either, so feel free to fly.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c16">Svirfneblin (*****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;There are unfair, don&rsquo;t pick them.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Wyvaran (****)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s an upgraded strix, but that&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s a dragon.</span></p><a id="kix.ewmskb4yrcdy"></a><p class="c6"><span class="c11 c3">Traits</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">I&rsquo;ll be

especially for ranged types.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Kin Guardian (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A nice boost for swift aid, but you have to be related.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Monk Weapon Skill (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Even better than heavy hitter, as your weapon selection is way better.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Reactionary (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;All initiative boosters are great, full stop.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Reckless (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Acrobatics is pretty fun to have, but not vital.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Equipment</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Heirloom Weapon (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While not the powerhouse it was, a +2 on a combat maneuver is hard to turn down if you&rsquo;re focusing on them, it&rsquo;s basically a feat, but you&rsquo;ll need masterwork transformation here to stay relevant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Faith</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Birthmark

your go to buffing spell with a solid duration effectively making it your in battle buff of choice, and this buffs it. &nbsp;Throw in things like Jingasa of the Fortunate Soldier for extra AC and the

this.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Sacred Touch (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Not very helpful, but a cool little trick that&rsquo;s pretty fun.</span></p><p class="c1"><span

buffs earlier.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Magical Knack (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;If you plan on multiclassing, you need this, full stop.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Magical Lineage (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;I really like this with whatever buff spell you most enjoyed paired with extend spell, basically doubling the duration all the time. &nbsp;Really helpful for self buffs.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Spark of Creation (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re the party&rsquo;s crafter discounts are always nice.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Stabbing Spells (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;If you plan on casting against enemies, getting through SR is important.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Two-World Magic (***)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;I&rsquo;m always a sucker for getting </span><span class="c0">prestidigitation</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;on my spell list.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Racial</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Big Ears (***)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(Goblin)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Bonuses to perception are great, and hearing is very important. &nbsp;It actually opens up using a dog whistle to communicate as well, making it even better.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Boar Resilience (***)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(Wereboar)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The initial benefit isn&rsquo;t that great, but being able to skip needing endurance for all of those cool feats that need diehard is very nice.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Bred for War (****)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(Human)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The CMB bonus by itself is very nice, and an intimidate boost is just icing.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Chain Master (***)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(Tiefling)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Another boost to tripping with whips, a beautiful thing.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Deadeye (***)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(Half-Orc)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This time it&rsquo;s a sight perception bonus, which are generally more common.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Deathtouched (***)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(Any)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The real boost here is +2 vs. mind affecting effects which are game enders.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Enduring Spellcraft (***) </span><span class="c3">(Human)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Since you&rsquo;re buffing yourself a lot, increasing your duration is good.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Favored Champion (***)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(Human)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Rerolling a failed CMB check can change the flow of combat, although once a day does hurt. &nbsp;Still, for a trait a reroll is golden.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Fiery Glare (***)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(Ifrit)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Taking 10 on intimidate can help make intimidation go far more smoothly once you&rsquo;ve already pumped it up high enough.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Finish the Fight (****)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(Half-Orc)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This will almost always be in effect unless you&rsquo;re a tank or ranged.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Helpful (***)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(Halfling)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re using bodyguard, this is a nice bump too, don&rsquo;t think it stacks with swift aid though, at least from what I&rsquo;ve read sadly.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Inheritor (***)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(Gillman)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;For aid builds, this is another boost, and an untyped boost too.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Shield Bearer (****)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(Human)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A damage bonus for shields is a sold buff and a neat little 1/day power too.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Tusked (**)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(Orc)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A free bite attack, it&rsquo;ll probably be secondary, but damage is damage.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Weapon Training (***)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(Human)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is a very nice list of weapons to get +1 damage with.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Regional</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c16">Ancestral Weapon (*****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Free masterwork weapon made of a special material, accuracy bonus with it and all other weapons made of that material? &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re wielding a melee weapon, TAKE THIS!</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Awakened from Stasis (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Needing only 2 hours of sleep is nice for crafters and those with obediences.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Briar Bandit (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;For sneak attackers, every little bit of extra damage helps.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Community Minded (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You can get this bonus on some of your blessing and spells, making this nice.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Cunning Liar (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;If you want to bluff, being able to base it off of wisdom is intense.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Dominator (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Intimidate builds will need this, it&rsquo;s yet another buff to being scary.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Forbidden Knowledge (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This effectively gives you equal ranks in knowledge (the planes) as long as you invest in knowledge (religion), something you should be doing anyways.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Freedom Fighter (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;If all you want is diplomacy, here&rsquo;s the best possible boost to it.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Glory of Old (****)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(Dwarf)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Boosting your saves is always strong, combo it with iron soul for max defense.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Heavy Hitter (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Great for those going unarmed, free damage without requirement</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Linebreaker (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;For those of you charging, extra distance will definitely help.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Metamagic Master (****)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Same with magical lineage, but slightly more restricted. &nbsp;Make sure to be smart about which you take if you&rsquo;re taking both, as this pairs better with </span><span class="c0">divine favor</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;than lineage does.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">River Rat (***)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">And here&rsquo;s a buff to dagger damage, not a bad call for a sacred weapon.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Slave Taker (**)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">A nice bump if you&rsquo;re dealing nonlethal damage.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Whip Specialist (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;For whip wielders, this is another nice damage buff.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Religion</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Bestial Wrath (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A +2 to crit confirms is nice for crit fishers.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Blade of Mercy (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is amazing for subdual artist, avoiding the normal problems with subdual.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Defensive Strategist (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A slightly janky uncanny dodge is easily worth a trait.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c16">Second Chance (*****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Literally a free reroll on a save once a day, that&rsquo;s better than some feats.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Propagation (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A +2 bonus to intimidate is the real treasure here.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Secret Knowledge (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Probably the best way to add a knowledge skill to your list.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Shield Trained (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Due to sacred weapon, dual wielding heavy shields won&rsquo;t help you out anymore than just wielding light shields as well as removing weapon finesse as an option and occupying your hand.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Wisdom in the Flesh (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Swapping a dex skill to wisdom is pure beauty, and it&rsquo;ll help you make sure that even if you don&rsquo;t have the best dex you can be sneaky or disarm or anything like that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c3 c14"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Social</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Adopted (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Go steal someone else&rsquo;s race trait, it&rsquo;s fun!</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Memorable (****)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Demoralizers want this, it&rsquo;s a free extra round of demoralization.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Drawbacks</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Anxious (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re not a face, this probably won&rsquo;t mean much, and it lets you pull off a very nice &lsquo;speak softly can carry a big stick&rsquo; persona. &nbsp;And it lets shy players stay away from the spotlight if they want.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Attached (****)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Not a bad drawback and pairs great with heirloom/ancestral weapon.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Fey Taken (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Doesn&rsquo;t this just pair beautifully with fey foundling?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Foul Brand (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;For evil warpriest, this is just awesome if you&rsquo;re already on the way of the wicked.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Headstrong (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Good if you really want to push your religion onto people.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Meticulous (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Not exactly great for flavor, but a strong choice for a general drawback.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Naive (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Now this could be fun to play around with, much like how anxious plays into your character.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Overprotective (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Great for a tanky character who&rsquo;s always trying to keep everyone on their feet.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Power Hungry (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;There&rsquo;s a lot of campaign potential in someone playing this well.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Pride (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This one could be hilarious to play out at the table.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Umbral Unmasking (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;No shadow is just cool, and it can play out in a ton of different ways.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c16">Warded Against Nature (*****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;I seriously consider this a benefit, as well as a cool chance for roleplay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span

feed on the innocent, the pure, the clean, and the beautiful. &nbsp;These are what you should fear, child. &nbsp;And that includes me.&rdquo; Clover Hyst, enforcer of the Black One</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c11 c3">Class Features</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Spellcasting</span><span class="c5 c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c4">(****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You&rsquo;re casting off the the cleric list, that list is awesome. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ve got a great mix of buffs, healing, status removal, and all sorts of other good stuff. &nbsp;While you don&rsquo;t have lowered spell levels for important spells (meaning some things aren&rsquo;t vastly level appropriate for you), you cast better than most and your casting is actually synchronized with your class features, making you a certified battle caster.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Blessings (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;One of the first things that helps separate you from your parent classes, blessing are neat little abilities that help you out in random ways. &nbsp;They&rsquo;re basically your domain abilities, and like domain abilities, they can end up vastly different in levels of quality.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Aura (?)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Nothing much to judge here, it&rsquo;s your standard holy class feature, it&rsquo;s cool, just not really relevant.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Focus Weapon (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;In and of itself, this is just a bonus feat. &nbsp;A decent one, but a bonus feat nonetheless.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Sacred Weapon (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Now here&rsquo;s where focus weapon becomes awesome. &nbsp;Sacred weapon makes so many weapons viable that it&rsquo;s just mind boggling. &nbsp;Whip builds, star knife builds, all those goofy weapons you wanted to use but couldn&rsquo;t are here for the taking with increasing scaling damage. &nbsp;While you&rsquo;re need to pick up an exotic with your feats or racials, this is an amazing ability that also gives you an in built magic weapon to give you something else to spend your gold on, truly a great ability for a martial.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Bonus Languages (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Yay, more languages...I guess. &nbsp;Good for talking to your summons, at least.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c16">Fervor (*****)</span><span class="c5 c12">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Swift action casting is basically the best thing ever, anyone who&rsquo;s ever taken quicken spell will tell you that. &nbsp;You can buff yourself in a monster without stopping your combat flow, making you a beast that can&rsquo;t be stopped with great use of the action economy. &nbsp;And to add to that, you can even heal yourself with it as a swift action (or others as a standard), meaning you&rsquo;re even more unstoppable. &nbsp;This is probably your coolest and best feature as a warpriest, although it will also be the thing that teaches you how to ration your swift actions. &nbsp;Slightly worse for evil characters due to no self healing, but still amazing as hell.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Bonus Feats</span><span class="c5 c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c4">(****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;We&rsquo;re sitting even better than fighter feats with faux BAB and faux fighter levels which works out great for getting feat trees as well as picking up other things you need.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Channel Energy (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While it&rsquo;s an option (and some variant channels can be fun), two uses of fervor is a steep price to pay for how good that ability is, so I can&rsquo;t see using this all too often. &nbsp;Still, options are never bad.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Sacred Armor (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This comes a little late, but it&rsquo;s another cash saver, making the warpriest a very nice class for low gold games. &nbsp;While the bonuses you add aren&rsquo;t all that great, adding straight bonuses to AC as well as situational (at least daily so) energy resistance.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Aspect of War (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A once a day super buff is cool on paper, but meh in execution. &nbsp;Not terrible, but really I don&rsquo;t mind it since the class itself is so great, and this capstone will rarely come into play.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><a id="id.g43q6k1uthxo"></a><p class="c6"><span class="c11 c3 c14 c18 c20">Skills</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Sadly you don&rsquo;t get a lot of skill points, so you&rsquo;re going to have to dedicate them to what you really need, so basically perception and something else. &nbsp;You do have a decent enough set of class skills, but you&rsquo;ll need some investment in intelligence in order to really make them shine.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c15 c14 c17">Class Skills</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Climb (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While sometimes you&rsquo;ll need to climb, this isn&rsquo;t something you need to invest in after a while.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Craft (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a fun downtime skill, but except for one archetype, you won&rsquo;t be needing it much.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Diplomacy (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Sadly, you&rsquo;ll probably be tanking your charisma. &nbsp;Even still, it&rsquo;s good to be able to talk to people without sounding like an idiot, and investing in diplomacy will keep your foot out of your mouth.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Handle Animal (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You don&rsquo;t have much of a reason to have an animal aside from one archetype, but if you are going that way, this will help keep your magic horse happy.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Heal (*)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Most other classes kind of need this, you absolutely don&rsquo;t. &nbsp;Only good if it&rsquo;s required for something.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Intimidate (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Despite your lacking charisma, there are some builds that work well with a high intimidate check, so it&rsquo;s worth looking to see if that&rsquo;s something you want to do, as intimidate builds are solid.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Knowledge (Engineering) (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A cool skill, but rarely useful.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Knowledge (Religion) (***)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Now this will come up a lot more, you need to know who you serve, right?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Profession (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Unlike craft, no archetype needs this, give it a pass.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Ride (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Again if you have a mount it&rsquo;s useful, never terrible to invest in this skill.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Sense Motive (***)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Social perception, this plus your wisdom score should make you into a lie detector.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c17">Non Class Skills</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Bluff (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Bluffing can be okay, diplomacy&rsquo;s probably better, but you&rsquo;ll need it if you plan on feinting.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Fly (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Not actually super vital, invest enough to make easy fly DCs and then let it go.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c16">Perception (*****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Most rolled skill in the game, you&rsquo;re a wisdom based class, not a hard call here.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Sleight of Hand (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A neat trick for most, you&rsquo;ll need this if you&rsquo;re looking to sneak.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Stealth (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;For a dex based character, I always love pumping stealth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span

&nbsp;There&rsquo;s quite a few of them that aren&rsquo;t worth your time, although almost all of them are made better by the quicken blessing feat. &nbsp;Some of them are only viable with said feat, at least in my very informed and heroic opinion. &nbsp;Remember that you can trade out minor and major blessings for </span><span class="c9 c5"><a class="c10" href="#id.gzdjrr8207fr">divine fighting

always good, and while the duration isn&rsquo;t amazing, being able to pull the ability to fly out of your back pocket can save lives. &nbsp;That and the charge damage is a nice little bonus

never unarmed.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Battle Companion (***)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;A 1 minute </span><span class="c0">nature&rsquo;s ally</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;isn&rsquo;t bad, and it&rsquo;s about where you should be now spell level wise. &nbsp;Nothing to depend on, but free flanking and a few decent attacks from it should help out in battle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Artifice</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Crafter&rsquo;s Wrath (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Being able to bypass hardness for a minute can prove quite useful in a pinch, and while you won&rsquo;t pull it out all the time, it can be used to great effect when you do.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Transfer Magic (*)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Switching a +1 or +2 bonus won&rsquo;t likely swing things, and to even do this you already require 2 magic weapons. &nbsp;The target needing to be willing really weakens this, as stealing abilities would be cool.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Chaos</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Anarchistic Strike (*)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Lawful enemies aren&rsquo;t common in most games, making this very situational.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Battle Companion (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a summon below the level you&rsquo;d expect by now and chaos has a pretty weak list for what it can summon, generally meaning you&rsquo;ll be getting a templated creature. &nbsp;Meh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Charm</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Charming Presence (**)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Sanctuary</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;is a nice spell, but it&rsquo;s solidly defensive, and you&rsquo;re more an offensive character. &nbsp;Spending time to use it onto another party member is a round you&rsquo;re not smashing faces.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Dominance Aura (**) </span><span class="c2">Another fight for your swift action, and really, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a great use of it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Community</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Communal Aid (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Assuming you&rsquo;re using aid another abuse (swift aid feat, fools for friends trait), this can be quite amazing, since aiding is an awesome use of an action. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Fight as One (***)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">While not the best use of an action, if your party is having problems hitting something, focusing fire with a bonus like this is a decent use of your action.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Darkness</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Enshrouding Darkness (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Concealment is really nice, although some foes will eventually see through it.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Darkened Vision (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Blind is a powerful condition. &nbsp;You could do this with spells, but it&rsquo;s nice as a blessing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Death</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">From the Grave (*)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Looking spooky and some minor defensive buffs are just kind of boring.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Death&rsquo;s Touch (***)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Negative levels are nice, but the duration and needing a touch attack reduce the value here. &nbsp;Still, the value of negative levels are high enough to make this worth checking out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Destruction</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Destructive Attacks (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Now this is a very solid damage boost, and easy to apply as well.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Heart of Carnage (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Bonuses to confirmation are really meh, but moderate fortification isn&rsquo;t bad at all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Earth</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Acid Blessing (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;1d4 extra acid damage is okay. &nbsp;Nothing amazing, just...okay.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Armor of Earth (**)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">The lack of stacking here really pulls it down for me, as DR 1/- at 10th level is painfully small, and it scales too slowly for me to consider it a viable option.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Evil</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Unholy Strike (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;In any game where you&rsquo;d take this, it&rsquo;s only okay.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Battle Companion (***)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Evil monsters are plentiful in the </span><span class="c0">Summon Monster </span><span class="c2">list, so you&rsquo;ll generally have something decent to bring along, even if it&rsquo;s slightly underleveled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Fire</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Fire Strike (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Fire&rsquo;s often resisted, don&rsquo;t bank on it.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Aura of Flame (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;See previous statement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Glory</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Glorious Presence (**)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s just charming presence.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Demoralizing Glory (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Basically just a feat, nothing amazing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Good</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Good Strike (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Evil foes are the most likely, so it&rsquo;s a 1d6 buff against most evil monsters, not a bad buff.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Battle Companion (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Good also has a solid list of monsters, although not as good as evil&rsquo;s.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Healing</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Powerful Healer (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This suffers from the warpriest not getting higher level healing spells, but for healing effects, this is one that will help extend your spell budget when it comes to healing.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Fast Healing (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s basically 30 hp for a blessing, not a terrible exchange at all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Knowledge</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Lore Keeper (*)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">This is only useful if you&rsquo;re not willing to burn traits to grab a knowledge skill.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Monster Lore (**)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">While a +2 attack bonus is nice, needing a knowledge check first limits the usefulness.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Law</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Axiomatic Strike (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Chaos isn&rsquo;t too common a type, again making this situational.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Battle Companion (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Same problems with chaos, the list of monsters they have isn&rsquo;t great.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Liberation</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Liberation (***)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;A slightly janky </span><span class="c0">Freedom of Movement</span><span class="c2">, but that spell is awesome, making this nice too.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Freedom&rsquo;s Shout (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Somewhat worse, but still a decent use of an action.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Luck</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Lucky Presence (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A free reroll can be vital, although the duration makes this a good bit weaker.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Unlucky Enemy (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While being adjacent isn&rsquo;t great, it basically prevents you from being crit and lets you force opponents to save twice against your abilities.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Madness</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Madness Supremacy (**)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Sure it lets you act, but your options are limited and possibly involve hurting yourself which isn&rsquo;t what you want to do in life.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Control Madness (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Now this is a lot better, as it turns confusion into an incredibly viable control tactic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Magic</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Hand of the Acolyte (***)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">A cool blessing that&rsquo;ll help give some range to melee warpriest.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Blessed Magic (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;I want to like this more, but all the restrictions on it make it hard to enjoy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Nobility</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Inspiring Word (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A small but decent buff, comparable to a 1st level spell or so.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Lead by Example (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The duration weakens this one, but +4 attack is a huge bonus.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Plant</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Creeping Vines (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While the duration isn&rsquo;t great (nor giving a save), the action economy of this blessing is pretty nice since you&rsquo;re not burning a standard action for it.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Battle Companion (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Same as animal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Protection</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Increased Defense (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is a small bonus, but it will stack with a lot of things other than spells and applies to both AC and saves, making it very useful early.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Aura of Protection (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is still quite a lot of energy resistance at this point in the game, and considering it&rsquo;s against 5 different types and continues to get better is just amazing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Repose</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Gentle Rest (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This really needs a set up to be amazing as the duration is too short against everything but undead. &nbsp;Works well if paired with another way of staggering like with quicken blessing for 2 touch attacks.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Back to the Grave (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;In battle channeling isn&rsquo;t great, but if you&rsquo;re already doing it, might as well throw in some small damage to the undead while you&rsquo;re at it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Rune</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Blast Rune (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is a tricky little thing that it feels like has always been related to runes. &nbsp;The damage and difficulty to use really hold this back, making it a fun trick, but nothing to build around.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Spell Storing Weapon (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Spell storing is great for your action economy, and the duration of this is amazing, making it easily usable pre battle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Scalykind</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Scaly Touch (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The scaling bonus is decent although the duration isn&rsquo;t great.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Serpent Fant (***)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">The poison here is decent and the DC can be pretty solid since it scales, and even the frequency keeps it relevant, although the actual poison damage is low enough to bring it down.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Shadow</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Flicker of Shadows (**)</span><span class="c13 c5 c22">&nbsp;Shield bonuses aren&rsquo;t too common, although ignoring cover can be solid. &nbsp;For only 1 attack though, this isn&rsquo;t really strong enough.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Swift as Shadows (***)</span><span class="c5 c22">&nbsp;The swift action activation is what saves this, as difficult terrain and a speed boost is a solid package for a blessing.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Strength</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Strength Surge (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A decent attack buff later on, the duration of this is just too short to depend on it.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Strength of Will (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;So basically armor training, not really that impressive.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Sun</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Blinding Strike (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;With a short duration, this isn&rsquo;t too impressive. &nbsp;At least blinding is a good deuff.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Cleansing Fire (**)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Undead bane is nice, but not enough to carry this blessing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Travel</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Agile Feet (**)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">The duration kills this, but being able to ignore magical terrain issues is strong.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Dimension Hop (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Keeping mobile around the battlefield is very powerful, and being able to attack or cast afterwards can be quite powerful. &nbsp;Great for getting out of bad situations.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Trickery</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Double (**)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">I want to like this more, but the action required as well as the short duration make this a hard sell, even if it is a good defensive tool. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Greater Invisibility (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;One round of invisibility means you have to unload on it when you get the chance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Void</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Airless Touch (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Way too short a duration, basically just anti caster for a round.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Deny Gravity (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Same as air.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">War</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">War Mind (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A variable bonus that last a minute is really nice even if the bonus is small.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Battle Lust (***)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">This is really only worth it if used on someone who can&rsquo;t take nonlethal damage, as then it&rsquo;s a straight 2d6 damage buff. &nbsp;Otherwise, it&rsquo;s a dangerous blessing to use.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Water</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Ice Strike (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Cold isn&rsquo;t a bad damage type to do, but the damage being done here is pretty small.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Armor of Ice (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This just doesn&rsquo;t feel like a good late game blessing to me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Weather</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Storm Strike (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Last elemental strike, same review.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Wind Barrier (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;So you&rsquo;re basically immune to mundane ranged attacks and it doesn&rsquo;t affect your own ranged attacks? &nbsp;This is amazing for ranged warpriest.</span></p><p

that boost skill checks as its singular focus. &nbsp;You can get enough magical items and such that&rsquo;ll do this, and feats are more precious than that.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Agile Maneuvers (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;For those of you going the finesse route, this is a strong option. &nbsp;Everyone else doesn&rsquo;t really need it, although it&rsquo;s okay for ranged builds using thrown weapons too.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Alignment Channel (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While you can channel, you really shouldn&rsquo;t most of the times, making this meh.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Augment Summoning (***)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;For those of you with battle companion, buffing your companion can help keep it relevant, but due to your slowed progression, normal </span><span class="c0">summon monster</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;spells are pretty weak for you.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Blind Fight (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A situational feat, you shouldn&rsquo;t be swinging against invisible creatures often.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Catch Off Guard</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c8">Throw Anything</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c8">Improvised Weapon Mastery (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You&rsquo;re proficient with all martial weapons, you shouldn&rsquo;t need this.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Channel Smite (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is a decent damage bump against undead (or living) creatures, although taking two uses of fervor is a HEAVY price to pay for this, making it situational at best.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Combat Casting (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Keeping your spells going is important, but you have ways to avoid needing concentration checks, so it&rsquo;s up to if you see yourself casting in melee a lot.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Combat Expertise (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;I hate this feat a lot, and now it&rsquo;s made irrelevant by another feat. &nbsp;Only pick this up if you&rsquo;re looking for stalwart abuse.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Improved</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c12">Greater Disarm (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This isn&rsquo;t even generally a good combat maneuver, skip it.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Improved</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c8">Greater Feint (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;As long as you&rsquo;re a cult leader, you can use this somewhat. &nbsp;Most people can skip over it though as feinting isn&rsquo;t generally worth the effort or investment.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Improved</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c7">Greater Trip (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Tripping is always good, and eventually you can get big to keep it relevant, something most other martials aren&rsquo;t great at doing.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Combat Reflexes</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c12">Stand Still</span><span class="c3 c7">&nbsp;(***)</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c12">(*)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Again, our ability to grow large keeps this relevant, and with the variety of weapons you can use to help exploit this further, this could easily help cement some builds. &nbsp;Stand Still is trash though, just trip people instead.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Command Undead (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You&rsquo;re not much of a necromancer, but it is a cool trick to pull out.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Craft Wondrous Item (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Item crafting is always great, and it&rsquo;s always something nice to have.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Critical Focus</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c7">Blinding, Exhausting, Sickening, Staggering, Tiring Critical (***)</span><span class="c5 c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">With a pair of high crit weapons, you can absolutely destroy someone with crits, and being able to land debuffs with them is awesome. &nbsp;Staggering can even help set up with repose&rsquo;s blessing too, although the feats not listed aren&rsquo;t worth your time.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Critical Mastery (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re going to crit fish, you might aswell do it well.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Deadly Aim (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is your damage maker for ranged attacking. &nbsp;While the accuracy penalty hurts, you have a few ways to up your accuracy normally, making it less of an issue for you.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Defensive Combat Training (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You should be pretty good on CMD, but if not, this is a slight boost.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Disruptive</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c8">Spellbreaker (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;An interesting pair of feats, good for following step abuse, but not much else.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Dodge</span><span class="c5 c8">/</span><span class="c3 c12">Mobility</span><span class="c5 c12">/</span><span class="c3 c12">Spring Attack</span><span class="c5 c12">/</span><span

class="c3 c12">(*)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Dodge is just okay, not a great feat, but okay. &nbsp;The rest aren&rsquo;t leading anywhere good though, they can be easily skipped.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Elemental Channel (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Think alignment channel, but worse.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Endurance</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c7">Diehard</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c12">(*)</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c7">(***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Endurance is a feat tax here (one half orcs can get racially), but diehard is a solid feat for keeping you standing for a round (also great since you probably traded ferocity), and with fervor you can put yourself back at positive hit points easily, making you even more tanky.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Exotic Weapon Proficiency (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;For most people, this is only okay. &nbsp;But in the hands of a warpriest, you can make any exotic weapon into a terror. &nbsp;The biggest problem is the BAB requirement, which means you can&rsquo;t take it with your first level weapon focus (unless you retrain), making this a stronger option for races with different weapon proficiencies or bonus feats at first level.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Extend Spell (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t like a lot of metamagic, but for just one slot higher you can keep your buffs running longer, and your buffs are of vital importance.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Extra Channeling (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;If you want to channel, do it like this. &nbsp;Two uses isn&rsquo;t terrible.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Improved Channel (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t channel offensively unless you&rsquo;re using variant channeling.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Improved Critical (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A great feat even without others supporting it, increasing your crit range can change just how viable a weapon can be in the right hands. &nbsp;Even better with scaling damage, too!</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Improved Initiative (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Going first can be vital, and it lets you dictate the flow of the fight.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Improved Unarmed Strike (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is another situation where your scaling damage becomes very impressive, especially for Sacred Fist. &nbsp;Unarmed strikes also open up style feats to you as well, giving you even more options that&rsquo;ll help you develop an even more interesting style.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Deflect Arrows</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c7">Snatch Arrows</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c7">(***)</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c7">(***)</span><span class="c5 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Blocking a ranged attack per round can be nice, especially at lower levels, and getting a free attack with snatch by throwing something back is basically free damage.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Improved</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c8">Greater Grapple (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Me personally, I&rsquo;m not big on grappling, so this is a pretty unimpressive combat maneuver to me. &nbsp;Others might be able to use it well, but it&rsquo;s only okay on a warpriest.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Scorpion Style</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c8">Gorgon&rsquo;s Fist</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c4">Medusa&rsquo;s Wrath</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c7">(***)</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c8">(**)</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c4">(****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;At early levels, getting in only a single attack isn&rsquo;t bad and the speed reduction is quite nice. &nbsp;Gorgon&rsquo;s fist is basically a weak upgrade to this, but even a round of staggering isn&rsquo;t bad (combos nicely with repose&rsquo;s blessing). &nbsp;The real payoff is Medusa, as landing one of these conditions (quickened repose blessing) increases your damage by a TON.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Improved Shield Bash</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c7">Shield Slam</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c4">Shield Master</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c7">(***)</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c4">(****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;I&rsquo;d really only consider this if you&rsquo;re dual wielding shields (which to me seems awesome), but shield slam up against a wall is a free trip attempt, and shield master makes this just silly good.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Intimidating Prowess (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is just okay unless you&rsquo;re going for an intimidation build, in which case you&rsquo;ll probably end up needing this. &nbsp;Still takes a small hit from your presumably abysmal Charisma though.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Leadership (?)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;If you can take this, do. &nbsp;If not, don&rsquo;t.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Lighting Reflexes, Improved (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Your only weak save, it&rsquo;s generally not too important to pass these.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Lunge (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Increasing your reach for only -2 AC is a steal, and it makes some weapons even more impressive.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Metamagic Feats (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Most other metamagic feats aren&rsquo;t worth your limited spell slots, give them a pass.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Mounted Combat</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c7">Mounted Archery</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c7">Ride By Attack</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c4">Spirited Charge</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c8">Trample</span><span

class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c8">(**)</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c12">(*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Mounted combat is quite useful for warpriest (even if I&rsquo;m not a huge fan of the archetype for it), but it can get quite feat intensive. You&rsquo;re going to have to dedicate if you&rsquo;re going to make it work, but lance warpriest can get straight brutal. &nbsp;Trample is a nice throw in, but nothing you really need, and unseat is just too specific for most encounters.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Nimble Moves</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c8">Acrobatic Steps (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Positioning is important to you, so it depends on if you face difficult terrain often or not. &nbsp;Acrobatic is a nice step up, especially since some warpriest will have reduced speeds.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Point-Blank Shot (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Decent by itself, but it&rsquo;s the prereq for a LOT of good feats.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Precise Shot, Improved (****) </span><span class="c2">Accuracy boost are always great, and cover will ruin your day a lot, so it&rsquo;s good to get around these penalties with these feats.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Rapid Shot (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;An extra shot is always worth it, even with the penalty to attack.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c16">Manyshot (*****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A bonus shot for literally nothing, you NEED this.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Penetrating Strike, Greater (**)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;These come too late to be of much use and eat your bonus feats, meh.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Power Attack (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You don&rsquo;t have quite the accuracy to make this mandatory, but you should be able to use this to great effect, especially for two handers.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Cleave, Greater (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;At early levels, cleave is a great tool for melee to squeeze in a bit more damage, and very useful for reach weapons. &nbsp;The greater version can really help clear out mobs as well.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Improved Bull Rush, Greater (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Another situational positioning ability.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Improved Overrun, Greater (**)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s okay for positioning, but meh.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Improved Sunder, Greater (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Why break your loot?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Quick Draw (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Since you can draw as a move action, not really needed unless your GM is very strict on drawing weapons and such.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Rapid Reload (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;There&rsquo;s not a ton of great weapons for you that need this, although it&rsquo;s mandatory if you&rsquo;re somehow wielding a weapon that does need reloaded.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Selective Channeling (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re going to battle channel, you&rsquo;re going to need this to keep your party from hating you for &lsquo;friendly fire&rsquo; channeling.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Shield Focus, Greater (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re going shield style, it&rsquo;s not bad, but it&rsquo;s basically dodge.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Spell Focus, Greater (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While you can target others with your spells, you&rsquo;re not as much of an offensive caster, so this is more up to playstyle than anything else.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Spell Penetration, Greater (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;See above, but to a greater extent.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Step Up (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Following an opponent who&rsquo;s trying to cast in front of you can make you that much more dangerous, and it has lead up feats that&rsquo;ll help it out too.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Toughness (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While you don&rsquo;t have the best hit points, you can self heal and smash faces, so only consider this if you&rsquo;re feeling like you need more HP if you&rsquo;re front lining.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Turn Undead (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Situational but decent, it&rsquo;s another tool if you want more ways to mess with undead.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Two Weapon Fighting, Improved,</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c7">Greater,</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c8">Defense</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c8">Double Slice</span><span

class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c8">(**)</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c7">(***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Two weapon fighting is brutal for a warpriest with their scaling damage, and while accuracy is a concern, you have quite a few ways to buff yourself in battle. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re getting less of a return on greater, and really defense and double slice are throw ins, as the additional damage from double slice isn&rsquo;t nearly that large. &nbsp;Rend is a nice ad on though, and it&rsquo;d be worth taking double slice for it.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Vital Strike, Improved, Greater (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Even with scaling damage, it doesn&rsquo;t scale high enough to make this viable, although early entry into it can make it better if you&rsquo;re using large weapons. &nbsp;You can try to build around this with greater weapon of the chosen though, but you&rsquo;ll need a large weapon to do that.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Weapon Finesse (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You&rsquo;ll know if your build needs this, it can completely make builds by itself.</span></p><p class="c6"><span

c8">(**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While the +1 is nice, the real bonus here is getting more sacred weapons. &nbsp;The greater version doesn&rsquo;t provide the same benefit, making it mostly an accuracy boost</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Weapon Specialization, Greater (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Extra damage is nice, but you&rsquo;ll need your bonus feats for these, and I feel like your bonus feats have better options than this.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Dazzling Display </span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c7">Shatter Defenses</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c8">(**)</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c7">(***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Dazzling is basically filler, shatter

pick up with this class, check them out!</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Bashing Finish (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While shields don&rsquo;t have the best crit rate, it&rsquo;s another possible attack with your shield, so consider upping your crit range to take advantage of this.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Bloody Assault (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Your accuracy isn&rsquo;t worth piddly bleed damage.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Bodyguard</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c7">In Harm&rsquo;s Way (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;With community&rsquo;s blessing, this can be a big boost in AC, and you&rsquo;re tanky enough to take this for others with self healing, so it&rsquo;s worth considering for tanks.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Cocatrice Strike (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While cool to turn someone to stone, you should be turning them to powder with your attacks, so this is really just not a good use of your actions.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Combat Patrol (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While not terrible, your BAB doesn&rsquo;t increase fast enough to validate this feat.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Crippling Critical (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A decent use of your critical feat, lowering mobility can be helpful.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Dazing Assault (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While better for full BAB types, you don&rsquo;t have the BAB to make the save for this worth it.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Eldritch Claws (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Warpriest are one of the few martial classes I don&rsquo;t like with natural attacks, and this doesn&rsquo;t help them enough to make them viable.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Enforcer (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The discount cornugon smash, this is acceptable if you aren&rsquo;t allowed softcover books.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Following Step</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c7">Step up and Strike</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c8">(**)</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c7">(***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Following step is weak, it&rsquo;s basically a prereq feat, but step up is a very nice follow up, helping to close the gap and pile on damage.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Furious Focus (**)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Unless you&rsquo;re working off of vital strike, this won&rsquo;t buff you too much. &nbsp;If you are, it&rsquo;s nice.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Go Unnoticed (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A sneaky little feat, being able to fade into battle can help you set up in a better position.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Heroic Defiance</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c12">Recovery</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c4">(****)</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c12">(*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Defiance can make or break you, ESPECIALLY with your swift action casting to be able to cure yourself of a condition or protect yourself from it. &nbsp;Recovery though...bad.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Improved Dirty Trick, Greater (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Dirty Tricks are a solid debuff, they&rsquo;re worth investing in.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Improved Drag, Greater (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is a combat trick that just isn&rsquo;t worth the time.</span></p><p class="c6"><span

of you with mounts or familiars, this is a nice way to split your buffs.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Improved Steal, Greater (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You could just kill someone and take their stuff.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Improved Stonecutting</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c7">Stone Sense</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c12">(*)</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c7">(***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;No one cares how well you identify stone, but tremorsense is very powerful, and even 10 ft of it is worth considering.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Keen Scent (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Having scent is also powerful, and lets you take advantage of pheromone arrows.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Ki Throw (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re already a tripper, being able to position a foe into another space can be really useful for positioning to help you and your allies beat on them all together.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Point Blank Master (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Probably the only reason to pick up weapon specialization, it lets you stay safe in melee range even when you&rsquo;re unwilling to drop your bow.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Racial Heritage (***)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(Human)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You need to be human (or part human) to take this, but it lets you steal some of those awesome

class="c2">This isn&rsquo;t worth your swift/immediate action.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Second Chance (**)</span><span class="c5 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">This can be okay

can be brutal.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Advanced (***)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Being nauseated is rough, but a one round duration isn&rsquo;t amazing. &nbsp;Still a solid effect though.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Greatsword Battler</span><span class="c13 c3 c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Initial (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Basically mandatory for those of you trying to use vital strike, this increases your mobility and allows for a hell of a huge AOO when it counts. &nbsp;Shame vital strike comes online so late though.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Advanced (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This will wreck up a caster&rsquo;s day, but won&rsquo;t do much against non casters.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Inspiring Sword</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Initial (**)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s a nice bonus, but it&rsquo;s a tad too short to be that useful, especially with your 3/4ths BAB.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Advanced (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;For a charge attack, you give a great buff for a solid duration, this is inspiring!</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Poisoned Lash</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Initial (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Poisoning isn&rsquo;t great. &nbsp;This doesn&rsquo;t make it good.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Advanced (*)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">See above.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">-Item Mastery Feats-</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Compulsory Mastery (***)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Considering you don&rsquo;t normally have access to it, it&rsquo;s a nice piece of subterfuge.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Curse Mastery (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You do have access to this, but a curse is a long term debuff, so it&rsquo;s not terrible.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Dispel Mastery (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Same as above, but if you&rsquo;re using the dispel feats, this is another dispel option.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Energy Mastery (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You have better ways to do damage than this.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Flight Mastery (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Flying isn&rsquo;t bad, but the limited duration of this makes it more meh.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Illusion Mastery (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;I have a soft spot for illusions, and you can pick this up pretty early too.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Telekinesis Mastery (**)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">While a powerful spell, the short duration really hurts this.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Teleportation Mastery (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;I&rsquo;d rather just use travel blessing myself.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Vision Mastery (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;I like this as just a little trick, the choice between the two spells is quite helpful here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span

class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c4">(****) </span><span class="c2">Starting with an interesting style, ascetic style lets you get in touch with your inner monk. &nbsp;Strike is basically worthless since you&rsquo;re a warpriest, but form comes back and gives us some great feats to play with like perfect form.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Dwarven Hated Style</span><span

c8">Torrent (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a fun line up, but the intelligence focus doesn&rsquo;t really work for you. &nbsp;torrent would be nice without it, but warpriest shouldn&rsquo;t be using combat expertise anyways.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Empty Quiver Style</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c7">Flexibility</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c7">Flurry (***)</span><span class="c5 c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Turn your ranged weapons into melee, why don&rsquo;t ya? &nbsp;This will give you around as

Mastery Feats-</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Ace Disarm (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Cool, I&rsquo;ll never use this.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Ace Trip (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Being able to &lsquo;trip&rsquo; fliers is a huge boost, helps keep your whole team in the fight.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Burrowing Shot (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;An untyped -2 to attacks and saves? &nbsp;Wow, that&rsquo;s pretty damn good. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Cut from the Air</span><span

c8">(**)</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c4">(****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Cut from the air shouldn&rsquo;t have this requirement, but it&rsquo;s good regardless. &nbsp;Smash, less so, as these are more uncommon projectiles. &nbsp;Spellcut is the main reason to take it, as the idea of cutting magic is just beautiful, especially with your poor reflex save.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Devastating Assault (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;With a full BAB this would be nice for you, but you don&rsquo;t make enough attacks to make this a valid option. &nbsp;It&rsquo;d be better using a double weapon.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Difficult Shot (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This doesn&rsquo;t create difficult terrain in the places it needs to in order to be great.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Marksman&rsquo;s Utility</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c8">Finesse Shot (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Neat little tricks, but that&rsquo;s all they are. &nbsp;You have magic, act like it.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Retributive Kick (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;So it&rsquo;s basically only for early game, not a great use of feats.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Ricochet Toss (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This singlehandedly makes ranged attack with non ammunition worthwhile. &nbsp;Savor it.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Weapon Material Mastery (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While nothing is amazing here, it does give you reason to golf bag it once again, and thanks to your sacred weapon, you can throw enchantment bonuses onto all your weapons.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Weapon Style Mastery (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Styles are always good to double up on.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Orc Fury Style</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c8">Orc Rampage</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c8">Orc Snarl (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;More of a hard intimidation style, the prereqs and existence of cornugon smash make this style on

Style</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c7">Tactician</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c7">Vortex (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Very close to blue, early entry into

class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c8">Spiral (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;More switching grip and getting a double weapon, nothing great here.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Startoss Style</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c7">Shower</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c7">Comet (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A pretty solid style for vital strikers and for the scaling damage that warpriest get with their weapons, combos great with ricochet shot.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">-Weapon Tricks-</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">One Handed</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Free Hand Maneuver (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;We can&rsquo;t fake a BAB for this, meaning it comes in late enough for us to have picked up quick dirty trick, a much better feat.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Mindful Dodger (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;+4 AC to 1 attack for being staggers? &nbsp;Nah.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Seize and Strike (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Even as a standard action, this is weak.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Stylish Riposte (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A free attack for being a tank is really what we want, although the limit of once per day lowers the value somewhat. &nbsp;Still, free attacks are always good.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Polearm</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Choke up (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A damage and accuracy penalty for something like this isn&rsquo;t great, pretty situation.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Close Sweep (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Now here&rsquo;s a good trick, close range tripping can help set up opponents for death.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Half Bash (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;So a slightly different choke up?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Polearm Balance (**)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Another situational ability, I don&rsquo;t make many balance checks myself.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Quick Brace (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While you&rsquo;re probably swinging poorly, it is a chance to land a strong hit. &nbsp;Oddly better for you than full BAB types due to the 3/4ths BAB.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Ranged Weapons</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Hindering Shot (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While I don&rsquo;t like making less attacks, a -4 is a big hit, it&rsquo;s worth the reduction if your ally is trying to land an encounter ending affect on them.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Suppressing Shot (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Now this isn&rsquo;t as good; I like protecting, but not at the cost of a full round attack.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Two Handed</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Cleaving Smash (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;If you want to mix cleave and vital strike styles, this is the way to do it.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Crush Armor (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While a nice debuff, I hate needing to break armor, so it&rsquo;s up to you what you smash.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Two Handed Menace (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s nice not to have to roll for something some of the times.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Warding Weapon (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Total defense is a total waste of your time.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Two Weapon</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Arm Bind (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;If the target couldn&rsquo;t so easily free themselves, this might be a lot better.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Dual Strike (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This would be awesome...if not for the prereqs. &nbsp;WHY?!</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Off Hand Opportunity (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Generally two weapon fighting isn&rsquo;t very AOO heavy.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Piercing Climb (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Effectively a climb speed, but if you&rsquo;re land bound it isn&rsquo;t terrible.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Weapon and Shield</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Confounding Shield (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Sword and board isn&rsquo;t big on feinting, but the next trick helps it out.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Feint and Bash (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t love the prereqs, but with two weapon feint, this could be decent.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Shielded View (*)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Encounter many gaze attacks? &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Warded Movement (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While fun and sneaky, the once per day really hurts this trick.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c3 c14"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c3 c14"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c3

c8">Accomplished Sneak Attacker (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While your sneak attack is nice, you don&rsquo;t need to focus on boosting it too much, as you do decent damage already. &nbsp;Good if you&rsquo;re focusing around it though.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">All-Consuming Swing (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While it might seem nice, the damage you&rsquo;ll take will outpace the value of it quickly.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Blessed Hammer (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;For bad touch, this is a late and specific way to use a weapon instead of unarmed.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Butterfly Sting (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The classic, a two weapon fighter high crit attacker setting up a powerful 4x crit.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Cornugon Smash (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is how you demoralize.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Cunning Caster (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While the prereq is trash, you have a few spells that will be great with this.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Deific Obedience (?)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Rather than trying to explain these all, I&rsquo;m going to link to </span><span class="c9 c3"><a class="c10"

guide to them.</a></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Destroy Identity (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While not the strongest, charisma damage can put someone into a coma and you literally just beat someone ugly, the staggering is icing on top.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Dirty Fighting (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re going to go for combat maneuvers, this is how you do it.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Drunken Brawler (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;By itself, this is only okay. &nbsp;But with the blade and tankard style, you could constantly be refreshing these temporary hit points, making you an amazing drunk tank.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Expanded Knowledge (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Having more spells you can treat as class spells for magic items can keep you from needing to rely on UMD when it counts.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Familiar Bound, Improved (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Familiars are awesome, and a brawler familiar could really help you out, especially with things like share spells. &nbsp;Needing iron will isn&rsquo;t great, but it&rsquo;s a bonus and so is this.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Feinting Flurry, </span><span class="c3 c8">Improved</span><span class="c3 c7">&nbsp;(***)</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c8">(**) </span><span class="c2">Basically two weapon feint for flurry, improved is meh.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Fencing Grace (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Your other dex to damage feat.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Fury&rsquo;s Fall</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c7">Snare</span><span class="c3 c8">&nbsp;(**)</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c7">(***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Most of the time your dex will only be about a +2/+3 for this, but entangling while prone can be VERY nice. &nbsp;It risk breaking your whip, so I&rsquo;d carry a spare if you want to use this.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Fey Foundling (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;So you&rsquo;re an orphan, at least you get healed better which is always awesome.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Hellcat Stealth</span><span class="c5 c4">/</span><span class="c3 c8">Pounce</span><span class="c3 c4">&nbsp;(****)</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c8">(**)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Being able to hide in bright light (even at a penalty) can make you painfully hard to find. &nbsp;Pounce isn&rsquo;t really your thing unless you&rsquo;re a zealot or cult leader.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Hurtful (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Another swift action requirement, but it&rsquo;s a free swing, couples great with cornugon smash.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Indomitable Mount (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Your ride check will almost certainly be better than your saves.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Jaguar Pounce (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;An easy way for whips or charge builds to get improved critical early, but less reliable than taking the real thing. &nbsp; I&rsquo;d probably trade it once you qualify, but it&rsquo;s great for early game.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Lob Shot (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;For throwers, cover can be a real pain, this&rsquo;ll help you get past wall spells.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Measured Response (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;For your bigger damage dice, this will do okay damage, but I like risking it more.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Monstrous Mount, Mastery (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Divine Commander ony, but getting a flying mount makes you so much more mobile. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll need mastery to fly with it though, which while annoying isn&rsquo;t terrible.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Motivating Display (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;For sneakers using shatter defenses, giving a buff to allies in the same action as you demoralize can help your friends out a lot.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Mountain-Splitting Strike (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Having your unarmed strikes count for large size combos amazingly with pummeling charge, amping up your damage by a good amount, even better for small warpriest.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Mounted Blade (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;For mounted chargers, this is basically a slightly worse cleave.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Nature Soul</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c4">Animal Ally</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c4">Boon Companion (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;With all your bonus feats, it isn&rsquo;t hard for you to snag an animal companion, although you&rsquo;ll need boon to bring it up to full power.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Necromantic Affinity (**)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;For evil warpriest, this will let you self heal a lot easier.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Piranha Strike (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s power attack for light weapons, less damage overall but still bonus damage.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Ranged Disarm (*)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">A full round action? &nbsp;Really?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Ranged Trip (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Tripping at a range is quite nice, although this gets weak fast once you start getting more attacks. &nbsp;It deals damage though which helps it stay relevant longer.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Reckless Aim (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Most opponents will be engaged in melee after the first round, so taking an AC penalty and a minor risk to allies is worth a +2 to hit.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Roll with it (****)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">(Goblin)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;An amazing damage sponging maneuver, best for ranged characters but helps you be a much better bouncy tank if you optimize for unfair levels of acrobatic. &nbsp;Sadly, it does take an immediate action which will make it less viable for you.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Totem Spirit (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;There&rsquo;s a few nice bonuses here with moon, hawk, or wind clan.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">To the Last (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A worse deathless initiate, but doesn&rsquo;t require half orc.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Undersized Mount (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Mounts are hard to use because of their size, this fixes that.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Violent Display (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While it takes your swift action to do, a swift action dazzling display is a lot better than what you&rsquo;d normally need to activate it.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Weapon Versatility (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Dealing different damage types is nice when trying to get through DR.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Wheeling Charge (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re going for charges, keeping your charge lane open is vitally important.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c9 c3"><a class="c10" href="#id.j6xrvirzxh">Return to Table of Content</a></span></p><a

hierophant of the Soul Blood faith</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Magic is a lot different for you than it is for a normal cleric, as you get a lot less of it, but the way you can interact with your spells is also quite different. &nbsp;You have different considerations, and single target self buffing is a lot more important for you due to the speed at which you can accomplish it. &nbsp;Due to reasons like this, you have to be smarter when selecting your spells to make sure they&rsquo;ll be useful no matter the situation.</span></p><p

nothing that huge.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Create Water (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Good for basic survival or just being clever, having water is always nice.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Detect Magic (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A good utility spell, it&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;ll probably use every so often.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Detect Poison (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;More situational, poison isn&rsquo;t a big thing, but good if you&rsquo;re paranoid.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Guidance (***)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A neat little buff, but nothing to depend on, not worth a swiftcast though.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Light (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Always a good thing to have, and useful if you&rsquo;re creative.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Mending (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Especially good if you&rsquo;re always breaking your gear, it has its uses.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Purify Food and Drink (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;More useful than detect poison, a nice thing to do before every meal.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Read Magic (***)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Not as important for you as it is for a wizard, it&rsquo;s still solid for scrolls and such.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Resistance (***)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A nice little boost until you get a cloak of resistance, try and keep it up when you can.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Spark (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;I&rsquo;d say slightly worse than light, it still has its uses if you need a quick fire.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Stabilize (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Just heal them, this is a last ditch effort to keep someone alive.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Virtue (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Temporary hit points are nice, but this one is too low.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c3 c14"></span></p><a id="id.7eyi2iroodvr"></a><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">1st</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Abundant Ammunition (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Post errata, this was hit hard, it&rsquo;s not nearly as valuable anymore.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Advanced Scurry (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is a very long duration fatigue with an additional penalty to strength and dexterity checks and some thrown in bleed, making it one awesome debuff.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Air Bubble (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Situational and short duration, although swift casting it could help save your life.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Ant Haul (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While the duration is long, you should eventually have extradimensional travel space.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Abstemiousness (**)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">More fitting for an adventure survival game, it could be nice there.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Aspect of the Nightingale (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Even for faces, this is too short duration and situational for me.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Bane (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A pretty standard group debuff, it&rsquo;s small so only use it on mobs, otherwise buff yourself.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Bless (***)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A nice group buff, the swiftcast isn&rsquo;t worth it, you have a MUCH better 1st level spell for that.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Blessed Fist (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Only useful if you expect allies to often lose their weapons, it otherwise functions as a slightly more janky magic weapon for unarmed strikes.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Bless Water (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Having to pay for this isn&rsquo;t great, holy water isn&rsquo;t your best offensive tool either.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Blessing of the Watch (***)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;For its situation, it&rsquo;s amazing, but the fact that it only works in one location keeps it from scoring any higher. &nbsp;Not a good swiftcast due to wasted potential.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Burning Disarm (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Either a disarm or some low fire damage, it&rsquo;s not a great use of actions for you.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Carrion Compass (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;An interesting and flavorful spell, it&rsquo;s really only useful in an undead game.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Command (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Rating higher for its versatility, none of the commands are very powerful, but they can each help in different ways, making it a more powerful option overall.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Compel Hostility (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;An immediate action needed to use this brings it down, but it is good for bodyguards.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Comprehend Languages (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Situational, but useful when it is, you don&rsquo;t get a ton of languages yourself.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Cultural Adaptation (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Really campaign specific, doubt most games will deal with this.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Cure Light Wounds (***)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Probably something you don&rsquo;t prepare, but curing is always in demand, and having access to it makes you a better person. &nbsp;Not worth the swiftcast though, just fervor heal.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Dancing Lantern (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;If you don&rsquo;t want to keep recasting light, the duration of this spell can keep it relevant for quite some time, although if you don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s a wasted slot.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Deadeye&rsquo;s Lore (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Just be a ranger.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Deathwatch (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A cool but ultimately missable spell.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Decompose Corpse (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Really doubt you need to do this often.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Detect Alignment (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This can help you make sure you know what team people are playing for, alignment wise. &nbsp;Just don&rsquo;t depend on it too much, as it can be fooled by magic.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Detect Charm</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c12">Demon</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c12">Faithful</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c12">Undead (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger; </span><span class="c2">Most of these are too campaign specific for general games.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c16">Divine Favor (*****)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is almost a class feature, and it will probably be your most commonly used swiftcast. &nbsp;The bonus is amazing (and can be buffed by the fate&rsquo;s favored trait), the duration is just enough for most combats, and you can swiftcast it. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d prepare it a few times a day myself, especially once you start getting to higher level. &nbsp;Definitely worth taking.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Diagnose Disease (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Heal&rsquo;s a class skill, use it.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Doom (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;I like this more than bane myself, better for single creature battles.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Dream Feast (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Or you could just eat.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Endure Elements (***)</span><span class="c3">&dagger; </span><span class="c2">Situational, but a godsend in those situations, and the duration is awesome.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Enhance Water (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;I&rsquo;d argue the term &lsquo;enhance&rsquo; here. &nbsp;This would be a fun cantrip, but as a first level spell, it doesn&rsquo;t do enough. &nbsp;Fun if you&rsquo;re going blade and tankard style though.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Entropic Shield (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Non-magical ranged attacks aren&rsquo;t a large threat, but miss chances are nice.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Face of the Devourer (***)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;With a decent duration, buff to intimidate, and even a bite attack thrown in, intimidators can have fun with this spell.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Fairness (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Do a lot of trade, do ya?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Firebelly (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The fire resistance is the big draw here, as the attack is weak and kills the duration.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Forbid Action (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Halting an opponent&rsquo;s action, even for 1 round, can be powerful. &nbsp;It won&rsquo;t completely shut them down, but it will help keep them from doing their most dangerous action.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Hairline Fracture (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Makes things easier to break, a pretty meh effect.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Haze of Dreams (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You have better debuffs than this.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Hide from Undead (***)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The duration here is quite nice and being able to skip past all forms of vision from undead is something I&rsquo;d expect from a higher level spell. &nbsp;While the will save for intelligent undead is limiting, the rest of the spell can really help you stay out of sight from undead, great in an undead heavy game.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Ice Armor (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Just buy armor.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Infernal Healing (***)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Overall, it&rsquo;ll end up being more healing than cure light wounds, although some people might have issues casting an obviously evil spell, and it&rsquo;s slower healing than cure light wounds.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Inflict Light Wounds (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Deal damage with a weapon, not this.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Ironbeard (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A weak AC buff doesn&rsquo;t validate this spell, even if it is metal as hell.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Karmic Blessing (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;No, just no.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Liberating Command (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s far too specific for what it&rsquo;s intended to do, skip it.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Lighten Object (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;I can&rsquo;t imagine needing this more than once a campaign.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Magic Stone (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Just by some weapons, please.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Magic Weapon (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;In the early goings, this is a good way to damage incorporeals, but drops off quickly.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Marid&rsquo;s Mastery (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger; </span><span class="c2">Basically water game only, meh.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Mighty Fist of the Earth (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;For unarmed fighters, this can be decent for getting a ranged attack.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Moment of Greatness (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Pretty terrible as swiftcast, only really good if you can pick up good morale bonuses like having a bard in the party.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Murderous Command (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Actually very nice action denial, but it also requires the target to have another person you want them to attack, limiting its usefulness slightly.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Obscuring Mist (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Obscuring the battlefield can be helpful to you and your allies.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Poisoned Egg (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Only good for when you want to offer an enemy an egg in this trying time.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Protection from Alignment (****)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Getting this as a swift cast is amazing, as it gives you an early and great defense buff as well as immunity from mind affecting effects from your opposed alignment is aces. &nbsp;While the AC and save bonuses will eventually become moot, the mind control and protection from summoned monsters is always a beautiful thing, definitely worth picking up.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Ray of Sickening (**)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Really only good if you have some way to stack this, although since it works as </span><span class="c0">ray of exhaustion</span><span class="c2">, if they fail against it twice, they&rsquo;re exhausted, and the duration isn&rsquo;t bad either.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Read Weather (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;And here&rsquo;s the weekend forecast!</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Recharge Innate Magic (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Most racial spell-like abilities are janky, but it does give 1 use to all of them.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Refined Improvised Weapon (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Most people can skip this, but this is a very long duration buff that can help out blade and tankard style by giving them an additional +1 to hit.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Reinforce Armaments (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Any fragile weapons you&rsquo;re wielding are on purpose.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Remove Fear</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c8">Sickness (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Situational but useful, these are especially good for swiftcast to keep you up.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Restore</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c12">Sanctify Corpse (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Very situational, something to only prepare when you know it&rsquo;s needed.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Sanctuary (***)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A solid defensive spell depending on your wisdom modifier, as a swiftcast this probably won&rsquo;t be great since you can&rsquo;t attack with it, but it&rsquo;s good for when you need to turn tail and retreat.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Shield of Faith (****)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Another solid swiftcast, the scaling nature of this keeps it relevant, possibly alleviating the need for a ring of deflection.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Spiked Armor (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Just buy armor spikes.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Stunning Barrier (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is an odd one, as the real bonus isn&rsquo;t the AC and save bonuses, it&rsquo;s the chance to stun an opponent attacking you. &nbsp;Stun is powerful, so it&rsquo;s worth considering.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Summon Minor Monsters (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Worthless unless you&rsquo;ve got something that needs tiny animals.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Summon Monster I (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is probably the best you&rsquo;ll ever be at summoning. &nbsp;Your spells don&rsquo;t scale in progression for the SM line, so as you level up, summoning spells get worse and worse.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Sun Metal (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Decent bonus damage, but the casting time makes it a non-option.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Swallow your Fear (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;&dagger;</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Basically eating a fear effect, the duration is actually pretty nice. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s your call on this or </span><span class="c0">remove fear</span><span class="c2">, but this does let you stay in charge of your actions while scared too.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Tap Inner Beauty (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The duration of this is too short, even for faces.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Touch of Bloodletting (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The duration of this is really damn short, which is a shame. &nbsp;But exhaustion from a 1st level spell is a rare thing, even if they need to take damage first. &nbsp;Better at later levels for sure.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Touch of Truthtelling (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The proof of activation really makes this one, everything else is meh.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Tracking Mark (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You&rsquo;re a ranger, yay?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Unbreakable Heart (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s basically an in battle cure, but suppression of emotions can be helpful.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Weapons Against Evil (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The short duration and weak penetration make this only viable in battle, so meh.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Weaponwand (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Buy a spring loaded wrist sheath, you&rsquo;re good.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c3 c14"></span></p><a id="id.yg15rtmjjzc8"></a><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">2nd</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Abeyance (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While 24 hours is a long time, only once on a curse ever is weak.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Aboleth&rsquo;s Lung (***)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A save or die with a bonus effect, the duration is very long meaning you can hit and run with it, definitely worth picking up, and possibly useful against more than one target.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Admonishing Ray (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A subduing scorching ray in effect, decent for knocking out people, but if you&rsquo;re going for subdual, I&rsquo;d just take a subdual weapon or trait.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Aid (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;A little defensive buff, it has a decent duration for pre battle, but the temporary HP will be burned through quick, leaving just a minor attack buff.</span><span class="c13 c3 c14">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Air Step (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A decent enough duration and some minor benefits make this okay, but it&rsquo;s not nearly flying.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Alchemical Tinker (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Just bad. &nbsp;Guns aren&rsquo;t good for you, and you can just buy different alchemical items.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Align Weapon (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;By the time you need aligned weapons, you&rsquo;ll probably have bought the one that you need. &nbsp;And before that point, alignment based DR isn&rsquo;t big enough to matter.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Alter Summoned Monster (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Not for your own summons, it&rsquo;s more just an anti-summon spell, very situational.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Amplify Stench (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger; </span><span class="c2">Good if you have stench, but you probably don&rsquo;t.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Ancestral Communion (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You&rsquo;re not a big knowledge kill person, leave it to someone else.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Angelic Aspect, Lesser (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger; </span><span class="c5">A slight upgrade to </span><span class="c0">protection from evil</span><span class="c2">, not a big enough bump up though.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Animate Dead, Lesser (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Neat as a party trick, but you&rsquo;re not making an army like this.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Ant Haul, Communal (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;By now you shouldn&rsquo;t need this.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Arrow of Law (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Way too situational, you need a very particular game to make this work.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Augury (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Knowing the future is nice, and while it&rsquo;s not too accurate or specific, it does help.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Bear&rsquo;s Endurance (***)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Out of the ability buffing spells, this is probably the most useful since a con bonus will most likely be a secondary purchase, with your strength or dexterity being primary.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Bestow Weapon Proficiency (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Really? &nbsp;Just use the weapons you have.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Blessing of Courage and Life (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;I consider this more a situational quick heal which isn&rsquo;t bad, but the duration is a little short, making it mostly a pre battle cast.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Blessing of Luck and Resolve (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Basically halfing only, and even then, it&rsquo;s not great.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Blinding Ray (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;One round of blinding isn&rsquo;t amazing, but once you get multiple rays, you can start blinding a few people at once, and it has a solid bonus against light sensitive foes.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Blood Blaze (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;What a weird and not good effect.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Blood in the Water (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Too specific to be good.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Blood of the Martyr (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger; </span><span class="c2">What the hell? &nbsp;No serious, what the hell? &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t do this, heal another way...ew&hellip;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Boiling Blood (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A terrible debuff or a decent strength buff, lower because it&rsquo;s (half) orc only.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Book Ward (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Keeping any books safe? &nbsp;Get this.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Bull&rsquo;s Strength (****)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Slightly lower since if you care about strength, you&rsquo;ll be getting a strength belt sooner, making the bonus for this less valuable. &nbsp;Still solid to use on yourself for more damage or party members though.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Burst of Radiance (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While the range isn&rsquo;t amazing, the duration of the blindness certainly is, and the damage against evil is a nice touch, although blindness is the big sell here.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Calm Emotions (***)</span><span class="c3">&dagger; </span><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s situational, but powerful when it works, and a strong swiftcast if you&rsquo;re tagged.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Cloud of Seasickness (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Here&rsquo;s a nice area debuff, sickened is a good debuff to stick on someone, so consider making a stank cloud to punish enemies.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Compassionate Ally (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;So you make someone into a good (but tactically dumb) person. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s okay if you want to group people together, but the duration is so short that it&rsquo;s hard to validate.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Consecrate</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c8">Desecrate (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;It has its uses, but not an everyday cast.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Cure Moderate Wounds (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Your cure spells aren&rsquo;t keeping up with the curve, get a wand and move on.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Darkness (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A decent enough spell, you&rsquo;ll need some synergy to make the most of this spell.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Death Candle (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While interesting, it&rsquo;s overall too weak to be of much value.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Death Knell (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A better overall spell, but targeting dying creatures generally means the battle&rsquo;s about over, and the duration isn&rsquo;t too long, so you&rsquo;ll need to be smart using this.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Deathwine (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;What a waste of a perfectly good potion for trash poison.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Defending Bone (***)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Now here&rsquo;s an interesting spell. &nbsp;Sadly bludgeoning damage is pretty common, but the duration of this is amazing, making a solid defensive buff, great for a 2nd level spell.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Delay Poison</span><span class="c5 c8">/</span><span class="c3 c8">Disease (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger; </span><span class="c2">Situational, but avoiding conditions keeps you in the fight.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Delay Pain (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger; </span><span class="c2">Pain effects are pretty rare, skip it.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Disfiguring Touch (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a long duration debuff, but it&rsquo;s on the weaker end.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Divine Trident (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You should just wield your own weapons.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Dread Bolt (*)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Less specific than </span><span class="c0">arrow of law</span><span class="c2">, but a worse debuff.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Eagle&rsquo;s Splendor (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Nothing you need here unless you&rsquo;re pretending to be a paladin.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Early Judgement (**)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Amusingly, this is best against good opponents, an odd debuff indeed.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Effortless Armor (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Just wear properly fitting armor, it&rsquo;s a speed boost for heavy armor types though.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Endure Elements, Communal (***)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Probably a better use of actions than casting it multiple times.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Enemy&rsquo;s Heart (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger; </span><span class="c5">A shorter duration </span><span class="c0">death knell</span><span class="c2">, it is more likely to work, so it&rsquo;s a toss up here.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Enthrall (**)</span><span class="c5 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">A nice range for this one makes it a decent call, but fascination is meh.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Find Traps (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Traps aren&rsquo;t worth a spell, get someone else to do it.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Flotsam Vessel (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You guessed it, too situational.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Gentle Repose (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Useful when it is, but how often will you need this?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Ghostbane Dirge (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Basically doubling damage vs ghost is a decent use of your action.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Gird Ally (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You ain&rsquo;t so summoner, Mac!</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Grace (*)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">This isn&rsquo;t worth your swift action, maybe if you&rsquo;re a cleave/vital striker, but meh even then.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Groundswell (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Not a great use of a swift action, just stay flanked.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Heroic Fortune (****)</span><span class="c3">&dagger; </span><span class="c2">If your game is using hero points, getting one as a swiftcast is very nice.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Hold Person (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A classic save or lose/die, this is always a strong call, especially with team work.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">(Un)Holy Ice Weapon (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Just bring your own weapon.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Imbue with Aura (*)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">When would this be useful?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Imbue with Elemental Assault (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Suli aren&rsquo;t good warpriest.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Inflict Moderate Wounds (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Just use a weapon.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Instant Armor</span><span class="c5 c12">/</span><span class="c3 c12">Weapon (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Another short duration kills these spells. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Instrument of Agony (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s an evil spell and the intimidate bonus isn&rsquo;t great, but the discharge effect is a pretty decent nausea effect, made better if you&rsquo;re also demoralizing in the same attack.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Ironskin (****)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;As a swiftcast, this is a very nice defensive buff with a nice discharge effect as well.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Lay of the Land (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You&rsquo;re not a ranger, stop acting like you are.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Life Channel (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Too specific, dhampirs aren&rsquo;t great warpriest.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Life Pact (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While a short duration, this can keep someone from dying, which is worth the effort.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Magic Boulder</span><span class="c5 c12">/</span><span class="c3 c12">Siege Engine (*)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Both of these probably won&rsquo;t apply to most games.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Make Whole (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;I can&rsquo;t imagine you&rsquo;ll need this a lot, but it&rsquo;s solid when you need it.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Marching Chant (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Unless you need to march a lot, skip it.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Martyr&rsquo;s Bargain (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Now here&rsquo;s something different. &nbsp;Not a lot of spells that you care about cause hit point damage, but if it&rsquo;s elemental, you could use the time to gain some resistance. &nbsp;Taking max damage is rough though, so this is almost a last resort to staying on your feat.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Masterwork Transformation (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;If you took heirloom trait, here&rsquo;s where you buff your heirloom.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Muffle Sound (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A pretty subpar way to get a stealth bonus.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Owl&rsquo;s Wisdom (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Only useful if you&rsquo;re trying to buff your DCs or will save.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Path of Glory (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A strange healing spell, it&rsquo;s easily skipped.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Pilfering Hand (**)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;A souped up </span><span class="c0">mage hand</span><span class="c2">, it&rsquo;s better for sneaks.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Protection from Alignment, Communal (***)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Protection from alignments is powerful, share it.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Protection from Outsiders (***)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A more specific defense, it also offers larger bonuses, making it overall better than the previous version if you know who you&rsquo;re going up against.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Protective Penumbra (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Yeah, no. &nbsp;Get some sun, gothy.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Recentering Drone (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger; </span><span class="c2">While nice to remove debuffs, taking concentration makes this a tough sell.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Reinforce Armaments, Communal (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Still no.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Remove Paralysis (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Probably best as a swiftcast, paralysis can lead to coup de grace.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Resist Energy (***)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Dropping the damage you take from energy can be great given the right situation, especially if you know what you&rsquo;ll be facing.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Restoration, Lesser (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A great band aid spell, perfect for patch jobs.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Shard of Chaos (*)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Another </span><span class="c0">arrow of law</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;knockoff, but against a worse alignment.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Sacred Space (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Way too specific.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Savage Maw (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Natural attacks aren&rsquo;t great for you.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Sentry Skull (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Actually a really good camp spell, it&rsquo;s pretty nice for keeping you informed of things approaching your camp as well as having an amazing duration.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Share Language (**)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5">I like this more than </span><span class="c0">comprehend language</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;myself, helps keep everyone communicating.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Shatter (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s decent for breaking things, as you&rsquo;d expect.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Shield of Fortification (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;I&rsquo;m not much a fan of 25% fortification.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Shield Other (***)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">For those who want to tank, this will let you eat hits for others.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Shock Arrow (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Just bring a light.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Silence (***)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A very nice utility spell for sneaking around, it&rsquo;s always worth considering for sneaks.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Silent Table (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;More of a utility, but a pretty unique one, keeps your convos quiet.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Snow Shape (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Are you around snow enough to make something like this good?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Soothing Word (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Again better as a swift cast, it&rsquo;s okay, but nothing too amazing to reduce conditions.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Sound Burst (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The stun is the real benefit here, as even one round of stun can change fights.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Spear of Purity (***)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Arrow of Law</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;for good, but blinding foes that you&rsquo;re likely to face is quite nice.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Spell Gauge (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;If you could cast this secretly, maybe it&rsquo;d be good, but otherwise pass.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Spiritual Weapon (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;With a decent duration, this is yet another source of damage. &nbsp;While you can&rsquo;t swiftcast it, it will provide solid damage if you want another turn to set up for battle.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Staggering Fall (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A decent option for a trip build, otherwise it&rsquo;s too specific.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Status (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Amazing duration and a pretty cool effect allow you to make sure everyone&rsquo;s okay without metagaming, providing you with information on their condition.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Stone Throwing (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Pass unless you&rsquo;re always fighting giants.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Summon Monster II (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You&rsquo;re falling behind the curve, your summons aren&rsquo;t on par with other summoners.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Surmount Affliction (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Probably the worst of the condition avoiders.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Touch of Mercy (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Just take the penalty, a spell isn&rsquo;t worth it, especially with this duration.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Track Ship (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You&rsquo;ll know if this is worth it by the game you&rsquo;re playing.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Trail of the Rose (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This feels like there&rsquo;s something there, but I can&rsquo;t see it, it just seems too weak.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Tremor Blast (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A decent battlefield control spell, tripping can be pretty nice, especially tripping a group.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Twisted Futures (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Only good if you know your opponent can reroll, not a common ability.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Undetectable Alignment (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Situational, but sometimes you just need to cool your aura a bit.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Unliving Rage (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Rage isn&rsquo;t good normally, it&rsquo;s not good for undead either.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Weapon of Awe (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Basically just weapon specialization as a spell, no swiftcast hurts a lot though.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Web Shelter (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A temporary shelter that only fits one, won&rsquo;t make your party too happy.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Whispering Lore (*)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Knowledge Bonuses, meh. &nbsp;Elf only, too.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Zone of Truth (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The worst thing about this spell is not knowing if it worked, so it&rsquo;s hard to rely on.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><a id="id.iovekmi8i03n"></a><p class="c6"><span class="c3">3rd</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Accept Affliction (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger; </span><span class="c2">By this point, you should be curing these things, not accepting them.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Agonize (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s evil and you probably aren&rsquo;t making many extraplanar deals with your list.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Agonizing Rebuke (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Short duration and mild subdual damage are really quite weak.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Aggravate Affiliation (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Yeah, not super common.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Air Breathing (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Pretty nice duration if you&rsquo;re planning on swimming a lot. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Align Weapon, Communal (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Yeah, don&rsquo;t like it communal either.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Animate Dead (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You&rsquo;re not the best at animating dead, but this is a decent way of doing it.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Archon&rsquo;s Aura (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Giving a save for this and a lackluster effect makes it worth passing.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Aura of Cannibalism (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Way too specific to be good, even generally this would have been meh.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Aura of Inviolate Ownership (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Get robbed a lot? &nbsp;Invest in perception.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Aura Sight (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Do you really need to see auras that much?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Badger&rsquo;s Ferocity (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You have better things to do with your action than sharpen weapons.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Bestow Curse (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This curse is a pretty hefty penalty, and getting it to stick will definitely debuff your opponents hard. &nbsp;Hell, with such a long duration, you could stick it on someone and just leave, come back later, and crush them. &nbsp;Combos well with other debuffs for some solid debuffing.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Bestow Insight (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You&rsquo;re good with the skill buffs, don&rsquo;t worry about them.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Blessing of the Mole (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Short duration darkvision is meh, but it&rsquo;s communal.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Blindness/Deafness (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Blindness is an awesome debuff, it&rsquo;ll probably be your go to debuff most of the time. &nbsp;Deafness is okay, but a lot more situational, use it when needed.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Blood Biography (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A pretty unique information gathering spell, worth it if you like learning about people.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Blood Scent (***)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Normally I wouldn&rsquo;t like this, but the damage buff that comes along with it for raging or half orcs is really nice. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s worse as a swift cast though, needs to be used for the party.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Blot (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;If you hate writing, here you go!</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Chains of Perdition (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A free dirty trick or trip once a round isn&rsquo;t bad, and ignoring concealment and such is a nice bonus. &nbsp;A decent option if you have a few opponents to smash up, less useful against one though.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Channel the Gift (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s an option to help your friends and not a terrible one, a real teamwork spell.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c16">Channel Vigor (*****)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re not swiftcasting </span><span class="c0">divine favor</span><span class="c5">, it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re casting this. &nbsp;While the other benefits are nice, the money here is the </span><span class="c0">haste</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;effect, which while not as good as a group haste can seriously increase your effectiveness unless you&rsquo;re using cleave or vital strike. &nbsp;Seriously, anyone who&rsquo;s making more than one attack a round will want this hard, and the other benefits are nice too.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Charitable Impulse (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A strange action denial, it&rsquo;s probably better out of combat when used on a rich NPC, at least if you&rsquo;re able to run before the spell&rsquo;s duration is over and they want their stuff back.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Contagion (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Less of a battle spell and more of a just ruining someone&rsquo;s life spell, finding a way to cast this without being caught is probably the best way to use it.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Continual Flame (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A solid duration helps make this spell, but not something you&rsquo;ll need often.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Control Vermin (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Want to ride bugs? &nbsp;Really?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Create Food and Water (**)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Everyone needs to eat.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Cure Serious Wounds (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Again, not your best healing, stick with wands.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Daybreak Arrow (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Rated higher for the nice duration, the additional damage is pretty nice too for ranged attackers, but it&rsquo;s only useful vs. undead opponents and other sunlight vulnerable foes.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Daylight (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Nothing you&rsquo;ll need all the time, but light&rsquo;s helpful if you can&rsquo;t see in the dark.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Deadly Juggernaut</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(****)&dagger;</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a hard call between this and </span><span class="c0">divine favor</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;as both are luck bonuses. &nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Divine favor</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;is more of an immediate bonus, but this can get more powerful and give DR, great for cleavers.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Deeper Darkness (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Darkness is pretty nice, although make sure you&rsquo;re okay with supernatural darkness.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Delay Poison, Communal (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Nice if you know you&rsquo;re going into a poisonous place.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Discovery Torch (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Too small a bonus for this level.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Dispel Magic (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Magic is power, getting rid of magic is also powerful.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Divine Illumination (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Light that bothers undead, but you don&rsquo;t channel, so skip it.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Elemental Speech (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger; </span><span class="c2">Wanna talk to elementals? &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t, they&rsquo;re boring.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Enter Image (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;An interesting sneak spell, you&rsquo;ll need a few pictures of yourself to make this work.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">False Alibi (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Another sneak spell, one of your few (specific) mind affect spells like this.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Final Sacrifice (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A cool countermeasure against summoners, only for use on enemy summons.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Fractions of Heal and Harm (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You don&rsquo;t have the damage spells to make this worth using.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Glyph of Warding (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A neat little trap spell, nothing amazing here.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Guiding Star (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;If you get lost often, this spell can help, and the long duration makes it decent.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Helping Hand (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Unique in its function, it&rsquo;s useful but only if you really need to find someone.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Hydrophobia (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Only really useful in water, it can flat out remove someone from underwater combat.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Inflict Serious Wounds (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Again, use a weapon.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Invisibility Purge (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Invisibility is strong, but it&rsquo;s not incredibly common. &nbsp;Situationally useful.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Ki Leech (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Do you have ki? &nbsp;Probably not.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Life Shield (***)</span><span class="c3">&dagger; </span><span class="c2">A stellar defense against undead, this is quite powerful and has a solid duration.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Locate Object (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Sometimes you really need to find something, an agency increasing spell here.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Lover&rsquo;s Vengeance (***)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;While </span><span class="c0">rage</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;isn&rsquo;t a great spell, it&rsquo;s basically a more specific</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;contingency</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;spell, which as we all know is great for action economy. &nbsp;The extended version is nice too, but the duration makes this great as long as you know you&rsquo;ll be up against someone you hate.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Magic Circle Against Alignment (***)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;A longer duration </span><span class="c0">protection from alignment</span><span class="c2">, the bonuses aren&rsquo;t as impressive, although it is useful for making deals with extraplanar creatures.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Magic Vestments (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The duration of this is incredible, and the bonus is actually scaling in a nice fashion, making this an awesome boost to your defense, making you even less item dependant.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Mantle of Calm (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Is...is this an anti-buff?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Mark of Obvious Ethics (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Do you really need to tattle on someone&rsquo;s alignment?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Meld into Stone (***)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While somewhat dangerous, this is a very nice sneak spell with a very nice duration, making you very adept at spying on others and as a last ditch defensive measure.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Monstrous Extremity (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While you can swiftcast this, you&rsquo;re better off avoiding that, as you need time to &lsquo;train&rsquo; with it. &nbsp;Natural attacks aren&rsquo;t great for you, but giving a party member who focuses of them hooves is brutal enough to really amp up their damage, and the duration is really solid as well.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Nap Stack (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Very nice for keeping you and your party healthy, the only thing holding this back is the once a week limitation, as otherwise it&rsquo;s good for getting in a quick rest to be ready to fight much faster.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Obscure Object (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Helpful if you&rsquo;ve got a one ring to hide.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Paragon Surge (****)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Half-elf only, but wow is this solid. &nbsp;Even with the nerf, it&rsquo;s quite nice to get a dex bonus and a free feat as a swift action on a swiftcast, making it a very versatile spell.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Plant Voice (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Wow, you&rsquo;re really sad, aren&rsquo;t you?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Prayer (***)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Not great for a swiftcast, but a buff as well as a debuff (that&rsquo;s buffed by fate&rsquo;s favored) is worth considering, especially without a save.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Protection from Energy (****)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;An awesome defense against elemental damage, it&rsquo;s temp immunity from one element that you can set up as a swiftcast to avoid firebreath and such.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Raging Rubble (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is too weak at this level, no need to anger the rocks.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Reaper&rsquo;s Coterie (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Deadly juggernaut is already better than this, pass on it.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Remove Blindness/Deafness</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c8">Curse</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c8">Disease</span><span class="c5 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c8">(**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;When you need this, it&rsquo;s worth it. &nbsp;Situational though.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Resist Energy, Communal (***)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Just as solid as before, but now for the whole party!</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Returning Weapon, Communal (*)</span><span class="c5 c12">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Not worth the effort to cast.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Riversight (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Oh no, they&#39;re headed for dry land! &nbsp;We&rsquo;ll never catch them now! &nbsp;Incorrect, look! &nbsp;A canal! &nbsp;Go, Knightboat, go!</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Sacred Bond (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You shouldn&rsquo;t be doing in battle healing, making this less than useful.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Sadomasochism (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You&rsquo;ll be taking more damage, but more chances to demoralize, it&rsquo;s a weird tradeoff.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Sands of time (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You have better debuffs than this.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Searing Light (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;At least against undead it&rsquo;s decent, but not as good as a weapon.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Severed Fate (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Most opponents won&rsquo;t have hero points, making this a situational debuff at best.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Share Language, Communal (***)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Having the whole party on board is very nice, language wise.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Skeleton Crew (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Also useful for convincing kids and their dog that your ship is haunted.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Sky Swim (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;More janky flying, and needs a swim speed for full potential, making it a harder sell here.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Speak with Dead (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A really nice information gathering spell, as long as you&rsquo;re smart about it.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Stone Shape (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is a spell for creative people that can use it in different and interesting ways, as stone is a very common material to have around you, especially in dungeons.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Stunning Barrier, Greater (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Not much better, but can possibly rack up more stuns.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Summon Monster III (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Again behind the curve, nothing more than a meat shield here.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Summon Totem Creature (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;New list, same problems.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Symbol of Healing (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Decent but expensive healing, the real idea for this is to make it permanent and carry it around with you on an object, use it daily to help heal up the party when you can. &nbsp;Hell, take it into an undead heavy place, get some cheap damage on them too.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Transfer Regeneration (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While if you have regeneration, transferring isn&rsquo;t a bad idea since you&rsquo;re probably one of the few (if only people in your party to have it), so it&rsquo;s basically another healing spell.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Trial of Fire and Acid (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Without imposing any penalties, this is just easily resisted elemental damage.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Unravel Destiny (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Same hero point issue here.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Vision of Hell (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A slight fear buff, not the most powerful tool in an intimidating arsenal though.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Water Breathing (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The duration really makes this useful for when you need to fish it up.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Water Walk (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger; </span><span class="c2">Or when you just want to walk over water instead of swimming, weaker duration though.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Water of Maddening (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;How often do you get opponents to drink things? &nbsp;Ever?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Wind Wall (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A very nice defense against arrows and small projectiles, not great for archers though.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Wrathful Mantle (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The duration isn&rsquo;t long enough to make the resistance bonus worth it for much.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c3 c14"></span></p><a id="id.xdkxmscoxawr"></a><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">4th</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Abyssal Vermin (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Turning your roaches into demon roaches, because that&rsquo;s what cool people do.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Airwalk (****)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Like Jordan did before you, this is still kind of janky flying, but the duration is nice and solid, and the mobility is quite nice, although it&rsquo;s still not flight.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Ancestral Gift (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You could make any weapon this good, don&rsquo;t make grandpa give ya a sword.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Anti-Incorporeal Shell (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger; </span><span class="c2">For when you ARE afraid of no ghost.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Ardor&rsquo;s Onslaught (*)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5">I hate </span><span class="c5">these</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;filthy </span><span class="c5">neutrals</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Kif! With enemies </span><span class="c5">you</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;know where they stand but with </span><span class="c5">neutrals</span><span class="c2">? Who knows! It sickens me.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Aura of Doom (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;I wish this continued to force saves, it&rsquo;d be higher, but possibly shakes up enemies.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Battle Trance (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;So this gives ferocity, a small amount of temporary hit points, and...4 intelligences damage to you, as well as causing you to need concentration checks to cast? &nbsp;Wow, that&rsquo;s every kind of bad.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Black Spot (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A nice long term debuff, but only if you can tag someone you&rsquo;ll be fighting days later.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Blessing of Fervor (****)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The hardback channel vigor, if your GM doesn&rsquo;t let you use channel vigor, this is the next best choice, although the haste effect is late for your level. &nbsp;What it does offer is affecting the entire party, so if you&rsquo;re not swiftcasting it, it&rsquo;s actually a solid party buff spell.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Bloatbomb (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You can only kill something a lot weaker, and the bomb duration is painfully short.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Blood Crow Strike (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While cool, fire damage isn&rsquo;t good at this level, and neither is negative energy damage. &nbsp;Really, you&rsquo;re probably going unarmed to go bad touch, which makes this even less viable.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Burst with Light (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Weak damage over time with a garbage duration isn&rsquo;t worth your time at this level.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Chaos Hammer</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c7">Holy Smite</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c8">Order&rsquo;s Wrath</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c8">Unholy Blight</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c8">(**)</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c7">(***)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5">With how many foes of each you&rsquo;ll fight as well as the effects of each, </span><span class="c0">holy smite</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;can at least be decent, while the rest are meh at best.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Control Summoned Creature (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Stealing a summoned creature is a two person swing, but you&rsquo;ll have to know you&rsquo;ll be facing summoned creatures, making this hard to suggest without that knowledge.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Control Water (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Another spell for creative people, it fares much better in a sea based game.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Crusader&rsquo;s Edge (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Being unable to swiftcast holds this back, but bane is REALLY strong, and so is nauseating a foe, making this a decent spell to prepare as the duration is good enough for pre battle.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Cure Critical Wounds (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Still behind the curve.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Death Ward (****)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While it&rsquo;s a specific defensive measure, what it gives is total immunity to negative energy and negative levels, which is HUGE. &nbsp;Definitely specific, but also game changing.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Debilitating Portent (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;No initial save is nice, but making a save for each attack a creature makes can slow down a game a lot. &nbsp;Better on big hit creatures, especially animals who are likely to fail this save often.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Dimensional Anchor (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Keeping creatures from teleporting out can really help keep a caster in place.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Discern Lies (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Again the problem of just knowing they&rsquo;re lying without getting the truth pops up here.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Dismissal (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A save or lose against most outsiders, hope you&rsquo;re not fighting on their home turf.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Divination (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Knowledge is power, and this gives even more knowledge if you know what to ask.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c16">Divine Power (*****)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Say goodbye to </span><span class="c0">divine favor</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;and hello to your new buff spell of choice. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Enchantment Foil (***)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Being enchanted sucks. &nbsp;Getting an untyped bonus for hours and being able to fake being enchanted is awesome, although you&rsquo;ll need to invest in bluff a bit to pull it off.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Fleshworm Infestation (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;First, ew. &nbsp;Second, staggering for possibly multiple rounds with solid dex damage and even just sickening on a successful save is a good way of debuffing. &nbsp;Third, ew.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Forceful Strike (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The bonus damage is okay, and it&rsquo;s also a decent maneuvering tool, if high leveled.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Freedom of Movement (****)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Being trapped is the worst, being not trapped is the opposite of the worst. &nbsp;Even better as a swiftcast to keep you mobile longer.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Giant Vermin (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;So you make giant bugs, good job Roach Coach.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Gift of the Deep (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Doubt you&rsquo;re a sahuagin, moving on.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Globe of Tranquil Water (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Your own happy water bubble, perfect for almost nothing.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Guardian of Faith (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The spells granted don&rsquo;t really stack, better to cast them separately.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Hallucinogenic Smoke (****)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is a massive debuff in a 30 foot cone, and if you swiftcast it you can exhale in the same action, making it amazing for your action economy. &nbsp;Nauseated is brutal as well, so smoke!</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Healing Warmth (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Fire&rsquo;s a common damage type, and honestly it&rsquo;s nice to have something to do with your leftover resistance if you don&rsquo;t use all of it. &nbsp;Not a huge upgrade, but worth considering.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Heavy Water (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A decent area denial in water, although the DC for this isn&rsquo;t too hard to meet.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Imbue with Spell Ability (*)</span><span class="c5 c12">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">I&rsquo;m not a fan of handing out your spells to others like this, just cast yourself.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Infernal Healing, Greater (***)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;So 40 health instead of 10, reliable if evil.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Inflict Critical Wounds (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Still no.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Instant Restoration (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You&rsquo;re not summoning, so you don&rsquo;t need this.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Magic Weapon, Greater (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is late for you, but okay if you want to buff an ally&rsquo;s weapon.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Make Whole, Greater (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Nice if you really want to be Fix It Felix.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Mark of the Reptile God (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A strange long term debuff, slowly turning someone into a lizard isn&rsquo;t terrible.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Master&rsquo;s Escape (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The duration is too short to even use this as a neat trick.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Nature&rsquo;s Ravages (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A sneak spell for making a corpse look older, it&rsquo;s really situational.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Neutralize Poison (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Poison can be rough, take this if you&rsquo;re afraid of poison.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Path of Glory, Greater (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Meh healing, nothing more.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Plague Carrier (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Disease is too slow for most engagements, you can do better.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Persistent Vigor (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger; </span><span class="c2">Weak healing and immunity to nausea and sickened is okay at best.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Planar Adaptation (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;When you need to be on another plane, this is the way to do it.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Planar Ally, Lesser (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You&rsquo;re not the most charismatic, and the delayed spell level really hurts here, but you might be able to find something to bargain with that&rsquo;s worth your time.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Poison (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The con damage is okay, but feels a little weak at this point in the game.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Protection from Energy, Communal (***)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Useful if you want to save lower level spells.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Repel Vermin (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Probably too high a level for me to suggest, but swarms are always annoying.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Rest Eternal (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;My problem here is by the time you get it, it&rsquo;s easy to overcome.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Restoration (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Another late arrival, it&rsquo;s still a very good way to keep everyone on their feet.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Ride the Waves (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Full fledged swimming but pretty late for you.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Sending (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While it has a long casting time, staying in communication is very important.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Shadow Barbs (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Bring your own weapon, what&rsquo;s so hard to understand here?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Shield of Dawn (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Yeah, fire damage isn&rsquo;t great to deal at this level...not great at all.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Shield of Fortification, Greater (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Better, 50% is nice, but has a lot of competition now.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Soothe Construct (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Does this REALLY come up enough to need a spell?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Speak with Haunt (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Depends on if your game uses haunts, but solving a haunt could be a lot of fun.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Spellcrash, Lesser (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This scaled too poorly to be of value for you.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Spell Immunity (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Another issue of scaling here, but immunity is a powerful thing.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Spiritual Ally (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A lot better for sneaks to get an ally to flank with, the attack bonus of this ally isn&rsquo;t bad and they can help draw attention away from you, as well as avoiding physical damage itself.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Spit Venom (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;One round of blindness? &nbsp;Even the poison doesn&rsquo;t save this.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Summon Accuser (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The duration and use of this creature as a spy help push it into useful territory.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Summon Monster IV (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Just don&rsquo;t summon.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Summoner Conduit (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You don&rsquo;t deal spell damage, not even to summoned monsters.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Suppress Primal Magic (?)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;I&rsquo;m not familiar enough with primal magic to rate this.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Symbol of Revelation (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Better permanent, but you need to get them to look at it.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Symbol of Slowing (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Better permanent, but you need to get them to look at it.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Terrible Remorse (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Post errata, this isn&rsquo;t worth it anymore.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Tongues (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Another late spell, it&rsquo;s decent for understanding whatever anyone&rsquo;s saying.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Transplant Visage (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A rather creepy sneak spell to steal someone&rsquo;s face, the fact that it&rsquo;s permanent could cause problems, although there is some magic that will fix this situation.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Virulence (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Affects you and relies on people to have diseases? &nbsp;Nope.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Ward of the Season (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;None of these effects are worth your time.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Ward Shield (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Decent SR against targeted spells, sadly it doesn&rsquo;t affect enough to be great.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Water Walk, Communal (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;&dagger;</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re casting this in the first place, chances are your party needs it too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c3 c14"></span></p><a id="id.pg4ay1dvkuhb"></a><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">5th</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Air Walk, Communal (***)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Just saving lower level spell slots again, never a bad thing.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Ancestral Memory (?)&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is as helpful as your GM will let it be.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Angelic Aspect (***)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Some small DR and mild resistances aren&rsquo;t bad, just not great. &nbsp;Flight is though.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Astral Projection, Lesser (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Only of value if you&rsquo;re adventuring on the astral plane already.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Atonement (?)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Another story specific spell, its value is up to you.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Boneshatter (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The damage is just okay, but damage plus debuff is solid, even on a save.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Break Enchantment (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Another bandaid spell, this is one you&rsquo;ll probably eventually need.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Breath of Life (****)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Another bandaid spell but one that can save a ton of grief.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Burst of Glory (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Wow, this is REALLY weak for this level. &nbsp;The temp HP does not save this at all.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Caustic Blood (***)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Normally I wouldn&rsquo;t like this, but the amount of damage it can provide is substantial.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Cleanse (****)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Your in battle refresh, the healing is okay, but scrubbing you clean of a lot of statuses as well as a </span><span class="c0">break enchantment</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;effect is enough to make sure you stay in the fight.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Command, Greater (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The added duration and targets help keep this viable late game.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Constricting Coils (****)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Since you don&rsquo;t normally get </span><span class="c0">hold monster</span><span class="c2">, a damaging one is very nice.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Contagion, Greater (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;More sickness, it&rsquo;s stronger but nothing amazing.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Cure Light Wounds, Mass (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You&rsquo;re not a healer, especially not like this.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Curse of Magic Negated (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Decent enough, it does give them spell resistance, but a hard enough check to cast themselves, making it a double edged sword.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Curse, Major (*)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;This is a terrible upgrade to </span><span class="c0">bestow curse</span><span class="c2">.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Daywalker (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;So you can play an undead or at least make them &lsquo;normal&rsquo;, pretty late though.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Dispel Balance</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c8">Chaos</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c8">Evil</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c8">Good</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c8">Law</span><span class="c5 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c8">(**)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Kind of a catch all for your other spells like this, I don&rsquo;t care for this as an upgrade as much, especially without being able to swiftcast. &nbsp;Just use </span><span class="c0">banishment</span><span class="c2">.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Disrupting Weapon (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Actually pretty good, undead hit dice are lower in pathfinder and will saves aren&rsquo;t high, meaning this could actually help break some undead heads.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Fickle Winds (***)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;A bit late, archers now can join in with the </span><span class="c0">wind wall</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;fun.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Flame Strike (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You&rsquo;re not a damage caster, don&rsquo;t act like it.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Forbid Action, Greater (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;More great action denial for longer and with more targets.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Geniekind (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The bonuses here aren&rsquo;t as good as others, you have better buffs.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Ghostbane Dirge, Greater (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Ghost are generally solo encounters, so more targets for this isn&rsquo;t helpful.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Ghoul Army (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Too late to be great, the duration is okay enough, but these monsters won&rsquo;t do a lot.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Half Blood Extraction (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;In no way is a full blooded orc better than a half orc.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">(Un)Hallow (***)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">While it cost some cash, setting up a zone for you and your friends to be good or evil without fear of possession and other effects like that is easily worth it.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Heroic Fortune, Mass (***)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;&dagger; </span><span class="c2">Not a great swiftcast, but making everyone heroic is a nice buff.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">(Un)Holy Ice (***)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Solely this high because of </span><span class="c0">wall of ice</span><span class="c2">, it gives you some options you didn&rsquo;t have before.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Hymn of Mercy (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Forcing everyone to deal nonlethal is nice if you&rsquo;ve picked up some DR.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Inflict Light Wounds, Mass (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Why would you take this? &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t take this.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Insect Plague (*)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Wasp swarms aren&rsquo;t relevant at this level.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Life Bubble (***)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s late, but it is a very nice duration and can be shared which is very nice.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Lighten Object, Mass (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Do you really need to lighten a lot of objects? &nbsp;Really?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Magic Siege Engine, Greater (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Not better at a higher level either.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Mark of Justice (?)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is as good as the game allows it to be, but a cool spell to me.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Pillar of Life (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is just bad healing for this level.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Plane Shift (****)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Even late, this is both an awesome save or lose spell or a great travel spell, both of which are nice uses for it. &nbsp;While late, it&rsquo;s just as good now as it was for clerics.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Planeslayer&rsquo;s Call (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The bonuses aren&rsquo;t amazing, it&rsquo;s basically spell penetration and 10+ energy damage.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Raise Dead (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s late, but it&rsquo;s also bringing someone back from the dead, always a good thing.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Rapid Repair (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;A slightly better </span><span class="c0">greater infernal healing</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;for constructs, but good healing for them.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Reprobation (?)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;A more specific </span><span class="c0">mark of justice</span><span class="c2">, it&rsquo;s also a cool story spell that can&rsquo;t really be rated.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Righteous Might (****)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Probably your second buff after </span><span class="c0">divine power</span><span class="c2">, the size increase is the real draw here as you get weapons that hit harder and improved reach. &nbsp;The DR is nice and the strength bonus is mostly appreciated, but the size increase is the real draw. &nbsp;Amazing for a reach build as well, but pretty late sadly.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Sanctify Weapons (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Barely green, the ability to help your party ignore the DR of planar creatures is a very nice benefit, but the duration keeps it strictly an in combat spell.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Scrying (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Knowledge is power. &nbsp;This is knowledge. Seriously, scrying is awesome.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Serenity (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The nonlethal damage at this level is just pathetic, pass.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Siphon Magic (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Basically a dispel with a bonus, it&rsquo;s worth considering if you want to steal spells.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Slay Living (*)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Wow, this is really bad, especially at this level.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Smite Abomination (***)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While it sucks it has to be undead, this is a strong boost against them.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Snake Staff (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Snakes aren&rsquo;t worth your time at this point, pass.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Soulswitch (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This only works if you have a familiar, but it&rsquo;s nice as a scouting spell.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Spell Immunity, Communal (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Way too late to be good, sorry.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Spell Resistance (***)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Since your swiftcast ignore your SR, it makes for a decent defense. &nbsp;The duration is actually decent on this, especially at this level, making this a viable defense against magic too.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Spellsteal (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Way too many hoops to jump through for a 3rd level spell you might not even get.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Summon Infernal Devils (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Sorry, these aren&rsquo;t relevant at this level.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Summon Lesser Psychopomp (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;See above.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Summon Monster V (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You&rsquo;re no summoner, take 5.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Symbol of Pain (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A decent debuff if you&rsquo;re going the permanent route.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Symbol of Scrying (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Another solid information spell, good if you have a home base.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Symbol of Striking (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A fun defensive symbol, have it beat on strangers who cross you.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Symbol of Sleep (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The hit dice limit really kills this, but it&rsquo;s good for knocking out mooks.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Tongues, Communal (**)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Keep everyone in the loop, although not sure if it&rsquo;s worth a 5th level slot here.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Treasure Stitching (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;For a sneak, this is a great way to keep things hidden. &nbsp;Even for everyone else, it&rsquo;s a solid spell for transporting just about anything of which you can think easily.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">True Seeing (****)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">Dislike illusions? &nbsp;Now they&rsquo;re not a problem.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Undeath Ward (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Great for avoiding undead swarms, really more of an archer&rsquo;s tool though.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Wall of Blindness/Deafness (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A wall that blinds people is a nice defense for ranged warpriest.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Wall of Stone (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A very nice spell for you, this allows some decent battlefield manipulation, keeping foes where you need them and away from people who need protection.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><a id="id.2o291by0bcuw"></a><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">6th</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Animate Object (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While it&rsquo;s late, it&rsquo;s also still just as viable, helping you make some buddies to help out.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Antilife Shell (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Not working against outsiders holds it back, but the amount that this spell keeps out makes it outstanding for ranged characters with a pretty nice duration too.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Banishment (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A save or lose against outsiders with a DC that can be buffed, what&rsquo;s not to love?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Bear&rsquo;s Endurance, Mass (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;At this level you should have con belts, don&rsquo;t bother with this.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Blade Barrier (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A decent damage and battlefield control spell, it&rsquo;s versatile enough to split people up and does enough damage to stay relevant even if it&rsquo;s not too dangerous.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Blessings of Luck and Resolve, Mass (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;&dagger; </span><span class="c2">Not better mass, just not good at all.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Bloodsworn Retribution (***)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;An interesting spell, you can permanently lower your hit points to get bonuses towards one specific goal. &nbsp;It really depends on how central this goal is to the game, as you could probably get away with going very vague but most GMs would probably avoid letting you do that.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Bull&rsquo;s Strength, Mass (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Same as the other mass spells, too late to be of value.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Chains of Light (****)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Now this is nice for your level, stopping things from using an SLA </span><span class="c0">teleportation</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;to evade things is a real issue now, and this keeps them where they need to be.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Cold Ice Strike (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The swift action cast isn&rsquo;t very important to you, but it is another way to pile on damage if you&rsquo;re done buffing since you&rsquo;ll always be hitting hard with this.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Create Undead (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The undead creation spell of choice, its late inclusion really hurts it.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Cure Moderate Wounds, Mass (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t heal like this, it&rsquo;s not good.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Dimensional Blade (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While touch attacks are nice, only working on one weapon makes it weak for TWF, and your BAB isn&rsquo;t high enough to grant a large number of attacks to abuse this with sadly.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Dispel Magic, Greater (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The added options here only make a good thing better.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Dust Form (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;At this level, this is just too weak of an effect to be valid.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Dust Ward (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;I&rsquo;m not a huge fan of destroying my own stuff. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s thematic for a sneak, but not much else.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Eagle&rsquo;s Splendor, Mass (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Another trash mass spell.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Eaglesoul (***)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;An odd good only buffing spell, the effects are okay but the loss to duration for activating them makes it a hard sell for most, even if auto confirming a crit is nice.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Elemental Assessor (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is trash damage at your level.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Emblem of Greed (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is an odd one, as the real benefit here is getting a full BAB. &nbsp;The glaive isn&rsquo;t a bad weapon, but you&rsquo;re losing most of your enhancements to your weapon for around a +3 to hit and an additional attack in a round, making this an interesting route to take.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Epidemic (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The lowered DC on infecting others makes this very weak, only good out of combat for more storyline related situations where you need to get a lot of low level enemies sick.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Find the Path (?)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is as good as the GM lets it be, but RAW it&rsquo;s amazing.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Forbiddance (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A pretty nice warding spell, it&rsquo;s solid for if you have a base of operations.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Geas-Quest (?)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Another more storyline related spell, it&rsquo;s also super powerful if you can pull it off.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Glyph of Warding, Greater (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Better protection than before, but still nothing too impressive.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Harm (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s trash if you&rsquo;re using it to hurt, but AMAZING if you&rsquo;re undead and healing with it.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c16">Heal (*****)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;THE in game battle healing spell, and swiftcasting it makes it so you can tank just about anything. &nbsp;Probably your best in battle spell for this level.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Hellfire Ray (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The damage here is still weak, and sending someone to hell doesn&rsquo;t get you anything.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Heroes&rsquo; Feast (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a nice pre big battle buff for the whole party, worth considering for hard encounters.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Impart Mind (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The cost of this spell isn&rsquo;t worth the duration, as well as the random factor of it all.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Inflict Moderate Wounds, Mass (*)</span><span class="c3">&dagger;&dagger;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This wasn&rsquo;t good before, it&rsquo;s not good now.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Joyful Rapture (**)</span><span class="c5 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Situational again, it&rsquo;s not an everyday prep unless you&rsquo;re often facing emotional problems.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Music of the Sphere (*)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Out of battle only and not even great there, you have </span><span class="c0">heal</span><span class="c2">, use that to heal.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Oasis (**)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Basically permanent </span><span class="c0">create water</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;in a sense, but nice for when you need a drink...for a while.</span></p><p

stormed us faster than we could defend, bringing to bear such a myriad of techniques that as soon as we learned how to fight one, the next would already be on us with some unseen abilities. &nbsp;I can&rsquo;t imagine I&rsquo;ll be able to fight for some time after this.&rdquo; Enxo Vard, former cultist of the Steel Claw</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">The amount of value archetypes have for warpriest is immense, as some are quite solid shifts to the class. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s pretty amazing how much you can alter your style with just the selection of an archetype, so make sure you&rsquo;re very careful when you select one. &nbsp;Your archetype should attempt to compliment your role as much as possible, as you can do a lot, but your archetype needs to help you do it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c11 c3">Archetypes</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4 c13">Arsenal Chaplain (****)</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">The most offensive route you can take, this archetype thankfully doesn&rsquo;t drop any feats and opens up quite a few with weapon training. &nbsp;The sacred weapon loss is pretty saddening, but overall if you&rsquo;re going for a heavy weapon smash mouth style, this is the way to go.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">1st </span><span class="c3 c7">War Blessing (***)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">War&rsquo;s blessing is pretty solid, so this isn&rsquo;t too bad a blessing to be locked into. &nbsp;Losing your second blessing hurts (no trading it for a divine fighting technique), but I don&rsquo;t mind the loss of Sacred Armor too much, as it felt like a fun throw in ability instead of something vital to the role. &nbsp;While not recommended for tanks due to that reason, the versatility of being able to pass out your blessing can make your entire party that much more dangerous, as war has a very nice blessing. &nbsp;Overall, it&rsquo;s a solid upgrade to me.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">1st </span><span class="c3 c8">Sacred Weapon (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A hard drop to your scaling damage removes this from some builds like two weapon fighting and such, not a great loss to take.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">5th </span><span class="c3 c16">Weapon Training (*****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Weapon training is now an awesome thing to receive, and you could even pump it by taking the VMC for fighter to boost the value. &nbsp;Picking up some gloves of dueling to boost your bonus becomes mandatory, but taking an advanced weapon training with all of this can lead to a huge boost in your battle potential.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Champion of the Faith</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">So this is your faux paladin, and the cost to be a &lsquo;paladin of any alignment&rsquo; is to lose a lot of what made you good. &nbsp;Personally I think you&rsquo;re better off going paladin unless you completely refuse to play lawful good, but if that&rsquo;s the case, you can be a &lsquo;paladin&rsquo; like this, although needing charisma is a damn shame.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">1st Chosen Alignment (?)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;So probably go good/evil depending on the game, not a lot to rate here.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">1st </span><span class="c3 c12">Sacred Weapon (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is a huge drop in your power and really a massive downgrade.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">3rd </span><span class="c3 c8">Detect Alignment (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;I think I&rsquo;d rather have the bonus feat rather than this faux paladin feature.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">4th </span><span class="c3 c7">Smite (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;So since you probably tanked your charisma (or you&rsquo;re making yourself MAD), this won&rsquo;t give a great bonus to your attack rolls or AC, although it&rsquo;s a healthy damage boost.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Cult Leader (***)</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">I&rsquo;d say this is about a straight trade, you become less of a brawler and more of a sneaky character. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re taking it, you want more skills and to be a sneak, as more combat focused warpriest can skip over this archetype, but sneak attack with dual wielding can be a powerful tool for you.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">1st </span><span class="c3 c4">Skill List (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You needed more skills and skill points desperately, you will appreciate this.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">1st </span><span class="c3 c8">Weapon and Armor proficiencies (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Losing weapon focus probably hurts the most here if you didn&rsquo;t have a deity with a nice favored weapon. &nbsp;Not a huge loss aside from weapon focus, but not a great one either.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">1st </span><span class="c3 c12">Well Hidden (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This isn&rsquo;t worth weapon focus, it&rsquo;s basically trading it for a skill feat.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">3rd </span><span class="c3 c7">Sneak Attack (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Losing your bonus feats hurts a lot unless you&rsquo;re taking a favored class bonus to get more, but the additional sneak attack damage is actually pretty substantial, and you still have scaling weapon damage to make dual wielding viable, so this is a decently even trade.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">4th </span><span class="c3 c7">Enthrall (***)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Your channel energy wasn&rsquo;t great, trading it for something like this is a fair deal.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">12th </span><span class="c3 c7">Hide in Plain Sight</span><span class="c5 c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c7">(***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;About up to par with your combat feat at this level, but if you&rsquo;re going for a sneaker, this probably just barely pulls ahead.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c12">Disenchanter (*)</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">Oh wow, I can&rsquo;t think of any roll this helps. &nbsp;Your bonus feats suck, you can give a bonus to saves for allies, but it&rsquo;s a standard action when you&rsquo;re a beast of manipulating the action economy, and you lose your 6th level feat for something that isn&rsquo;t worth the fervor. &nbsp;While we&rsquo;re here, you should really check out Gurren Lagann, it&rsquo;s a fun show that has a very &lsquo;shonen&rsquo; feel to it but also keeps you interested with a very hype plot.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">3rd </span><span class="c3 c12">Bonus Feats (*)</span><span class="c5 c12">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">This is a terrible list. &nbsp;Boo this list!</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">4th </span><span class="c3 c12">Mystic Interference (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t much care for channel, but it&rsquo;s a way better use of a standard action than this. &nbsp;Boo this ability! &nbsp;Gurren Lagann&rsquo;s characters are also very enjoyable, hard not to find a favorite fast.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">6th </span><span class="c3 c12">Banish Enchantment (*)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Or you could...just prepare </span><span class="c0">dispel magic</span><span class="c2">. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s on your list, you get it one level later, doesn&rsquo;t burn fervor. &nbsp;In the second half of the show it has a really cool tone shift, I really liked it. &nbsp;I think if you give the show a chance, it&rsquo;ll really charm you into enjoying it like it did with me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c7">Divine Commander (***)</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">Just barely green, this feels like a painful route to take just to get a mount. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re losing a lot of feats and not getting things you especially care about in return, although eventually you will get a decent pay off for the teamwork feats, and it&rsquo;ll work even better if your party members already take those teamwork feats. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">1st </span><span class="c3 c7">Mount (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Losing blessing isn&rsquo;t great, but a mount is. &nbsp;For some reason you lose share spells (thanks, cavalier) but light armor prof isn&rsquo;t a bad consolation. &nbsp;All in all, it&rsquo;ll change your style of combat a lot, but it&rsquo;s really worth it to get a battle ready mount to carry out through combat.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">3rd </span><span class="c3 c8">Battle Tactician (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;So more cavalier stuff, this isn&rsquo;t worth your bonus feat, but it&rsquo;s an early bonus feat, so losing it won&rsquo;t ruin your set up, only delay it.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">6th </span><span class="c3 c7">Blessed Mount (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Losing this bonus feat hurts more, but getting a more battle ready (and thematic) mount is worth it, helping your mount survive the elements much better.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">12th </span><span class="c3 c7">Greater Battle Tactician (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Again, not a feat you want to lose, but dropping the requirement to a swift action can actually make it viable for in battle use, so probably just a little weaker than the feat.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">15 </span><span class="c3 c12">Bless Army (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Considering not everyone uses mass combat rules, including it as an ability in an archetype is really poor form. &nbsp;Maybe it&rsquo;s good, but it shouldn&rsquo;t have been here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c8">Forgepriest (**)</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Almost green, the amount of early game battle prowess you have to give up in order to make this work is too hard of a sell for me. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re crafting, it&rsquo;s pretty nice, but losing both your 3rd and 6th level feat really puts you behind the curve in terms of how dangerous you can be.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">1st </span><span class="c3 c8">Blessings (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Losing the blessings for some meh spells, at least you&rsquo;re getting something.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">1st </span><span class="c3 c7">Smith&rsquo;s Spells (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is a decent list of spells, thematic and useful in and out of combat.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">2nd </span><span class="c3 c8">Forge Mastery (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a healthy skill bonus, but not worth a blessing.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">3rd </span><span class="c3 c7">Bonus Feats (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;New options are nice, glad it isn&rsquo;t a replacement list.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">3rd </span><span class="c3 c7">Craft Magic Arms and Armor (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re taking this archetype, you want to craft, so getting this just a little early is worth losing your first bonus feat, which really is your best one to lose.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">4th </span><span class="c3 c8">Creator&rsquo;s Bond (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Channel energy isn&rsquo;t great, but it&rsquo;s a better use of fervor than this.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">6th </span><span class="c3 c8">Heat of the Forge (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Not a great feat to lose, even with how common fire damage is.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c7">Liberty&rsquo;s Blade (***)</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">So you lose a blessing and get a slightly weaker but helpful channel ability to fight devils better. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m going to be nice and rate it for general use assuming there&rsquo;s some devils in your game, although it goes up a color and a half (to blurple) in a devil themed game, as bane is powerful as hell when it works right.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">1st </span><span class="c3 c8">Liberty&rsquo;s Focus (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The first one isn&rsquo;t too hard, but losing a blessing and having a forced blessing isn&rsquo;t a great start. &nbsp;Liberations a decent blessing, so it&rsquo;s not too hard a loss though.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">4th </span><span class="c3 c7">Devilslayer (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Another option is never bad, although it&rsquo;s pretty campaign specific.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">4th </span><span class="c3 c7">Channel Liberty (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s pretty situational but helpful in that situation, and weakening the healing of an already weak healing ability doesn&rsquo;t bode well, hope you&rsquo;re fighting a lot of devils.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">7th </span><span class="c3 c7">Devil Defiant (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Another bonus ability, also specific.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c7">Mantis Zealot (***)</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Worse sneak attack and skill list than cult leader but all of the bonus feats intact. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s an interesting choice, and both are fair options. &nbsp;Personally, I like this one slightly more, but it comes down to what you&rsquo;re looking to do with the class, as well as coming with some fun ingrained flavor.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">1st Mantis Sworn (?)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Can&rsquo;t really rate this, seems pretty evil though.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">1st </span><span class="c3 c8">Weapon and Armor proficiencies (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A fair enough trade, an exotic blade for shields seems fair.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">1st </span><span class="c3 c7">Sneak Attack (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Sacred weapon was nice, you&rsquo;re paying for your weapons now. &nbsp;But you are getting a decent scaling sneak attack, so it&rsquo;s about an even trade with less resource management.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">7th </span><span class="c3 c8">Sacred Reflexes (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;And buying your own armor too. &nbsp;I like this one less due to the duration as you need to be aware you&rsquo;re getting into combat to use it.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">20th </span><span class="c3 c7">Aspect of the Mantis (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Fair enough trade, aspect of war was pretty meh anyways.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><h3 class="c6" id="h.w9cnlaofuc3n"><span class="c13 c3 c7">Proselytizer (***)</span></h3><p class="c6"><span class="c5">I&rsquo;m not sure how conversion really works, so it&rsquo;s hard to comment on that. &nbsp;But emotional appeal has a nice enough spell list (</span><span class="c0">HEROISM</span><span class="c5">) to validate this being green. &nbsp;More of a social character, it&rsquo;s not a huge shift in your play style and works well for a vigilant warpriest who&rsquo;s anxious to bring others into their fold.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">1st </span><span class="c3 c8">Weapon and Armor proficiencies (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Not a huge loss, but heavy armor was nice. &nbsp;Hurts more if your deity has a weak favored weapon.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">1st </span><span class="c3 c7">Emotional Appeal (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;There&rsquo;s quite a few good spells in here, we&rsquo;re only losing our first bonus feat and sacred armor, and sacred armor is probably the lesser of your sacred abilities. &nbsp;A net gain overall.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">1st </span><span class="c3 c8">Sacred Subdual (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Limiting you to sudual damage isn&rsquo;t great, really limits your targets.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">1st Blessing of Conversion (?)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know where this is, can&rsquo;t really rate it, seems situational though.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">10th </span><span class="c3 c7">Voice of the Faithful (***)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s an added ability that can be useful, doesn&rsquo;t remove anything, seems good.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c7">Sacred Fist (***)</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">If you want to fight like a monk but you want all of the other things that go along with being a monk, this is the way to do it. &nbsp;Stronger in some ways, flurry&rsquo;s basically getting a slightly better jump on the two weapon fighting chain, but without access to some of the other things that are a part of it. &nbsp;Still, you&rsquo;ll make a pretty solid unarmed combatant with the right feat choice.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">1st </span><span class="c3 c4">Class Skills (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A solid upgrade on your normal skill list, no doubt.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">1st </span><span class="c3 c8">Weapon and Armor proficiencies (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You&rsquo;ll be less tanky, but monk weapons aren&rsquo;t as bad now. &nbsp;Still, none of the great monk weapons are in this list. &nbsp;Still, armor loss isn&rsquo;t great here.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">1st </span><span class="c3 c7">AC bonus (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Overall you&rsquo;ll probably end up with lower AC, but you&rsquo;ll also end up with higher touch AC and CMD, so it&rsquo;s a trade off.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">1st </span><span class="c3 c7">Flurry of Blows (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;About an even trade off, although not getting an improved BAB for this is a real shot to the face. &nbsp;It is give you the two weapon fighting feats for free effectively. &nbsp;Seriously consider the Crusader&rsquo;s Flurry feat with this if your deity has a nice favored weapon, as flurrying with a greatsword is pretty nice.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">1st </span><span class="c3 c7">Unarmed Strike (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You get scaling damage, but only for your fist, which you&rsquo;re expected to use. &nbsp;Not bad, but shame you can&rsquo;t scale with other monk weapons, as well as losing weapon focus.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">3rd </span><span class="c3 c7">Blessed Fortitude (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;As discussed before, this is the feat most easily lost, and getting to avoid effects on a passed save can be nice, as some fortitude saves are nasty even on a successful save.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">6th </span><span class="c3 c7">Bonus Style Feat (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Forcing a style isn&rsquo;t great, nor is needing to meet the prereqs, but counting your warpriest level as your monk level will help here. &nbsp;Overall, a fair enough trade.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">7th</span><span class="c3 c4">&nbsp;Ki Pool (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;I consider this an upgrade, but now you have yet another thing fighting for your swift action. &nbsp;Still, burning a swift action for an additional attack is a very nice use of said swift action.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">9th </span><span class="c3 c8">Miraculous Fortitude (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;So improved evasion for fortitude. &nbsp;Again, you&rsquo;ll probably be saving against these effects, so losing a pretty good feat for yourself here isn&rsquo;t a great trade.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><a id="id.v6wlxwnivq30"></a><p class="c6"><span class="c11 c3 c14 c18 c20">Multiclassing</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">As a caster and with variant multiclassing being so good for the warpriest, I&rsquo;m not really a huge fan of multiclassing. &nbsp;Really, the furthest I would dip anything would be 1 to 2 levels in something due to not wanting to lose progression on things like bonus feats, as you only get faux BAB and fighter levels for warpriest levels. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re going to dip, make it short and sweet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c3 c14 c18 c20"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c17">Variant Multiclassing</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">You have a lot of feats to play with, so paying some of your mundane feats to grab a few new abilities from other classes. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll be picking these up slowly as you level, so make sure and be patient with it, as eventually you&rsquo;ll gain some pretty nice things from your &lsquo;faux&rsquo; multiclass.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Core</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Barbarian (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;An early boost, remember that you can&rsquo;t cast while raging. &nbsp;But you can swiftcast and THEN rage as a free action as long as you get your best buffs up first. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d probably say use unchained rage for this to make it easier, but your rage rounds will eventually get to a pretty nice point, and the other features like snagging rage powers can really help stretch your versatility and make you even more dangerous.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Bard (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Your charisma probably won&rsquo;t be that great and you can&rsquo;t ever use bardic performance faster than a standard action, but with things like lingering performance, you can extend your inspire courage for long enough to last through most combats. &nbsp;A decent combination with Champion of the faith for Charisma dependency.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c16">Cleric (*****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Oh wow, if you wanted to make a brutal bad touch warpriest, you can actually pull it off. &nbsp;Using the same tools as with the bad touch cleric, you have more accuracy and a ton of feats to take things like channel smite, domain strike, and all the other staples that make this such a brutal style of combat. &nbsp;Extra channels are just icing on the cake, free healing/harming for when you need it. &nbsp;This VMC is basically its own style of play, and should be treated as such.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Druid (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Not wearing metal armor hurts, but this is your way to an animal companion that can straight up maul things, even if you have to wait until 11th level for have it hit full potential. &nbsp;Wild shape comes in late, but it can give you some fun options to play around with, making it a nice late ability.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Fighter (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While bravery has and will always be garbage, we&rsquo;re here to pick up armor training (which hopefully will get a buff) and weapon training which is already a powerful feature now. &nbsp;Just having access to it will let us use gloves of dueling to boost the power of it, and make an arsenal chaplan even more powerful.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Monk (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Nothing here is worth it as you need armor. &nbsp;If you wanted something like this, go sacred fist.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Paladin (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You only need to be good, which is nice. &nbsp;Me personally, I find lay on hands to be the big sell here, helping you tank better without needing to burn your fervor for self healing. &nbsp;The smite is okay (mostly just a damage boost since you&rsquo;ll probably have trash Charisma), so take this if you want to stay standing.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Ranger (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Unless you really want favored enemy for a feat or something, this is a pretty bland VMC.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Rogue (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;I&rsquo;d consider this more for a mantis zealot due to the amount of feats they have to burn as opposed to a cult leader. &nbsp;More sneak attack is nice, and it&rsquo;ll help you fill the sneak role more easily.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Sorcerer (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;There is some strong bloodline abilities worth stealing here, and this is basically an easier way of getting the eldritch heritage feats without dealing with a charisma prereq.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Wizard (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The familiar is a great grab here and there&rsquo;s quite a few decent school powers worth checking out &nbsp;and a free cantrip isn&rsquo;t that bad either.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">Base</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Alchemist (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You&rsquo;re really just here for mutagen as your bombs aren&rsquo;t anything special.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Cavalier (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You can pick from a few decent orders, although challenge probably won&rsquo;t be too useful to you unless you pick up extra challenge or chain challenge.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Gunslinger (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;No dex to damage, no dice.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Inquisitor (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Solid for intimidation builds, there&rsquo;s a decent amount of extra damage you can do with judgements, and extra judgement is a solid feat to pick up here. &nbsp;Solo tactics can also help make some teamwork feats more worthwhile, and pairs great with divine commander&rsquo;s bonus teamwork feats.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Magus (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Arcane pool is probably the best feature here, especially if you traded away sacred weapon&rsquo;s ability to enhance your weapon. &nbsp;Things like flamboyant arcana are also very nice choices for your arcana too, although spellstrike will rarely benefit you sadly unless you take the broad study arcana.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Oracle (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The curse is flavorful and revelations can be powerful things to have, and you&rsquo;ll be getting quite a bit of them with this VMC.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Summoner (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t be a garbage summoner.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Witch (***)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Another possible bad touch warpriest, with hex strike you can channel your hex into your fist to deliver it along with an unarmed strike or just use a conductive weapon, although your hex DCs are based off intelligence making you more mad and locked into a lower level for a while.</span></p><a id="id.6e61hh9ppjor"></a><p class="c6"><span class="c11 c3 c14 c18 c20">Prestige Classes</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Bet you thought these were gone, didn&rsquo;t you? &nbsp;Understandable, most people aren&rsquo;t big on prestige classes, but there&rsquo;s a few you should check out to get the most out of your warpriest. &nbsp;I doubt you&rsquo;ll be staying in them for the entire duration (although at least one you should), but I&rsquo;m going to try to pick out prestige classes that only lose 1 or less caster levels and have a 3/4ths BAB progression. &nbsp;Remember, you don&rsquo;t get fake fighter level or BAB from prestige classes with your bonus feats, so be careful when taking feats to check their prereqs.</span></p><p

</span><span class="c3 c7">Eschew Materials (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Not needing a holy symbol probably won&rsquo;t be relevant by this level, but it&rsquo;s still a nice throw in to the class.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">2nd </span><span class="c3 c7">Secret Caster (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Something else that&rsquo;ll help you stay hidden, being able to cast

and the BAB is what we&rsquo;re used to, but picking up 6 skill points a level with the class features is a sneak&rsquo;s dream! &nbsp;Only have a good reflex save though is a tough pill to swallow though.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">1st Obedience (?)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Follow your obedience, just do it.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">1st </span><span class="c3

this class are a straight buff. &nbsp;Effectively, you lose 1 spellcasting level and 1 BAB (and your good fort and will save) to get everything this class has as a bonus. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a very fair trade, but that&rsquo;s decently steep since your saves will take a solid hit while you&rsquo;re taking this prestige class. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s probably a good option for sneaks and such just due to the massive skill bump though. &nbsp;You will miss out on favored class bonuses though, which for those of you getting bonus feats is a big loss.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">2nd</span><span

cause. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ll be losing 1 BAB here too (2 BAB if you stay in until 4th level), but we get some nice skills and the saves are decent for our dip but worse for 4 level dip. &nbsp;Besides,

to dull the reason we&rsquo;re here.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">2nd </span><span class="c3 c16">Energy Drain (*****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Now this is why we came. &nbsp;First of all, you&rsquo;re gaining stacking temporary hit points from this which will only make you harder to take down. &nbsp;But really, the best strategy for this is to use it with a conductive melee weapon. &nbsp;As a supernatural ability that requires a melee touch attack, it qualifies, which means you can make 1 attack a round that drinks souls , meaning you can straight up REND through a person&rsquo;s soul very easily. Seriously, this is brutal and an amazing way to go for the bad touch build in the most straight up evil and hardcore way imaginable. &nbsp;And it only gets better with our next class feature.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">2nd </span><span class="c3 c16">Soul Pool (*****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Now we&rsquo;re not even just drinking souls, we&rsquo;re gaining additional benefits. &nbsp;We can use these points for item creation (combined with the soul gems our familiar makes can involve getting a TON of free low cost magic items), recharge staffs (remember, staves use your ability scores to determine DCs, this can allow you to have a favorite staff as long as you have enough soul points to recharge it), free pearls of power (amazing for your level 1 slots, decent for level 2 slots, and difficult but eventually possible for level 3 slots), and these points never disappear. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s on top of the benefits that you&rsquo;re already getting from energy drain granting you temporary hit points. &nbsp;Seriously, this is silly good, and you could leave, here, or stay two more levels to buff your soul pool by 1 and get the following benefits.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">3rd </span><span class="c3 c7">Summon Cacodaemon (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Not exactly battle ready, the best use for these is to snag more soul gems since a cacodaemon can only make a soul gem once a day. &nbsp;Getting up to 3 extra gems can help you build items faster or just heal quicker, but it&rsquo;s a solid use of your time.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">4th </span><span class="c3 c4">Lesser Oblivion (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Immunity to either poison, aging and affects that give penalties to strength or con, bleeding and effects that give penalties to strength, or ingested/inhaled poisons and no longer needing to eat are some damn good benefits. &nbsp;Is it worth staying in to get them?

class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Kukri (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Your TWF weapon of choice, the crit range as well as sacred weapon buffing your damage will turn you into a storm of blades, making you very dangerous in melee.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Light Hammer (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Another throwing weapon option, decent distance and bludgeoning damage is nice.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Light Shield (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A decent offhand weapon, dual wielding light shields is also entirely viable as well. &nbsp;Sacred weapon keeps your damage competitive, and with all the shield feats out there, you can really make TWF with shields a very viable option even if some people think it looks silly. &nbsp;Spikes sadly don&rsquo;t help though, skip them.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Sap (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Your first nonlethal option, good for sneaks going the knockout route.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Spiked Armor (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Again, not a primary weapon, but more options is always good.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Starknife (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A better throwing distance than the dagger but worse crit range, a hard call on thrown weapons here. &nbsp;It does look a lot cooler though, so points for that.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">-One Hand-</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Combat Scabbard, Sharpened (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A decent weapon in its own right and a solid surprise weapon.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Cutlass (***)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Basically a scimitar with less options.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Double Chicken Saber (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A nice enough one hander for monks, can be two handed if needed.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Heavy Shield (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Without the shield trained trait, this is pretty bad. &nbsp;The only advantage it has over the light shield is +1 AC, which isn&rsquo;t good enough to validate the trait required to make this work. &nbsp;Same issue with spiked.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Longsword (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The old reliable, this standard weapon has a few things that make it stand out, but not enough to really wow me, meaning that it&rsquo;ll probably end up as just an okay option.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Rapier (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Nice crit range is fun, but the real joy here is taking fencing grace to get dex to damage instead of strength. &nbsp;Aside from that it&rsquo;s still a great crit weapon, easily top tier.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Scimitar (****)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">The slashing rapier, this instead requires dervish dance to get the same results.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Sword Cane (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The DC to find out it&rsquo;s a weapon is criminally low, it&rsquo;s not worth investing in.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">-Two Hand-</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Bardiche</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c7">Bec de Corbin (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Essentially the same weapon, the decision here is if you want a 3x crit with the bec de corbin or 19-20 crit range with the bardiche. &nbsp;Me personally, I&rsquo;d go with the bardiche, I like critting.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Earthbreaker (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A nice big damage die will do great for vital strike builds, and bludgeoning damage is aces.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Falchion (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;My favorite martial weapon, the high crit rate is better for people making more than 1 swing, really benefiting cleaving as it raises the chances of dropping opponents you normally wouldn&rsquo;t.</span></p><p class="c6"><span

that are nearly identical, it&rsquo;s worth deciding what you want out of theses. &nbsp;My preferred pick is the guisarme for a trip weapon, but each have only minor differences, making your choice more personal than anything.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Greataxe (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Another big damage die for vital strike, this weapon is very swingy in how it deals damage.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Greatsword (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;With a lot of support, the greatsword is amazing for most builds and stands alone in vital strike builds with the greatsword battler divine fighting technique, making it incredibly powerful.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Halberd (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;For those who want a non reach polearm, coming with trip is a nice benefit.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Heavy Flail (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;I really like this as both a 19-20 crit weapon and as a trip weapon.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Lucerne Hammer (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A reach d12 damage die weapon is certainly very nice.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Nodachi (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A slightly stronger falchion here with brace thrown in makes this a strong primary weapon.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Sansetsukon (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The best 2 handed monk weapon, treat it well.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Sarissa (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While 15 ft. range is nice, the limited mobility really hurt this weapon.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Scythe (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;An old standby, that 4x crit is great when you&rsquo;re working to maximize it.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Syringe Spear (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You yourself can&rsquo;t make the best use of this, but in a team it can be nice.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">-Ranged-</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Chakram (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A very nice distance for thrown weapons,

class="c2">&nbsp;The only difference in the end is more range for the longbow vs. being able to use this on horseback for the shortbow, both are exemplary otherwise.</span></p><p class="c1"><span

nice.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">(Scorpion) Whip (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;With the whip feats that are already out, the whip is a very viable weapon for both battlefield control and normal battling, although it does take quite an investment to use to its fullest.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">-One Hand-</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3

(**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This has no real special use, so it&rsquo;s just...average.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Dwarven Double Axe (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;For cleave specialist, it&rsquo;s a +1 to most extra attacks you&rsquo;re getting.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Estoc (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Basically a better rapier, but it&rsquo;s also exotic.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Falcata (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A very interesting weapon, it&rsquo;s the only one in the game with a 19-20/x3 crit range, making it a nice choice for certain builds.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Sawtooth Sabre (***)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">While it&rsquo;s initially a step up from kuris, the scaling damage makes this an okay choice.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Temple Sword (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The best 1 handed weapon for monks.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">-Two Hand-</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Battle Ladder (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s terrible, but you need to find a god who uses this because it&rsquo;s also silly awesome.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Bladed Scarf (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A nice surprise weapon, but aside from that it&rsquo;s meh.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Double Chained Kama (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is probably the closest thing we have to a reach and adjacent weapon in the game, and with the scaling damage, this becomes a very viable option, although being able to make only a single reach attack makes this more of a vital striker&rsquo;s weapon.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Elven Branch Spear (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;With some neat tricks, it&rsquo;s a pretty dextrous weapon, better for elves who get it for free. &nbsp;Sadly I can&rsquo;t see a way to get dex to damage with this, maybe effortless lace and agile weapon property?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Elven Curved Blade (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A finessable nodachi, good for those looking for something like that.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Fauchard (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;My fav exotic reach weapon, the crit range is huge and it&rsquo;s a trip weapon, what&rsquo;s not to love?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Kusarigama (?)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This reads like a reach/adjacent weapon, but there&rsquo;s still no clear ruling.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Meteor Hammer (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;An interesting switch weapon, it&rsquo;ll help keep opponents on their toes with you.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Piston Maul (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While you need a thunderstone every day to make it work, +4 damage is a large amount.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Ripsaw Glaive (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;An amusing weapon, it&rsquo;s rare you&rsquo;ll get a chance to rev it

class="c2">&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t normally like crossbows, but with the crossbow mastery feat, you can reload this as a free action, and fire both bolts at once. &nbsp;The scaling damage for both bolts is only going to help you out, basically increasing vital strike damage by 1 step instantly. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s a bit of an attack penalty for this, but if you can wait until 6th level to wield this, it&rsquo;s an amazing ranged weapon. &nbsp;The normal version isn&rsquo;t as good, comes with a larger penalty to attack, and you can only really make great use of it with vital strike due to the move action reload, but it&rsquo;s still a decent ranged vital strike option.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Firearms (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You can&rsquo;t make these

hardness. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d consider getting a weapon intended for breaking things if you want to smash through walls though, as some GMs won&rsquo;t just let you hack through stone with a sword.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Alchemical Silver (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is only really worth it for bludgeoning weapons, as the damage bonus isn&rsquo;t worth the cost for this. &nbsp;Besides, there&rsquo;s a better version of this we can get.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Bloodcrystal (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A small bonus on damage against bleeding creatures is very low priority.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Cold Iron (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Really only good for getting through specific DR, nothing amazing.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Elysium Bronze (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Good for natural games, it&rsquo;s like a slightly more janky favored enemy against

last for long enough to be viable.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Horacalum (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While it is expensive, it&rsquo;s also a +1 circumstance bonus to attack, nice for stacking.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Inubrix (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Due to how sacred weapon works, I&rsquo;m not even sure you&rsquo;ll suffer a drawback here for the decreased weapon die size, and the benefit of ignoring all iron and steel armor and shields can be massive against humanoid opponents. &nbsp;The cost isn&rsquo;t even that bad for a bonus this nice, but the constant faux broken condition makes it only suitable for 20/x2 crit weapons, making them far more useful for this special material.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Noqual (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A situational bonus against undead and constructs made by spells, it&rsquo;s not too costly.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Silversheen (***)</span><span

but since you have so many ways of fighting, looking over all of the options is a good call to make sure you&rsquo;re getting everything you can possibly have. &nbsp;Really, armor&rsquo;s an easier selection here, as you just need to go with what fits your dex bonus while giving you the best possible defense, although for some of you, your armor check penalty will come into play with certain

armor, as well as another set of enhancements to be switched on and off at your leisure.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Haramaki + Armored Kilt (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;For those of you who have high dex bonuses, this combination has no max dex bonus and a +2 armor bonus, counting as medium armor for movement. &nbsp;While you probably won&rsquo;t hit dex cap, for those of you who really want to focus, this is a strong combination.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Kikko (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The middle ground of chain shirt and breastplate,

store some enhancements too.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Heavy Shield (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The added protection isn&rsquo;t generally worth it as an offensive weapon, and not having a hand free makes them weaker defensively.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Light Shield (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Really these should always be weapons too, making them nice for offense and defense, as well as keeping your hand open to cast spells.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Shield Boss, Hooked (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;For a sneak,

an opponent is a nice additional debuff.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Dazzling Radiance (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Even for dazzling display users, a DC 17 save is just trash.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Deadly (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;If you don&rsquo;t already have a way to make a nonlethal weapon do lethal damage, stop using it.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Deceptive (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;As a bonus to feinting it&rsquo;s a nice option, but feinting isn&rsquo;t a great style for you.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Defending (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Just buy armor.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Dispelling (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;For those of you following the dispelling route, this is a very focused but solid option.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Distracting (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Just a terrible way to bother mages, you&rsquo;re better than this.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Dueling (PSFG) (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;For anyone attempting to use combat maneuvers, this is a huge boost (that&rsquo;s also boosted by fate&rsquo;s favored), making for an awesome CMB machine.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Elemental (Acid</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c8">Cold</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c8">Electric</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c8">Fire</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c8">Sonic)</span><span class="c5 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c8">(**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Unless you&rsquo;re going ranged, you&rsquo;re not going to be attempting enough attacks to make these viable, as the additional damage isn&rsquo;t anything to write home about.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Fervent (*)</span><span class="c5 c12">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">For something that sounds like it should work well, this just ends up falling flat.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Fortuitous (***)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">For reach builds, anything that nets you more value from AOOs is solid.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Ghost Touch (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Another very narrow scope for an ability, but boost your damage a lot against incorporeals.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Growing (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While the actual effect is interesting and useful, the once per day stipulation really holds this back since you can&rsquo;t separate out the uses to make this viable for more than an encounter or two. &nbsp;Still, additional damage (I assume it&rsquo;s considered a larger size) and being able to use combat maneuvers on bigger foes is a nice selling point, and for a +1 bonus, you could eventually pick up a few.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c16">GUIDED (*****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You may ask yourself, &ldquo;Ehn, why is this enhancement all in caps?&rdquo; &nbsp;It&rsquo;s because this one (3.5) enhancement completely BREAKS the class. &nbsp;No feat prereq like agile (which is still amazing), and it bases your attack and damage off of your widom. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s right, the entire class can be wisdom dependant for a single +1 enhancement. &nbsp;It doesn&rsquo;t get 1.5 damage on 2 handing, but it also doesn&rsquo;t get .5 damage for offhanding, which makes it amazing for TWF builds. &nbsp;Really, the only minor issue is you don&rsquo;t benefit much from strength boost gotten from spells, but what do you care, your entire character is based off wisdom which is an amazing stat. &nbsp;Seriously, talk to your GM about this one as it&rsquo;s game changing in every sense of the word, an auto inclusion if you can get it. &nbsp;There isn&rsquo;t enough I can say about how amazing this is, not even close.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Hearseeker (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Melee concealment isn&rsquo;t as much of an issue as ranged concealment, so it&rsquo;s weaker in melee.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Keen (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The paid way to pick up improved critical, it&rsquo;s your call which is for you.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Ki Focus (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Kind of an enhancement version of the ascetic style feats, it&rsquo;s worth it if you&rsquo;re monkish.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Leveraging (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Okay for trip builds, duelist beats it most regards though.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Merciful (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Nonlethal with a bonus, I&rsquo;d just go with the blade of mercy trait.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Mighty Cleaving (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;For cleave nuts, you&rsquo;ll probably grow out of needing this before you can afford it.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Mimetic (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Not terrible since a lot of creatures have resistance to elements they use, but the duration is very low, making it situational to get a great value from this.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Pitfall (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;More untyped bonuses to initiative here as the other bonuses are situational at best.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Planar (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Ignoring 5 points of DR from extraplanar creatures is effectively +5 damage against them.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Sacred (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Being a holy symbol is nice, but you won&rsquo;t channel energy enough to take advantage of the other ability from this weapon, sad since it&rsquo;s warpriest specific.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Sapping (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;For nonlethal builds, this is an awesome buff to damage and a possible debuff as well.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Spell Storing (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You have a few decent spells you can store in here, but conductive is a better call.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Vicious (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The added damage is nice, but you don&rsquo;t have the biggest hit die to eat damage like this.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">+2 Enhancements</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Advancing (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Eating a swift action and giving you an attack penalty is not your best friend.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Aligned (Anarchistic</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c7">Axiomatic</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c7">Holy</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c3 c7">Unholy) (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;At its best, this is a solid damage bump that is less narrow than bane, although it&rsquo;s also campaign specific which is best for you.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Anchoring (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Better for a non main weapon, being able to effectively make someone&rsquo;s speed 0 ft. can open up a lot of options, although you effectively lose the weapon with this since you can&rsquo;t move it.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Culling (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;For cleavers, this is your best friend. &nbsp;Seriously, you will need this to reach your full potential.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Defiant (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The ability to get extra uses of heroic defiance can be a huge swing in your survivability.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Dispelling Burst (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Another solid tool in a dispeller&rsquo;s arsenal, it works better with high crit weapons.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Disruption (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The DC is trash, pass.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Elemental Burst (*)</span><span class="c5 c12">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">These were lackluster before needing an upgrade, the upgrade is also terrible.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Furyborn (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While an interesting idea, the build up is too slow for me, making a +2 to your weapon better.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Heretical (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is very campaign specific, but if you&rsquo;re in a game that ends up facing one specific religion, this is basically all purpose bane.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Impact (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t think this will actually alter your weapon&rsquo;s damage, as you&rsquo;re not any larger.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Invigorating (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While I like this for cleavers, culling is just too good to pass up. &nbsp;Most others won&rsquo;t get a large amount of value from this, although it could be good for those using bolstered resistance.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Ki Intensifying (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While the swift action isn&rsquo;t great, tripping someone can be very powerful and boosting the DC for your monk feats also gives a solid boost to your control options.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Lifesurge (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;There&rsquo;s a lot of smaller things in here that are nice, but it really only shines in an undead campaign. &nbsp;Sadly even with the cool options, it&rsquo;s second tier compared to other enhancements.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Negating (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is really just a worse planar enhancement.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Phase Locking (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Dimenional locking someone is a good call, but the duration for this is just too short.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Quaking (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;For trip specialist, this is actually quite nice as you&rsquo;re able to knock a group of people right on their back. &nbsp;The versatility of where you can trip makes this very useful, although blugeoning weapons aren&rsquo;t great for trippers for the msot part, so it&rsquo;ll limit your weapon selection somewhat.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Sharding (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Before ricochet toss, this would have been great. &nbsp;Now, it&rsquo;s slightly overcosted for the benefit.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Wounding (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A nice way to cut someone open, the ability to add more bleed damage is the real sell.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">+3 Enhancements</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Exhausting (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;While a nice bonus for crit fishers, it&rsquo;s too overcosted for also negating crit damage.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Gory (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A decent step up from wounding, but just barely.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Nullifying (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A good set up to casting against a creature, the cost is just a tad high for my liking.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Redeemed (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The bonus to holy just isn&rsquo;t enough to justify the cost here.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Speed (*)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;By the time you get this, you can </span><span class="c0">haste</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;yourself effectively.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Spellstealing (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Another crit fisher bonus, it&rsquo;s not worth the cost.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">+4 Enhancements</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Brilliant Energy (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This was never good.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Dancing (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Quite expensive (especially since I&rsquo;d only nab this on a secondary weapon), but it does open up the chance for more damage without needing to devote much to it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c3 c14"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">+5 Enhancements</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Flying (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A meh upgrade to dancing.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Spell Siphon (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Easily a worse spellstealing.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Vorpal (*)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Do you really think you can make this good?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c3

class="c3 c7">Sniping (Improved) (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Now with this and other things, you can bring it to 0.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">16,875 GP </span><span class="c3 c7">Sniping (Greater) (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Now you can easily get your sniping down to 0 with a few tricks.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">+1 Enhancements</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Conductive (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;On the ranged side of things, there&rsquo;s quite a good deal less to use, making this weaker.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Conserving (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;For cheap warpriest or those using bane arrows, it&rsquo;s a way to make sure you&rsquo;re compensated.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Distance (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;For thrown weapons, this can help out a lot since you have terrible range increments.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Driving (***) </span><span class="c2">While tripping or bullrushing doesn&rsquo;t help you much, it will help out your team a lot.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Seeking (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Cover is all over the place in battle, ignoring it is very nice.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c8">Veering (**)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;I&rsquo;d consider it a slightly worse seeking, not bad to throw both on a weapon.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">+2 Enhancements</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c7">Cyclonic (***)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You know how you hate wind? &nbsp;You don&rsquo;t anymore.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c4">Designating, Lesser (****)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This is a great party buff spell as well as a solid call for switch hitters.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Endless Ammunition (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Since it&rsquo;s just normal ammo, it&rsquo;s rarely going to be useful.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Sniping (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A 15 ft. increase to sneak attack range is not worth your time.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c3 c14">+3 Enhancements</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c12">Sonic Boom (*)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Low sonic damage is not good for a +3
