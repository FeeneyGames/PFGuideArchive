My name is Reduxist and I humbly welcome you to my first ever guide! One of the best ways to get knowledgeable on a certain topic in the game was to read a guide on it and gauge the other reader&rsquo;s opinions on it. In this case, I was intrigued by the domains offered by a few certain faith traits and subsequently miffed that almost no guide offered their two cents on them. This is why I decided to make this guide: to create a foundation for discussion on the traits and to communicate with the Pathfinder community. </span></p><p class="c8 c13"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With many of the other pathfinder related guides floating around the interned, I want to make note of a few specific people. N. Jolly, Meshakhad, Crimson Cadaver have all made wonderful guides that have had a good amount of influence on this guide and I just personally want to give them the shout outs. Comprehensive collections of Pathfinder information such as RPGBot, Broken Zenith&rsquo;s Guide to the Guides, D20PFSRD and The Archive of Nethys have also been a huge help in teaching me about the game in many respects.</span></p><p class="c8 c13"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c8 c26"><span class="c0">As for the grading scheme I will use for this guide, N. Jolly has made several guides utilizing a five star method of grading that made his guides accessible for others with various forms of visual impairment, so a huge bit of kudos to him. That&rsquo;s not to say that Treantmonk&rsquo;s idea with the traditional color isn&rsquo;t good, because it definitely serves its purpose!</span></p><p class="c8 c13"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c0">(*) = A generally bad option, I would heavily recommend against this one</span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c0">(**) = Generally mediocre, but useful if you have a very specific idea of what you want</span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c0">(***) = Good option; Good at its purpose and can mildly help you in other areas</span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c0">(****) = Optimal choice.

Nestled within these three books were a plethora of new subdomains for the Cleric and other domain-using divine casters to utilize. However, there was a catch: in order to gain access to these subdomains, you would have to build your character with a specific faith trait. </span></p><p class="c8 c13"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">For the HS domains, you would need the trait known as... </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c28 c16"><a class="c14" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://archivesofnethys.com/TraitDisplay.aspx?ItemName%3DUrban%2520Acolyte&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611440255979000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2tf_DSvE6GgP4w6-ufgx7m">Urban Acolyte</a></span><span class="c16">: You gain Knowledge (Local) as a class skill, as well as gain access to the following subdomains </span><span class="c15 c17">so long as your deity grants access to its associated domain</span><span class="c19 c17 c32">:</span></p><ul class="c7 lst-kix_ofsvlc85mkh0-0 start"><li class="c8 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c17">Competition,</span></li><li class="c8 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c17">Duels,</span></li><li class="c8 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c17">Education,</span></li><li class="c8 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c17">Espionage,</span></li><li class="c8 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c17">Fortifications,</span></li><li class="c8 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c17">Industry,</span></li><li class="c8 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c17">Legislation,</span></li><li class="c8 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c17">Plague,</span></li><li class="c8 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c17">and Riot</span></li></ul><p class="c8 c13"><span class="c2 c17"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0 c17">The DA subdomains, on the other hand, would require a different trait known as&hellip;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c9"><a class="c14" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.d20pfsrd.com/traits/faith-traits/acolyte-of-apocrypha-faith/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611440255980000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0ilTd-8iuB-tndTqszwfCh">Acolyte of Apocrypha</a></span><span class="c16 c17">: You can select one of the subdomains detailed below, </span><span class="c15 c17">provided the subdomain is associated with your patron deity.</span><span class="c2 c17">&nbsp;In some cases, you can select a subdomain associated with a deity despite that deity not offering the associated domain, and you gain domain powers and domain spells from the associated domain as usual, even though your deity normally doesn&rsquo;t grant access to that domain.</span></p><ul class="c7 lst-kix_qzz7pqcthosl-0 start"><li class="c8 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c17">Alchemy</span></li><li class="c8 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c17">Captivation,</span></li><li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c17">Hubris,</span></li><li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c17">Insect,</span></li><li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c17">Legend,</span></li><li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c17">Lightning,</span></li><li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c17">Medicine,</span></li><li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c17">Monsoon,</span></li><li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c17">Petrification,</span></li><li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c17">Portal,</span></li><li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c17">Rites,</span></li><li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c17">Self-Realization,</span></li><li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c17">Thirst,</span></li><li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c17">Thorns,</span></li><li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c17">and Truth.</span></li></ul><p class="c8"><span class="c0 c17">Finally, KG granted the trait simply known as&hellip;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c9"><a class="c14" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.d20pfsrd.com/traits/race-traits/kobold-faith-kobold/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611440255982000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2--7dL0N6_uN8lsJpdjePw">Kobold Faith</a></span><span class="c16 c17">: You get a bonus to Diplomacy checks when dealing with other kobolds, and </span><span class="c15 c17">if your deity grants the Artifice, Earth, or Trickery domains,</span><span class="c2 c17">&nbsp;you gain access to the following respective subdomains:</span></p><ul class="c7 lst-kix_vpfypv3lrutg-0 start"><li class="c8 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c17">Trap,</span></li><li class="c8 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c17">Radiation,</span></li><li class="c8 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c16 c17">or Ambush.</span></li></ul><p class="c8 c13"><span class="c0 c17"></span></p><p class="c8 c26"><span class="c0">In regards to each traits&rsquo; fine print, I would have to hand the &ldquo;Best RAW&rdquo; ribbon to Urban Acolyte. If you noticed the italicized sections of each trait, Urban Acolyte isn&rsquo;t directly connected to whatever deity you choose to worship. All you need for Urban Acolyte is the god to grant a related domain to the subdomain and the trait itself, and it would be eligible. Acolyte of Apocrypha requires that the god possesses the relevant subdomain. This means that you cannot simply cherry pick your deity and see what synergizes well with them. </span></p><p class="c8 c13"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c8 c26"><span class="c0">In terms of selection of subdomains, Acolyte of Apocrypha&rsquo;s 15 choices are dominant compared to Urban Acolyte&rsquo;s 9. This means that Acolyte of Apocrypha is more versatile in terms of building a character. Granting Knowledge (Local) as a class skill doesn&rsquo;t hurt Urban Acolyte, though.</span></p><p class="c8 c13"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c29">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is worth noting that Kobold Faith is something of an odd duck in the group. It only carries 3 subdomains, but outside of the Ambush subdomain, they have no distinct gods connected to them. That means while you don&rsquo;t have as much of a selection in regards to subdomains, your selection of </span><span class="c18">deities</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is virtually limitless. This means you can cherry pick which gods you want with ease. You still have to be a Kobold, though, unless you take up the Adopted trait as well.</span></p><p class="c8 c13"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever their differences, all traits have a few limitations. First, you cannot pick any or all of them at the same time. The reason behind this is that they are considered faith traits. You cannot take two traits from the same category, even with the Additional Traits feat. Secondly, you can only take one subdomain with each trait. If a deity offers two trait-accessed subdomains, you are going to have to choose one over the other.</span></p><p class="c8 c13"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with all things related to the tabletop, though, make sure that things are okay with your GM first before using these options, especially in regards to Urban Acolyte. The Archive of Nethys listed gods connected to the Urban Acolyte subdomains, so there is a chance that the Acolyte of Apocrypha restrictions might also be ruled the same for Urban Acolyte.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c8 c13"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, they are all excellent options with own individual strengths and weaknesses. With that squared away, let&rsquo;s begin the in-depth analysis of each subdomain, starting with Urban Acolyte&rsquo;s selection!

Better yet, there&rsquo;s no listed limit on how many times you can do it per day, so you can probably do it as many times as you want! Check with your GM first!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Spells:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A strong array of spells (pardon the pun!) that help with physical endeavors: Jump provides a hefty situational bonus to acrobatics checks, while Greater Animal Aspect can give several versatile bonuses. Greater Heroism gives standard bonuses to attack rolls, saves and skill checks while also granting temporary hit points and immunity to fear. Losing Enlarge Person and Stoneskin suck, though. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Verdict: </span><span class="c16">Excellent domain focused around mobility and skill checks.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c11"><a class="c14" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/war-domain/duels-subdomain/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611440255985000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1JoJaEBfWKmsG4cz4O-Owt">Duels</a></span><span class="c10">&nbsp;(****)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Associated Domain: </span><span class="c2">War</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Associated Deities: </span><span class="c2">Besmara, Chaldira, Gorum, Iomedae</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Replacement Ability: </span><span class="c2">Divine Challenge (Su).

Gained at 8th level. Replaces Unity of the Community domain or Remote Viewing of the Knowledge Domain. Whenever roles a natural 1 or 20, you can grant everyone 30 feet near you to roll twice on their next attack roll, ability/skill check or saving throw and take the better roll. Rerolls are unanimously considered powerful, especially when they are as versatile as this. Unfortunately, Teaching Moment comes with a strict time limit of 1 minute (10 rounds) or it is wasted. The limited amount of uses per day do not help.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Spells</span><span class="c2">: Admittedly a mixed bag; Clerics already get Know The Enemy and Circle of Clarity, but they also receive Fox&rsquo;s Cunning and Battlemind Link, which they do not. The latter two are rather good buffs, though, especially Battlemind Link. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Verdict: </span><span class="c16">The replacement ability is great if used well, but very strict in terms of how to use it.

Gained at 1st level. Replaces Lore Keeper of the Knowledge domain or Copycat of the Trickery domain. Create a cover identity whenever you prepare spells. You can get into a lot of shenanigans with some clever applications of this and get away with a lot of things. It is rather self-centered, though.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Spells: </span><span class="c2">None of them are on your spell list! Anonymous Interaction is a good way to cover yourself, albeit redundantly with the Deep Cover ability. Zone of Silence is a good way to prevent eavesdroppers, but tends to be situational otherwise.

All in all, great spells to have for covert affairs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Verdict: </span><span class="c16">I can see this seeing a lot of play in social games where information is key for advancing.

Gained at 8th level. &nbsp;Replaces Dancing Weapon. Grants nearby allies bonuses against fatigue and exhaustion, and makes their weapons bypass hardness. Fatigue and Exhaustion can be annoying sometimes, but not only are they situational, but so is dealing with hardness. Losing the Dancing Weapon ability sucks, too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Spells: </span><span class="c2">Crafter&rsquo;s Fortune and Mage&rsquo;s Magnificent Mansion aren&rsquo;t on your spell list. The former can help if you&rsquo;re the mage that wants to make magic items, and the latter is great for shelter against the elements and broke peasants. Wooden Phalanx is already on your spell list and replaces a spell that isn&rsquo;t.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Verdict: </span><span class="c2">While thematic in its choices, the Industry subdomain seems lackluster and unfocused. If you&rsquo;re building some sort of a fantasy era wood tycoon, though, this might be right up your alley.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c11"><a class="c14" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttp://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo---domains/rune-domain/legislation-subdomain/%26sa%3DU%26ved%3D0ahUKEwjDg-jo0ZPTAhUMyoMKHRzhBcIQFggOMAU%26client%3Dinternal-uds-cse%26usg%3DAFQjCNGGhu5jYvpmSVjGcH6ReIQPjz_LwQ&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611440255990000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2tNPc4yiZqUHELdAR1R0Or">Legislation</a></span><span class="c10">&nbsp;(**)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Associated Domains: </span><span class="c2">Law, Rune</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Associated Deities: </span><span class="c2">Abadar, Asmodeus, Dispater, Lissala, Winlas</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Replacement Ability: </span><span class="c2">Prohibition (Su). Gained at 1st level. Replaces Touch of Law of the Law domain or Blast Rune of the Rune domain. I&rsquo;ll be honest, this can be mean, especially if you&rsquo;re taking the rune domain. It&rsquo;s fitting, too, since you have &#8535; of the deities with this subdomain being Lawful Evil. It only does a weak amount of damage, but applying a condition to it can make for some mild battlefield control capabilities.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">However, it is good for low level games and can cause the GM to consider his moves carefully: should he risk weakening or even killing a minion or sacrifice a potential winning move? While not powerful at higher levels, it can certainly be useful early game.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Spells: </span><span class="c2">Forbid Action and Greater Forbid Action are already on your spell list and replace two spells that aren&rsquo;t. Mass Hold Monster, on the other hand, is a nasty save-or-suck spell. Shame it&rsquo;s so high up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Verdict: </span><span class="c2">Even if the ability did more damage, the fact that you have to apply a certain trigger for it to work, and in such a small amount of time (until your next turn or it expires), means the ability is weak after the early game. The spell list isn&rsquo;t doing Legislation any favors either, being too top ended to be of any use.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c16">Paizo user Kurald Galain did, however, suggest that the subdomain has some strength early level and after some reexamination, I was inclined to agree, granting it another star to its rating.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c11"><a class="c14" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttp://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/evil-domain/plague-subdomain/%26sa%3DU%26ved%3D0ahUKEwjDg-jo0ZPTAhUMyoMKHRzhBcIQFggQMAY%26client%3Dinternal-uds-cse%26usg%3DAFQjCNHVNddPhtPTonSy6pbZjNIjUjLuhA&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611440255991000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3PKvhCeYO5O7wsx8YvqLxq">Plague</a></span><span class="c10">&nbsp;(*)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Associated Domains: </span><span class="c2">Death, Evil</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Associated Deities: </span><span class="c2">Apollyon, Cyth-V&rsquo;Sug, Ghalunder, Urgathoa</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Replacement Ability: </span><span class="c2">Touch of Virulence (Su). Gained at 1st level. &nbsp;Replaces Death&rsquo;s Embrace from the Death domain or Touch of Evil from the Evil domain. If something is sick, it takes damage as if it failed its save against it and removes any onset time for the disease. Now THIS is mean. Not only are causing something to suffer via disease, you are prolonging its suffering by wasting its time with setting up for a disease in the first place. There are better ways to spend a standard action than this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Spells: </span><span class="c2">You already have all of these spells on your spell list! And none of them are really good!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Verdict: </span><span class="c2">My least favorite out of all the Urban Acolyte choices by far.

Gained at 8th level. &nbsp;Replaces Touch of Chaos. Nearby enemy spellcasters have more problems casting spells. Considering how nasty spellcasters can be, this will be useful to have later in the game. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Spells: </span><span class="c2">Confusion and Song of Discord are both excellent ways to take enemies out of a fight, albeit with random consistency. Neither of them are on your spell list. Symbol of Strife is, though.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Verdict: </span><span class="c2">The Riot subdomain is an excellent way to shut down enemy spellcasters. If they are accompanied by any martial type foes, the subdomain spells can cause them to turn on the caster as well. The one problem I have with the subdomain is that they heavily rely on mind affecting effects, which can be resisted. Otherwise, Riot is a solid subdomain.</span></p><p class="c12 c13"><span class="c19 c35"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c23">Acolyte of Apocrypha</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c27 c28"><a class="c14" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/artifice-domain/alchemy-subdomain/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611440255992000&amp;usg=AOvVaw13bQhnrOZMQ_sEY7Qgzqw3">Alchemy</a></span><span class="c27">&nbsp;(****)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Associated Domains: </span><span class="c2">Artifice, Magic</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Associated Deities: </span><span class="c2">Brigh, Haagenti, Norgorber, Orgesh, Qi Zhong</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Replacement Power: </span><span class="c2">Divine Alchemy (Su). Gained at 1st level. &nbsp;Replaces Artificer&rsquo;s Touch for the Artifice Domain or Hand of the Acolyte for the Magic Domain. If you don&rsquo;t have an alchemist in your party, you do now. Even though the ability plants several limitations, such as going up to level 6 spells and limiting the amount of times you can use this ability per day, the fact that you have access to cleric spells still puts you in a very powerful position.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">What makes this even more powerful is the fact that you can possibly apply metamagic feats to the spells you use Divine Alchemy on. Extended or Empowered spells can have plenty of applications on you or your targets, whether they be allies or enemies.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Spells: </span><span class="c2">All of these spells are from the Alchemist spell list, so you&rsquo;re getting stuff you wouldn&rsquo;t have access to otherwise. They&rsquo;re specifically chosen to help you with the Divine Alchemy ability, but they still have some applications outside of Divine Alchemy. Touch Injection can help you put the contents of potions and poisons into targets, and Delayed Effect can have some interesting uses, especially if you have a battle plan and like contingencies.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Verdict: </span><span class="c16">Being based on alchemy, it brings something new to the table for Clerics: the ability to make unique potions without having to use the Craft (Alchemy) skill.

Gained at 8th level. &nbsp;Replaces Charming Smile. Nearby enemies take a big (-5) hit to Perception checks and are easier to fascinate by you. Normally, Clerics don&rsquo;t have access to a lot of spells that can fascinate and since the ability specifically states fascination effects &ldquo;by you&rdquo;, you can&rsquo;t really help the bard that much. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Spells: </span><span class="c2">None of the spells are on your spell list already, so that is a plus.

Summon Nature&rsquo;s Ally VIII would be better if you could choose what you could summon, but 1d3 Goliath Stag Beetles aren&rsquo;t too bad, especially since they&rsquo;re each CR 8.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Verdict:</span><span class="c16">&nbsp;Insect is not a bad subdomain by any means, and in fact has several interesting abilities.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c11"><a class="c14" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/glory-domain/legend-subdomain/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611440255995000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0DxhDp-zcqdKRvQe6jBdm9">Legend</a></span><span class="c10">&nbsp;(***)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Associated Domain: </span><span class="c2">Glory</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Associated Deities: </span><span class="c2">General Susumu, Gorum, Shizuru</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Replacement Power: </span><span class="c2">Witness The Legend (Su). Gained at 8th level. &nbsp;Replaces Divine Presence. As a move action, you shed light like a torch and can expend a use of your Touch of Glory domain ability to add 1d6 to an attack roll, saving throw or skill/ability check. This grows to 1d12 if used to confirm a crit or save against fear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">You also get a bonus feat depending on whether you use the optional hero system of play or not. If you do, you gain Hero&rsquo;s Fortune. If you don&rsquo;t, you get Marked for Glory. Either way, it replaces the channel energy bonus from the Glory domain.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Spells: </span><span class="c2">A mixed bag. Clerics already get Aid and Contagious Zeal, but to not have access to Righteous Vigor and Unshakable Zeal. Righteous Vigor is great for melee Clerics and Unshakeable Zeal is good for shaking negative effects off.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Verdict: </span><span class="c16">It&rsquo;s a solid subdomain with several effects. The spell list is a little shaky, but it has its positives. Races with the favored class bonus of adding uses to your first level domain power are preferred, since Witness The Legend eats up a lot of uses of Touch of Glory.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c11"><a class="c14" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/air-domain/lightning-subdomain/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611440255996000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0XQ17NUp3oF8hWEqipxRl1">Lightning</a></span><span class="c10">&nbsp;(***)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Associated Domain: </span><span class="c2">Air</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Associated Deities: </span><span class="c2">Gozreh, Hei Feng, Rovagug, Rull</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Replacement Power: </span><span class="c2">Lightning Rod (Su). Gained at 8th level. Replaces Electricity Resistance, which is literally painful here as I&rsquo;m about to explain. As a swift action, you can empower any electricity spell you cast as if you had the Empower Spell metamagic feat, with half of the damage being unblockable divine magic. The problem? You take an equal amount of electricity damage that you dealt out, and the extra damage only affects one target, even if there were multiple enemies targeted. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Spells: </span><span class="c2">Low level spells mean that you benefit from them immediately. Shocking Grasp, Flame Blade and Lightning Bolt are all not on your spell list, but Flame Blade has the unique quirk of dealing electricity damage instead of the usual fire.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Verdict: </span><span class="c16">Lightning Rod is a very high risk, high reward power to use, especially with little uses per day. The spells assist in turning Air into a blaster focused domain. Just be sure not to use it on an enemy with electricity immunity.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c11"><a class="c14" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/healing-domain/medicine-subdomain/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611440255997000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3t3HyPIQFdQVVIp1AquDfr">Medicine</a></span><span class="c10">&nbsp;(**)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Associated Domain: </span><span class="c2">Healing</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Associated Deities: </span><span class="c2">Dalenydra, Immonhiel, Irori, Korada, Qi Zhong, Sarenrae</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Replacement Power: </span><span class="c2">Blessed Surgery (Su). Gained at 1st level. &nbsp;Replaces Rebuke Death. Reroll your heal skill twice as a free action and take the better roll. It also reduces the time for healing from 1 hour to 1 minute. Useable several times per day, this can help when you&rsquo;re low on resources.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Spells: </span><span class="c2">Only two, and only Placebo Effect isn&rsquo;t on your spell list. That spell is a good way to suppress negative effects, though.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Verdict: </span><span class="c16">If you&rsquo;re doing a low wealth game, Blessed Surgery will help you out big time, although it can become redundant with the Cleric&rsquo;s spontaneous casting ability. The spells are meh.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c11"><a class="c14" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/weather-domain/monsoon-subdomain/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611440255997000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0zrylRDmD_JECKLxzlY1bV">Monsoon</a></span><span class="c10">&nbsp;(***)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Associated Domain: </span><span class="c2">Weather</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Associated Deities: </span><span class="c2">Daikitsu, Gozreh, Hei Feng, Rull</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Replacement Power: </span><span class="c2">Refreshing Rain (Su). Gained at 8th level. &nbsp;Replaces Lightning Lord. Heals nonlethal damage and removes certain status effects to everyone nearby. Great for after a battle, but be careful who you use it on. The ability does not discriminate between friend or foe. Low uses per day.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Spells: </span><span class="c2">Another mixed bag. Hydraulic Torrent can help with battlefield control, while Tsunami can literally control the battlefield. The other two spells are already on the Cleric spell list.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Verdict: </span><span class="c16">An okay subdomain for support and control Clerics.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c11"><a class="c14" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/earth-domain/petrification-subdomain/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611440255998000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2lIcLeeoehFy6MPkHyscDK">Petrification</a></span><span class="c10">&nbsp;(***)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Associated Domain: </span><span class="c2">Earth</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Associated Deities: </span><span class="c2">Ayrzul, Minderhal, Soralyon, Xoveron</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Replacement Power: </span><span class="c2">Fossil Form (Su). Gained at 1st level. Replaces Acid Dart. You become staggered, and in return you gain hardness and a bonus against petrification until the beginning of your next turn. It has a good amount of uses per day and is a swift action, making it an excellent defensive option. Melee characters won&rsquo;t be able to perform full attacks, however.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Spells: </span><span class="c2">Absolutely amazing. Every option on the list is a spell you don&rsquo;t have. On top of that, you lose Wall of Stone, a spell you already have to get Stoneskin one level earlier. Calcific Touch can stack with other options such as Bestow Curse to remove foes via Dexterity damage. Flesh to Stone is a classic save-or-die, and Statue, while received a level later than wizards, can have several applications for the creative player.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Verdict: </span><span class="c2">Pretty much a straight upgrade for the Earth domain. The presence of save-or-x spells might be a turnoff for some players, but they are still spells that you normally wouldn&rsquo;t have access to. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As with the Legislation subdomain, Paizo user Kurald Galain offered his two cents. They noted that Petrification would be more suited for caster Clerics, since Fossil Form prevents full attacks. I had to take a star away for that reason, but it is still a good option to consider.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c11"><a class="c14" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/travel-domain/portal-subdomain/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611440256000000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0okl-JtPlDN9ibfkXoxWlB">Portal</a></span><span class="c10">&nbsp;(***)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Associated Domain: </span><span class="c2">Travel</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Associated Deities: </span><span class="c2">Abadar, Alseta, Barbatos, Yog-Sogoth</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Replacement Powers: </span><span class="c2">Sacred Threshold and Travel As One. Both are gained at 1st level. Both are (Su). Replaces the base speed increase and Agile Feet powers. Sacred Threshold blesses portals like doors and windows with a touch to make it harder to bust open and grants the first ally to pass through the portal temporary health. Travel As One increases how many people you can bring with you via teleportation spells and grants you temporary health to mitigate any damage you might take while leaving.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Spells: </span><span class="c2">None of them are on your list. Open and Shut can make for some mild funny moments (Make door look closed, lure foe and watch him faceplant into the door). Knock opens locks, especially magical ones. Urban Step links two openings together a la the Portal video games. Teleportation Circle effectively makes a teleportation pad. The spells are mostly bottom ended, so you benefit immediately. Losing Fly and Astral Projection sucks, though.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Verdict: </span><span class="c16">Very good at helping the party move over long distances, although the loss of the bonus base speed and spells kind of hurts.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c11"><a class="c14" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/magic-domain/rites-subdomain/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611440256001000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2RX-WNM4qTG6fBYX4ruuSS">Rites</a></span><span class="c10">&nbsp;(****)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Associated Domain: </span><span class="c2">Magic</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Associated Deities: </span><span class="c2">Abraxas, Asmodeus, Nalinivati, Nethys, Nyarlathotep, Sivanah</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Replacement Power: </span><span class="c2">Enduring Ritual (Su). Gained at 1st level. Replaces Hand of the Acolyte. You can increase the length of a spell as long as it is at least 1 minute/level. It is usable multiple times per day, but scales poorly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Additionally, whenever you use the Permanency spell on a domain spell or cast a spell using costly materials, you reduce the cost of the materials by 20%.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Spells: </span><span class="c2">Sanctify Corpse, you already have, but Permanency and Binding are very strong new additions to your spell list.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Verdict: </span><span class="c16">Enduring Ritual is bound to get a lot of use for extending your spells, especially since it can stack with metamagic feats such as Extend Spell. The cost reduction can also help out immensely, since it doesn&rsquo;t specify whether it only works on the Rites subdomain spells, so other domains can benefit as well.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c11"><a class="c14" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/strength-domain/self-realization-subdomain-madness/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611440256002000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3t6RPMXx6rvKyOVHGFLQmw">Self-Realization</a></span><span class="c10">&nbsp;(****)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Associated Domain: </span><span class="c2">Liberation, Strength</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Associated Deities: </span><span class="c2">Arshea, Falayna, Haagenti, Irori, Kurgess, Shei, Urgathoa</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Replacement Power: </span><span class="c2">Perfected Form (Su). Gained at 1st level. Replaces Liberation of the Liberation domain or Strength Surge of the Strength domain. Grants bonuses against polymorph, petrification, and transmutation effects. If you succeed at against a save of those types while this is up, you gain temporary health and a bonus to attack throws, saves and skill checks. Both effects last for 1 minute. It doesn&rsquo;t say if they&rsquo;re synchronized though, so one might outlast another. Check with your GM.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Spells: </span><span class="c16">SWEET MERCIFUL CRAP, YES. This has to be my favorite subdomain spell list in the game, hands down. Primal Scream is nice for getting rid of status effects, and Transformation turns you into a martial monster, but the real high water mark is the access to Paragon Surge </span><span class="c15">no matter what your actual race is. </span><span class="c2">This spell alone makes the spell list extremely powerful, especially if you pair the subdomain with the Strength domain to get access to Enlarge Person.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Verdict</span><span class="c4">: </span><span class="c16">One of my favorite subdomains in the entire game, for a good reason. The spell list and replacement power make you a nightmare to fight one on one, especially if you build yourself up beforehand.

They replace Sun&rsquo;s Blessing and alter Nimbus of Light. Withering Glare is gained at 1st level, Withering Nimbus is still gained at 8th level. Wilting Glare is essentially Horrid Wilting as a ranged touch attack, dealing nonlethal damage and fatiguing foes. If they&rsquo;re plants or water-based, they take lethal damage and are fatigued for longer. Withering Nimbus specifically affects plants and water creatures instead of undead. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Spells: </span><span class="c2">Cup of Dust is the only new spell on here, but it is a nasty save-or-suck; it causes the foe to dehydrate and take nonlethal damage for days/level until either they lose all their health or the spell wears off. No amount of drinking can stop this. Horrid Wilting is back and is still as unimpressive as ever.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Verdict: </span><span class="c16">If you&rsquo;re going on an aquatic adventure, this subdomain can tear things up.

Usable several times per day.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Spells: </span><span class="c2">All Druid spells, none of them Cleric! Thorn Javelin is a standard temporary melee weapon that also sickens, replacing Entangle.

Wall of Nausea is a decent way to provide some battlefield control and some minor concealment. Contact Other Plane is a good way to gain information, especially since you aren&rsquo;t Intelligence or Charisma dependent like other casters of the spell.

What makes it interesting is that it you can touch any unattended object; it doesn&rsquo;t specify what it might be. It could be as tiny as a vial or as large as a statue, as long as it is unattended.
