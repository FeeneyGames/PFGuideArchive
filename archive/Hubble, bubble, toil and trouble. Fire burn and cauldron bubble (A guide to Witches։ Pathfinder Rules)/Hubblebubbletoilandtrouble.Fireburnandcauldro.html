class="c21"><h1 class="c22" id="h.n83wja7elcbe"><span class="c26">Pathfinder Guide to Witches</span></h1><p class="c7 c12"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Let me start off by saying that Treantmonk has set the industry standard for writing quality class guides and I will be using the same colour coding and asterisks he uses to grade various options. That means:</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c10">Red * </span><span class="c2">-bad option or nearly useless ability</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c8">Orange **</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;-ok option, or useful but only in rare circumstances</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">Green ***</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;-Strong choice</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c15">Blue ****</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;-Must-have</span></p><h2 class="c16" id="h.aucgstqnjr3k"><span class="c9">Introduction</span></h2><p class="c7"><span class="c2">I wrote this guide for two reasons. &nbsp;Nobody else has bothered to write one. &nbsp;Secondly, I like playing witches. &nbsp;For me, they have so much flavour compared to other classes. &nbsp;Who else can vomit a swarm of spiders over your enemies and then cackle about it?</span></p><h2 class="c16" id="h.3n7me3g72a86"><span class="c9">The Roles</span></h2><p class="c7"><span class="c2">The witch class, for my mind, is one class that does not really need to be tied down to any role. &nbsp;They do not suffer from MAD (multiple attribute distribution) syndrome and are quite capable of performing several roles without great sacrifice. &nbsp;If you wanted to lock your witch into a specific role then consider the following:</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.blvs2o72pmrd"><span class="c4">The Buffer / Debuffer</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">The witch has a wide range of hexes and spells that can help buff the party. &nbsp;Hexes include ward which gives a long term saving throw and armour class bonus to a character or the fortune hex which allows re-rolls. &nbsp;The witch also has some buffing spells to offer such as false life, mage armour, enlarge person, heroism are some examples. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">The witch is particulary strong in the debuff department with hexes such as misfortune and evil eye which help undermine their saving throws, armour class, abilities and/or attacks. &nbsp;Then you have hexes such as death curse, agony and forced reincarnation which all do horrible things to your enemy if they fail their saves. &nbsp;There seems to be an endless array of spells to choose for debuffing including pox pustules, bestow curse, blindness / deafness to name just a few. &nbsp;If this is your style then the choice seems almost endless.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.r943hkw75c"><span class="c4">The Support role</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Surprisingly, the witch can fill the bard&rsquo;s shoes most adequately with this role even though the class mechanics of the two are completely different. &nbsp;What they do have in common is that they both have access to an arcane spell list with divine support spells thrown in to make them both extremely versatile. &nbsp;So while the witch has access to many useful arcane spells, they can also use divine spells such as cure wounds spells, find traps, remove disease / blindness / deafness / curses which are all important at various times to the continued success of the party. &nbsp;This means they can also use cure wands and various scrolls which also augments their ability to function in a support role.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.x9q3b9xhojip"><span class="c4">The Battlefield Controller</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">The witch is well suited to this role for although they do not have the same range of spells as a wizard, the spells they can choose from are heavily littered with battlefield control choices. &nbsp;Choices include fog cloud, summon swarm, vomit swarm, glitterdust, sleet storm, stinking cloud, black tentacles, ice storm, solid fog, cloudkill and more. &nbsp;As you can see, you can really go to town with this if this is the flavour you like.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.v18aj1h8i2x9"><span class="c4">Final Thoughts on Roles</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">As I mentioned earlier, the witch does not suffer from MAD and is also not feat starved. &nbsp;So there is no reason why you couldn&rsquo;t create a character that can perform several of these roles if you are so inclined. &nbsp;Because you are a full spellcasting class it&rsquo;s generally not a good idea to multiclass. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">If you do want to venture away from the witch class at later levels, a fellow using the non de plume &ldquo;Abraham Spalding&rdquo; that I had brief discussions with on the pathfinder forums has suggested using prestige classes such as the Loremaster or the Pathfinder Savant. &nbsp;The Loremaster is useful if you want to play the &ldquo;know it all&rdquo; without losing your full spell progression as a witch. &nbsp;The Pathfinder savant is in Seeker of Secrets, and is available for pathfinder society play. &nbsp;The prerequisites include 2nd level spell casting, 5 ranks in a couple of skills and some feats (the feat requirements are changed for PFS). &nbsp;The benefits include 1/2 PrC level on spellcraft, UMD and K(arcana) in addition to being able to take 10 on UMD checks; 1 spell off of any spell list added to your spell list for all but 1 level of the PrC (this spell if not already on your list counts as one spell level higher than it normally would); the ability to use scrolls at your caster level instead of the caster level they are scribed at; and the last ability you would want to choose is swift identify as a spell-like ability twice per day. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Other things to know about the witch are that she can be quite powerful at low to mid levels as her hexes can be so potent that they are sometimes a better option than casting a spell. &nbsp;This is important for although you are a full spellcaster, you don&rsquo;t get bonus spells from specialising or bonus spells from domains and using hexes is a way to avoid using up your spells too quickly. &nbsp;Witches draw a mixed bag when it come to their spell lists. &nbsp;They don&rsquo;t get anywhere near as many spells to pick from as a wizard. &nbsp;However, they do get access to some excellent divine spells so the witch can easily backup as the secondary healer with judicious use of cure wounds spells, healing hexes and wands. &nbsp;Finally, witches are </span><span class="c11">squishy</span><span class="c2">. &nbsp;You do not want to find yourself on the front of the battle line if it can be avoided. &nbsp;You are the controller / buffer / manipulator but you are NOT the fighter. &nbsp;That role is best left to the expendable meatshields in front of you.</span></p><p class="c7 c12"><span class="c2"></span></p><h2 class="c16" id="h.kh6yd28qyygi"><span class="c9">The Ability Scores</span></h2><h4 class="c0" id="h.7t54jfoxdti3"><span class="c6">Strength (Str) *</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Not important. &nbsp;You are not a combatant. &nbsp;This can be a dump stat if you desire.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.cwk549sh0oc8"><span class="c5">Dexterity (Dex) ***</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Somewhat important. &nbsp;Higher reflex saves and higher armour class helps keep you alive.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.31roski3bffo"><span class="c5">Constitution (Con) ***</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Somewhat important. &nbsp;Higher fortitude saves and more hit points helps keep you alive.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.hz0j5dmbngag"><span class="c13 c15">Intelligence (Int) ****</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Vital. &nbsp;This is your primary attribute. &nbsp;It affects your skill points, grants you more spells, and gives you higher DC&rsquo;s for your hexes and spells. &nbsp;Do not skimp on this.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.mc7prjss738"><span class="c13 c8">Wisdom (Wis) **</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Not that important but it does give a bonus to your will saves. &nbsp;Also useful to have for sense motive and perception skills. &nbsp;Not really a dump stat, but you don&rsquo;t need to put any points in it either if you are starved for points.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.xcz15npbkt4"><span class="c6">Charisma (Cha) *</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Potentially another dump stat unless you want to be the face of the party or if you want to boost your UMD skill.</span></p><p class="c7 c12"><span class="c2"></span></p><h2 class="c16" id="h.7u2oz6icu9"><span class="c9">Races</span></h2><h4 class="c0" id="h.gk708b5e1dul"><span class="c13 c8">Dwarf **</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">No bonus to Intelligence is a drawback. &nbsp;The bonus to Constitution is nice and the penalty to Charisma doesn&rsquo;t hurt. &nbsp;Darkvision is an added bonus but this is balanced out by the 20 feet base speed. &nbsp;You want to be able to move quickly to get away from danger being a squishy.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.s7o48grdlywg"><span class="c13 c15">Elf ****</span></h4><h4 class="c0" id="h.s7o48grdlywg-1"><span class="c2">They get a bonus to Intelligence and Dexterity which is great. &nbsp;This is tempered somewhat by the drop in Constitution. &nbsp;Still, that bonus to Intelligence is what really matters. &nbsp;On top of this, low light vision, +2 SR bonus for spellcasting and +2 to perception skill (probably the most important skill in the game) all add up to a first class choice for witches. &nbsp;The Dreamspeaker elven racial alternative trait is also worth considering as it will add +1 to the DC of th</span><span class="c33">eir slumber hexes and it also provides some other nice bonuses.</span></h4><h4 class="c0" id="h.4cc78gsw91z2"><span class="c13 c8">Gnome **</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Again, no intelligence means I can&rsquo;t give this race a strong rating. &nbsp;While the bonus to Constitution helps and the penalty to strength is irrelevant, the race is again hurt by only having a 20 feet base speed. &nbsp;The small size gives a small boost to AC and attack rolls but is not enough to make this more than just an ok option.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.e14zsp5i5muh"><span class="c5">Half Elf ***</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">A good choice as you can put your bonus into Intelligence. &nbsp;I put this racial choice slightly behind Elf and Human because it doesn&rsquo;t get the bonus feat or the +2 SR bonus that elves get. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s not far away from being a blue choice and if you like playing half elves, then don&rsquo;t shy away from this.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.y0sshijg0pw4"><span class="c5">Half Orc ***</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Another choice that is almost blue as again you can put your bonus into Intelligence. &nbsp;The Darkvision and Orc Ferocity are very nice features as well.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.2iqv7siiircp"><span class="c13 c8">Halfling **</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">The lack of Intelligence bonus means that I can only give this race an ok rating. &nbsp;The bonus to Dexterity is nice and the penalty is for a dump stat. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s another race also impacted by being slow but the other features make up for this which include the small bonuses to AC and attack, the bonus to all saving throws and bonus to perception.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.eq6nap9uai3y"><span class="c13 c15">Human ****</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">They tick all the right boxes: bonus to Intelligence, bonus feat, bonus skill points. &nbsp;This all adds up to a first class choice.</span></p><p class="c7 c12"><span class="c2"></span></p><h2 class="c16" id="h.8ux5jq66vzcm"><span class="c9">Skills</span></h2><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Witches only get 2 skill points per level. &nbsp;However, this is going to be boosted by putting your most points into Intelligence (hopefully). &nbsp;This should give you roughly anywhere between 5 and 7 points to play with. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m not going to list every skill. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll just mention a few that are worth considering.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.iyphiyh21ijm"><span class="c13 c8">Craft ** (class skill)</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">This is an ok skill that gets boosted to 4 stars if you take Craft (Alchemy) and pick the Cauldron </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">hex as a focus for your character.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.3k6drye9dei4"><span class="c13 c8">Fly ** (class skill)</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">This is another ok skill that gets boosted to at least 3 stars if you take the Flight hex. &nbsp;Flight hex is a very handy hex that most witches would probably select, so this skill is more likely to be better than ok for you.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.1ou6z6vqishh"><span class="c6">Heal * (class skill)</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">At first glance, you&rsquo;d think this skill deserves higher. &nbsp;However, witches have access to stabilise cantrip, cure wounds spells, and the Healing hexes making this skill redundant.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.qf2y2trh70wt"><span class="c6">Intimidate * (class skill)</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Charisma is pretty much a dump stat for most witches. &nbsp;So unless you are going to put points into Charisma and wish to be the face of the party, this skill isn&rsquo;t going to be much use to you.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.2hhea3xxg9ak"><span class="c5">Knowledge skills ***</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Knowledge skills are always useful to have to garner more information about creatures you have to fight or your environment. &nbsp;Witches are blessed by having several that are class skills including arcana, history, nature, and planes. &nbsp;If you have points to spare, they are not wasted by putting a few into knowledge skills. &nbsp;Even a couple of points in each will give you a decent score with your high intelligence.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.k89tssmyb4b5"><span class="c13 c15">Perception ****</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Unfortunately, this is not a class skill for witches. &nbsp;Nevertheless, this is probably the most important skill in the game. &nbsp;One trick you can use is to rely on the perception of your familiar (especially the Raven who can speak) to warn you of impending danger as they generally have a high skill in this.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.qoetgg98mlns"><span class="c6">Profession * (class skill)</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">This is not really important unless you want it to add flavour to your character.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.9aopn8s86vkn"><span class="c13 c15">Spellcraft **** (class skill)</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">This skill has various uses not the least of which is helping you identify magic loot you find. &nbsp;It also works off your Intelligence so you should be able to get this skill fairly high to increase your chances.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.78l9god509k1"><span class="c13 c15">Use Magic Device **** (class skill)</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">You definitely want this skill as using magic items is part and parcel of being a witch. &nbsp;Maximise skill points into this if possible.</span></p><p class="c7 c12"><span class="c2"></span></p><h2 class="c16" id="h.mpup36rnzib"><span class="c9">Feats</span></h2><p class="c7"><span class="c2">As a squishy spellcaster, combat feats are not going to be much use to you. &nbsp;In fact there&rsquo;s probably only a small pool of feats worth considering unless you are angling for some unusual flavour for your witch. &nbsp;My thanks to Mathwei Ap Niall for including ratings and descriptions for some feats from the Ultimate Magic book.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.6z3n1ufarbgw"><span class="c13 c15">Accursed Hex ****</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">A second chance to affect someone with a hex is needed.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.hx7kalru6j2l"><span class="c13 c8">Combat Casting **</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Not as important to you as for other spellcasters because if you are cornered, you still have hexes as an option which don&rsquo;t generate attacks of opportunity.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.qlnkairyrd2y"><span class="c13 c8">Dodge **</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">This is ok if you have spare feats to spend as witches can&rsquo;t wear armour and every bit helps.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.jmxvkt1hmm5"><span class="c13 c15">Extra Hex ****</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Take this feat and don&rsquo;t be afraid to select it multiple times. &nbsp;The good hex selections are worth more than a feat so every time you select this you are better off. &nbsp;If a feat were a bishop, then a hex is worth a rook.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.8muuzl9n960s"><span class="c13 c15">Improved Initiative ****</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Going first in a round is always a good thing for a witch. &nbsp;If you can get that save or die spell or hex off before the enemy can respond, you&rsquo;re in a strong position.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.xtxdh75n0q2a"><span class="c5">Improved Familiar ***</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">There is nothing wrong with this feat if you want to boost your familiar. &nbsp;This feat gets an extra star moving up from ok because it is so important for witches to keep their familiars alive. &nbsp;They are your living spellbooks and anything that boosts their survivability is a good thing.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.guievwfu9say"><span class="c13 c15">Leadership ****</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">I consider this feat almost broken. &nbsp;It does mean possibly putting a few points in charisma but it gives you your very own meatshield. &nbsp;Your survivability just went up several notches. &nbsp;Check with your games master before selecting this one as they may have some issues with it.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.9c9jq3dye6t5"><span class="c13 c8">Magical Aptitude **</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">A +2 bonus to Spellcraft and UMD is nice but there are probably better options out there for you.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.6eo6dzlrj1m2"><span class="c13 c15">Scribe Scroll ****</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">This is a very handy feat for the witch to pick to ensure she has just the right scroll to get her through a scrap. &nbsp;Get a ring of sustenance and give yourself more downtime when the party rests to scribe some of those emergency backup spells. &nbsp;Keep in mind that while this is free for wizards, you have to buy this feat as a

You disguise yourself like the spell Disguise Self which allows you to change your appearance for an hour per level in hour incremental slots. Pretend to be an important dignitary, a town guard, a jailer, a member of a cult - the list is endless.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.cteufjdf0pzz"><span class="c13 c15">Evil Eye ****</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Wonderful debuff hex that gives a -2 penalty to an ability roll, attack, saving throw, skill check or AC (witch&rsquo;s choice). &nbsp;The beauty of this hex is that it works for one round even if your opponent makes their will save. &nbsp;Combines wonderfully well with Cackle.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.23b4a5trzd8"><span class="c5">Feral Speech *** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">You can speak with animals with some limitations. &nbsp;A solid utility, but still a secondary choice. - light green</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.cteufjdf0pzz-2"><span class="c13 c15">Flight ****</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">By 5th level you have Feather Fall at will; +4 on swim checks; levitate once per day; AND flight 5 times per day at a minute per use.

A typical party of say 5 characters, a familiar and an animal companion would mean 7 uses of a 2nd level spell slot a day for one hex if everyone got injured. Good value.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.dr2pdn3n9549"><span class="c13 c15">Misfortune ****</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Devastating hex which causes a creature within 30 feet to reroll any attack roll, ability check, saving throw or skill check in a round (2 rounds at 8th level) and take the worse roll. The beauty of this hex is combining it with the Cackle hex to extend the misfortune on indefinitely if you keep cackling each round. This hex CAN be combined with Evil Eye on a creature for even more devastation.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.hh5ucw3anoud"><span class="c13 c8">Poison Steep **</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">The synergy with Beguiling Gift is awesome and since it does a pound of items for a day you will ALWAYS have poisoned candies to use (I like raisins myself, a pound of those will go a long way). &nbsp;Solid green if you focus on it as a main tactic otherwise orange.

With the latest FAQ update the Scar Hex has changed from the worst Hex in the game to a required hex after 10th level:</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c28"><a class="c19" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://paizo.com/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1fz%23v5748eaic9oaw&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611440238104000&amp;usg=AOvVaw012OspDeU2tc6v5tlNoFT5">http://paizo.com/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1fz#v5748eaic9oaw</a></span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;With the range addition to the mechanics of this hex and a moments thought this hex now solves the biggest weakness of the class, the 30 foot range to apply a hex. &nbsp;Here&#39;s the trick, take the smallest valid target for a hex you can find (I recommend turtles) and put them in a small box. Apply a scar to each one of them and give them to your party members to drop in a backpack. (if you care cast stasis or something to put them in a state of suspended animation). Next take a few flying critters you control and scar them to, then send them into range of anything you don&#39;t like. &nbsp;Finally take the split hex feat (you were going to do it anyway). &nbsp;Now any target within 30 feet of ANY target you have scarred can be affected by any non-touch range hex you have while keeping your witch safely up to a mile away from them. &nbsp;Add to that if you want to find/kill/hex the BBEG in a dungeon simply scar and release one of his minions. You can devastate him from the safety of the front door of their dungeon/castle/crypt/etc. &nbsp;</span><span class="c30">mdt </span><span class="c2">further added that the scar hex is also a great hex if you are going to build your witch as a buffer/healer as well, since you can put scars on your allies and pump them full of witchy goodness at range.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.uaptsi9t25o1"><span class="c13 c15">Slumber ****</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Causes a creature within 30 feet to fall asleep for 1 round per witch level if they fail their Will save. &nbsp;Simply devastating as only damage or another creature spending a standard action can wake them.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.svnl5c6zyfgr"><span class="c13 c8">Swamp Hag **</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Allows you to walk over mud and quicksand as if it were &nbsp;normal ground and leaving no trail. &nbsp;Potentially strong for a character who will only be in a swamp environment. </span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.hdscazd7t50m"><span class="c13 c8">Tongues **</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">This is ok giving you comprehend languages and then tongues at 5th level for minutes per day. &nbsp;There are probably better choices given that you get lots of bonus languages for your high Intelligence anyway.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.80o7nb3ncvt0"><span class="c5">Ward ***</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">This is a pretty good hex which gives somebody (not the witch) a +2 AC and +2 to saves which increases by +1 at 8th and 16th lvl until they get hit or fail a save. &nbsp;Quite nice.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.g60npwca6xlz"><span class="c5">Water Lung ***</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&nbsp;Breathe underwater for a minute or sleep underwater. &nbsp;A solid utility, but still a choice </span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.qzvnv6ar8q4q"><span class="c5">Agony (Major) ***</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">60 foot range but you can do better than just nauseate a target at this level.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.3j4oaw4butps"><span class="c13 c8">Beast Eye (Major) &nbsp;**</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">If you have some reliable method of controlling regular animals, this becomes much more useful (Green with animal control, Yellow without).</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.j0jjf1bymk3v"><span class="c13 c15">Cook People (Major) ****</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Evil beyond all doubt but the product is awesome. 1 </span><span class="c11">HOUR</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;buff on any or all stats, freedom from poison and a SMALL sized </span><span>Homunculus</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;servant ?

Problem is you can&#39;t tell which creatures are affected and which aren&#39;t which means you are inclined to believe anything said in the spells range. This means creatures who save and identify the spell can intentionally mislead you. Only the witch&#39;s hexes save this from being red.</span></p><p class="c7 c12"><span class="c2"></span></p><h3 class="c18" id="h.5ascyzgd8rkf-22"><span class="c20">3rd-Level Witch Spells</span></h3><h4 class="c0" id="h.4xe2yaaqdct"><span class="c10">Anthropomorphic Animal * </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">I do not see anything particularly useful seems like more of a downgrade to me.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.9skmm8wqfy3o"><span class="c10">Arcane Sight * </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">A really buffed up cantrip (dispel magic).

Sound useful?</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.nj8u3tdtw623"><span class="c8">Lighting bolt **</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Standard blast. Too bad its area of effect is a really long line and not a radius, but its your best 3rd level blast.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.mon73rbsfrfw"><span class="c8">Loathsome Veil ** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Another HD limit spell fantastic.

Slightly better than ash storm with the same range duration and area of effect.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.cd1yswoszvbj"><span class="c10">Speak With Dead * </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Ask a newly made (or preserved) corpse a few questions. It gets a save to resist and I am not sure if you can cast debuffs or use debuffing hexes on a corpse before you cast the spell.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.sq57pqbk2rj4"><span class="c14">Spit Venom *** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Blind a target for a round with a successful ranged touch attack (no save) and poison him using your spells DC as the poison&#39;s DC (pernicious Poison anyone?).</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.6z3reuh864cm"><span class="c15">Stinking Cloud **** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Fog cloud with a nauseating affect that persists for a few rounds even after the target leaves. Note an unofficial FAQ states this as a poison effect.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.2qf0o3dvpt2g"><span class="c8">Strangling Hair ** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Single Target (though you can switch) battlefield control.Uses your level as BAB and INT mod which is good. Concentration in order to maintain the spell though which hurts the rating.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.48l0egqsqcx"><span class="c8">Suggestion ** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">The will heavy witch spell list and spells that have similar effects make this unimpressive. Note it works on non humanoids though only a single target. Innovation makes this better.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.zb4w1m6o3qkt"><span class="c15">Summon Monster III **** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Awesome summon spell with a huge variety of options. Very versatile spell.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.9efzsc2egxz1"><span class="c8">Tongues ** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">A good scroll and you know what I am going to say about redundancy right? (literally the same name)</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.u6tfih604cww-34"><span class="c10">T</span><span class="c6">wilight </span><span class="c10">K</span><span class="c6">nife *</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">You create a knife that dances around in the air to attack the same creature you attack each round using your crappy BAB. &nbsp;Pathetic.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.87tp33rnbru"><span class="c14">Unadulterated Loathing *** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">The opposite of reckless infatuation, but this works quite nicely as a combat spell.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.7fnq8ttam1f"><span class="c10">Unravel Destiny *</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Another Hero point spell woo. If hero points are a big deal in your campaign then this is ok.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.r6gz89l1ohzm"><span class="c14">Vampiric Touch *** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Creativity with touch attacks makes this spell good. Not a lot of damage, but its negative energy type so immunities are less of a problem. No save either.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.wm54atwx3edh"><span class="c14">Vermin Shape I *** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Self buff that gives Nat armor (stacks with mage armor), ability score bonus and a bonus on saves vs mind affecting abilities. Not a huge duration, but with some planning can be a before combat buff. Very nice utility abilities as well.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.m3qj7laq29zw"><span class="c8">Vision of Hell ** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">An ok spell best used on groups of enemies. Affects your allies which keeps it from being green.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.sr3ker6td74s"><span class="c8">Water Walk ** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Personally I&#39;d stick with fly, but this has some nice utility.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.9ncb041puj2b"><span class="c10">Witness * </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Share senses with another target. Share memory is a better option than this.</span></p><p class="c7 c12"><span class="c2"></span></p><h3 class="c18" id="h.5ascyzgd8rkf-35"><span class="c20">4th-Level Witch Spells</span></h3><h4 class="c0" id="h.kownfldfmte0"><span class="c10">Age Resistance, Lesser * </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">It is not worth its level so do not take this spell.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.qda7deljivs9"><span class="c14">Arcane Eye *** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">If your party is lacking a scout this its a good idea to pick this up and even if you do have a scout this is will save him some danger. Like Clairvoyance except it can be moved around. Sounds will not transmit through the eye however.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.4462fyc864wf"><span class="c15">Black Tentacles **** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">One of my favorite battlefield control spells. No save, no SR, good range, nice radius. Makes a grapple check each round and even deals damage too. Even if the roll is too low to grapple, its still difficult terrain. What&rsquo;s not to love?</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.omu4p76lwk8a"><span class="c10">Cape of Wasps * </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Has some defensive capabilities and utility uses. Make the enemies hesitant to engage you in melee or shoot you with a ranged weapon, also protects against sneak attacks. Slightly redundant with vomit swarm.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.tb6i2k3c5ffa"><span class="c14">Charm Monster *** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Removes the humanoid restriction from charm person at the cost of 3 spell levels. Without debuffing hexes on a target this rating drops to orange.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.ey8vk8jozpki"><span class="c15">Confusion **** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">What&rsquo;s better than a spell that stops groups enemies from taking any actions? One that makes groups of enemies attack each other. Once again only particularly useful against groups, but really wrecks them.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.qa494cm8wtpz-36"><span class="c13 c8">cure serious wounds **</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">This is a nice spell but clerics can cast this as a 3rd level spell.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.88bfaypk1qox"><span class="c14">Curse of Magic Negation *** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">The key here is that the spell resistance cannot be voluntarily lowered. The enemy now has to make checks for any magic item/spell affecting it. Not to mention the checks to cast spells as well.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.mdtbby6xknrm"><span class="c15">Crushing Despair **** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">An AoE debuff that is a decent way to soften up a group of enemies before casting a spell like confusion or stinking cloud. -2&#39;s to everything including damage.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.t648xmrjng61"><span class="c10">Daze, Mass * </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">As far as i can tell the HD limit which is super low (4) is still intact so that pretty much makes this useless for all fights at and beyond the point at which you get this spell.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.dht6sra2z62w"><span class="c14">Death Ward *** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">I care much less about touch when its used on allies and the benefits for this are quite nice. Not a huge duration, but with some proper planning, scouting, or divination this can be a cast before running through the door kind of spell.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.8kh6w2f851ex"><span class="c10">Detect Scrying * </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">NOT prevent scrying, block scrying or stop scrying. Nope, just lets you know that someone is watching your each and every move so that you can flash gang signs and obscenities.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.xbfxa5rj50d5"><span class="c15">Dimension Door **** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">It gets 4 stars for being verbal only. Short range teleport that allows you to take allies with you. Escape grapples, Nasty AoE&#39;s or just escape.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.l87yyd88dy5z"><span class="c10">Discern Lies * </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">The DM gets a lot of wiggle room with this one and it was bad before that. Skip it.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.uvhgvp5qn10n"><span class="c14">Divination *** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Guess what school it belongs too? But seriously, its a pumped of version of augury which was already pretty good. Also, you know if this spell fails or not (unlike augury).</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.uzzpjn8s700i"><span class="c14">Enervation *** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Ranged touch attack spell that adds 1d4 negative levels (which stack). No save. Soften up the an enemy and make your DM do a whole bunch of calculations.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.47nb4kysb5p1"><span class="c8">False Life, Greater ** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">It doesn&#39;t stack with false life so just stick with it as the level increase isn&#39;t worth it in my mind.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.esnejuvt85gr"><span class="c10">Familiar Melding * </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Nothing too useful is jumping out at me and I am not a fan of detaching my soul from my body anyway.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.akjl3ywj1mmd"><span class="c14">Fear *** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Ah yes a fear spell without an HD limit and it has a partial effect on a successful save as will (minor, but still useful).</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.sznfy4nkx801"><span class="c15">Fleshworm Infestation **** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">I am interested to see how the augment summoning feat affects this spell (if at all). Perhaps the only touch spell I will ever rate blue, but it makes attempting that touch attack worth it. Multiple effects ( low damage, ability damage, and staggered). The enemy must save every round and even then it still gets a partial effect.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.93sxqtukyaa8"><span class="c8">Geas, Lesser ** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">HD limit and charm monster is more universally useful, but in a given situation this isn&#39;t bad.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.w0lick3nr4om"><span class="c8">Ice Storm ** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">An ok spell with unimpressive damage, hindered movement and a minus to perception checks. Not bad, but not great either.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.jzvli6w7vmqn"><span class="c10">Inflict Serious Wounds * </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">I hate the inflict spells and they just get worse with level. This is no exception.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.mbf7xtd8tdz6"><span class="c8">Locate Creature ** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Circumstantial, but really useful when you need it.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.ibryfq9ngxga"><span class="c10">Minor Creation * </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">A bad spell and likely evil if you sell the stuff you created. &nbsp;</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.u6tfih604cww-37"><span class="c8">M</span><span class="c13 c8">oonstruck **</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">You cause the enemy to become dazed, then raged and confused if they fail a will save. &nbsp;They drop their weapons and attack randomly. &nbsp;</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.qddg2uc0xmon"><span class="c8">Neutralize Poison ** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">You know the use for this right? Circumstantial, a lifesaver when you need it</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.eazau119tsu0"><span class="c14">Phantasmal Killer *** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Save or die would be blue, but the mere possibility that it can be turned on you is terrible.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.6dxsji7qv02s"><span class="c10">Poison * </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">One save ends the affliction, plus a touch attack to hit and the relatively low damage for the level make this not worth it.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.y7563q1hk04c"><span class="c8">Ride the wave ** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">In an aquatic campaign this is blue. Breath water or air and gain a swim speed and the ability to take 10s.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.43niw0l8fxf3"><span class="c8">Scrying ** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Good way to keep tabs on a target and you can use special vision types.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.8gj8sgqpmm6j"><span class="c8">Secure Shelter ** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Good way to set up a home base in a dungeon or the wild if you HAVE to rest.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.2lu5yd4rgang"><span class="c10">Shadow Step *</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Dimension door is much better and more versatile.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.oun7efcw9jhu"><span class="c8">Sleepwalk ** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">A good way to get creative with the slumber hex. Make enemies walk to their own demise.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.fu7cms1bjefy"><span class="c14">Solid Fog *** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Sleet storm is going to cover most of what this does, but the creative will still find a use for it (use to negate falling damage, severely hinder rangers and rouges, etc.)</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.2h7ivk8nfyu4"><span class="c15">Summon Monster IV **** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Amazing versatility in combat and out. A summon spell worth taking.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Note: Ratings for the *Symbol* spells is based on making the spell permanent and being innovative with the trigger and placement. Otherwise, all of these are red.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.u6tfih604cww-38"><span class="c14">S</span><span class="c5">pite ***</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">A handy spell to have as an extra line of defence against those who would dare lay hands on you. &nbsp;They will trigger a 4th level of lower spell against them that you have cast with the spite spell.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.mazrg7w3z8v0"><span class="c8">Symbol of Healing ** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Too redundant with healing hexes to rate this any higher. The costly material component really kills this.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.vm03ibws8k18"><span class="c8">Symbol of Revelation ** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">I would make this a tattoo spend the cash to make it permanent and make the trigger looking at it if I was going to do this at all. Going halfway with this one is a waste of time.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.ic5c45r703ul"><span class="c8">Symbol of Slowing ** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">If making symbols permanent is your thing then by all means take this. As for me I can&#39;t spend that kind of money on a single spell even if it is good forever.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.u6tfih604cww-39"><span class="c15">T</span><span class="c13 c15">hreefold </span><span class="c15">A</span><span class="c13 c15">spect ****</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Make yourself look older or younger. &nbsp;This spell has great roleplaying potential and if you choose to change into an old crone, you get a +4 bonus to Intelligence.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.caipusvy03et"><span class="c10">Touch of Slime * </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">How is this different than poison? same rating, same reasons.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.7o5aoxb3tzi1"><span class="c14">Vermin Shape II *** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">A buffed up version of vermin shape I. Probably worth waiting for this spell than taking the lower level one.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.qlaiglm3k21s"><span class="c8">Volcanic Storm ** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">See ice storm.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.qa494cm8wtpz-40"><span class="c10">W</span><span class="c6">andering </span><span class="c10">S</span><span class="c6">tar </span><span class="c10">M</span><span class="c6">otes *</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Similar to a glitterdust spell in some ways except it only affects one creature at a time and is 2 spell slots dearer.</span></p><p class="c7 c12"><span class="c2"></span></p><h3 class="c18" id="h.5ascyzgd8rkf-41"><span class="c20">5th-Level Witch Spells</span></h3><h4 class="c0" id="h.m2yta1di4duk"><span class="c15">Baleful Polymorph **** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Essentially a save or die in the form of a save or lose. Target makes a save or becomes a harmless animal, then makes another save or loses all magical and supernatural abilities. All of this with the duration of permanent. Perfect finisher for the witch hexes.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.qa494cm8wtpz-42"><span class="c6">banish seeming *</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">With a melee touch attack you can dispel an illusion or return a creature to its natural form. &nbsp;Seems rather an expensive use of a 5th level slot.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.cry4yvlp5pwm"><span class="c8">Blight ** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Hurt a plant very badly. If you are fighting a giant plant this is probably a decent choice, otherwise this is a good way to tick off the party druid.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.36thlw4psad5"><span class="c8">Break Enchantment ** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Pretty useful in the event that you find a cursed item or the party is subjugated to some sort of unwilling enchantment or transmutation (like baleful polymorph).</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.v02vv1dldkma"><span class="c14">Cloudkill ***</span></h4><p class="c7"><span>This is one of the best AoE kill spells out there. Send it in front of you and have it kill or badly injure everything in front of you for 11 minutes. And it&#39;s CON damage so even if they live through it they take 1-2 HP/Level each round they are in it. </span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.mwvrkp3q9wd9"><span class="c10">Contact Other Plane * </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Know what is worse than losing points in your primary stat? This spell. Don&#39;t take it.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.59xbh48utwj1"><span class="c8">Contagion, Greater ** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span>This is a city/army/group killing spell. Drop it on an enemy and they suffer the effects immediately (and can&#39;t cure it without high level magic) and then everyone they come in contact with gets it and they can&#39;t cure it without magic. 1 Diseased rat thrown into a city street is death for that city, maybe that whole kingdom.3 stars (4 in kingmaker type games)</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.u6tfih604cww-43"><span class="c8">C</span><span class="c8 c13">ure </span><span class="c8">C</span><span class="c13 c8">ritical </span><span class="c8">W</span><span class="c13 c8">ounds **</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">This is a nice spell but clerics can cast this as a 4th level spell.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.lry5jnhh0g77"><span class="c14">Curse, Major *** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Gets rid of the touch range making it a better spell for combat. A good way to debuff an enemy in combat (though it gets a save and SR does apply).</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.fxbltmnq4wjt"><span class="c8">Curse of Disgust ** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span>The above spell is superior is a number of ways.</span><span>&nbsp;This spell is a permanent -2 to all die rolls with no save whenever you decide to invoke it on your target</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.lpgrr5ofkuox"><span class="c14">Dominate Person ***</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">A buffed up charm person. Making commands that oppose a targets nature give the subject an extra save. (rating may drop depending on how your DM views this). A pretty good spell to have your very own puppet.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.nmc768f9cghu"><span class="c15">Feeblemind **** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Wreck casters of all kinds (arcane especially). Ruins all spellcasting ability and gives a -4 to the saves of those who cast arcane spells.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.ss5l3ydd8ler"><span class="c8">Hold Monster ** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">A good spell, but a pretty high level for the effect. It is essentially a SoD on one enemy, but it affects will so more of the same.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.a8vy98bopvpa"><span class="c10">Inflict Critical Wounds * </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Want to do something not useless with a touch attack? Scroll up to fleshworm infestation</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.8rxm3fx92301"><span class="c15">Magic Jar **** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Awesome spell. Clear entire rooms with no danger to your allies or yourself. As far as I can tell you still have access to all your hexes too making this spell that much better. Is there a rating better than blue?</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.4a7cqqsnpxsk"><span class="c14">Major Creation *** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span>better duration than Minor Creation and no limit to what you can create (bridges, wallas statues, etc)</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.stncadz8itc0"><span class="c10">Mark of Justice *</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Bestow curse with 100x the casting time, you have to write on the target and it has to be willing or restrained. No saving throw, but for a 5th level spell your kidding right? This is crap.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.y2j1cfm8js7l"><span class="c14">Mind Fog *** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Ask your DM if you know who is affected and who isn&#39;t, if so this is blue. Soften up a group of enemies at range on their will saves and wisdom checks severely. For your will heavy list, this is awesome.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.lwfjwlnauyqx"><span class="c14">Overland Flight ***</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Afraid of the monster charging you while you are within 30 feet? No problem if you are in the air (typically) and get a substantial bonus on fly checks. Redundant with the fly hex, but a much longer duration and you may want that hex for something else.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.qa494cm8wtpz-44"><span class="c10">P</span><span class="c6">ain </span><span class="c10">S</span><span class="c6">trike</span><span class="c10">, M</span><span class="c6">ass *</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Non lethal damage limiting number of targets by your level. &nbsp;Weak compared to other blaster spells.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.8oyrxqdpoka"><span class="c10">Plague Carrier * </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">This could have been such a cool spell for an animal companion or monk, but the onset time (1d3 days) killed it.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.8rqbevdjp4sj"><span class="c14">Possess Object *** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span>Good spell. &nbsp;You effectively take control of a construct (and all the perks there) PLUS you get to use construct points from the Animate Object spell to manipulate the body you are in. Flying shark statues with lasers attached to their heads here I come. &nbsp;</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.2ggw0c2y0jsn"><span class="c14">Prying Eyes *** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span>It&#39;s the equivalent of sending 15 copies of yourself to scout out every nook and cranny within 1 mile of you. An amazing spy/trap detector/treasure hunter spell. Best on a scroll but awesome for learning everything about the castle/tower/fort/cave/etc. you just decided to assault.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.gn5jyztb7ood"><span class="c14">Reincarnate *** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Unlike raise dead this works if the creature died from old age or if they were missing limbs, eyes etc. It also works on targets afflicted with magical or incurable diseases.</span></p><p class="c7"><span>Most importantly it works on UNDEAD and is the cheapest way to return someone from undeath. All things that Raise dead can&#39;t do and it&#39;s a lot cheaper as well. </span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.u6tfih604cww-45"><span class="c10">R</span><span class="c6">est </span><span class="c10">E</span><span class="c6">ternal *</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">You curse a dead creature that bars its spirit from returning. &nbsp;Yawn.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.c2pp9hcvfg5w"><span class="c8">Secret Chest ** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Has some material component cost, but is a good way to store very important items and heavy war spoils.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.e3s1xjbgqzpn"><span class="c14">Smug Narcissism *** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span>The target spends all his effort on defense instead of offense. Shuts down blasters completely and any heavy hitter the opponents have stops attacking everyone. Massive debuff if you target it correctly. </span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.u6tfih604cww-46"><span class="c14">Suffocation ***</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">A reasonable spell that can disable a creature after 1 round if it fails a fortitude test and can potentially kill it in 3 rounds if it continues to fail saves.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.atkhhp8izl07"><span class="c14">Summon Monster V *** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">A little less versatility, but still a good spell overall.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.bw4u4jhtwzsg"><span class="c15">Symbol of Pain **** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span>Usually symbol spells can be ok for the creative. &nbsp;</span><span>This is better than evil eye (especially if you scribe it on a book to trigger at will) since it&#39;s an AoE. &nbsp;Evil eye effect that lasts an hour that hits attacks &amp; skill checks (acrobatics for tumbling rogues, Intimidate for dazzling display, perception for detecting traps/invisibility, etc). </span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.reyh1x8869wf"><span class="c8">Symbol of Scrying ** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span>Don&#39;t know where the thieves guild is or want to find something that was stolen. Put this on it and let it get stolen. You always know where your belongings are and makes a heck of a scry and fry focus. </span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.4bfafuops47f"><span class="c14">Telepathic Bond *** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Awesome utility spell that has a decent duration and allows communication over any distance.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.vpqtltxht7kg"><span class="c14">Teleport *** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Great utility spell with the mishaps being super circumstantial and not all that bad. Great way to get around the world.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.kma2irwcqnnj"><span class="c8">Waves of Fatigue ** </span></h4><p class="c7"><span>No saving throw so that is good, but fatigue is not all that impressive. Would be pretty good if you could stack with regular fatigue, but ray of exhaustion after the fact will still do nicely.</span></p><p class="c7 c12"><span class="c2"></span></p><h3 class="c18" id="h.5ascyzgd8rkf-47"><span class="c20">6th-Level Witch Spells</span></h3><h4 class="c0" id="h.qa494cm8wtpz-48"><span class="c10">C</span><span class="c6">loak of </span><span class="c10">D</span><span class="c6">reams *</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">With a melee touch attack you can dispel an illusion or return a creature to its natural form. &nbsp;Seems rather an expensive use of a 5th level slot.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.u6tfih604cww-49"><span class="c8">C</span><span class="c13 c8">ure </span><span class="c8">L</span><span class="c13 c8">ight </span><span class="c8">W</span><span class="c13 c8">ounds</span><span class="c8">, M</span><span class="c13 c8">ass **</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">This is a nice spell but you can already do this with your healing hex.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.qa494cm8wtpz-50"><span class="c10">F</span><span class="c6">ester</span><span class="c10">, M</span><span class="c6">ass *</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Like the 2nd level spell fester, but now you can be even lamer by wasting a 6th level spell and doing this to many.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.u6tfih604cww-51"><span class="c10">I</span><span class="c6">nflict </span><span class="c10">L</span><span class="c6">ight </span><span class="c10">W</span><span class="c6">ounds, </span><span class="c10">M</span><span class="c6">ass *</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">There are better ways to do mass damage.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.u6tfih604cww-52"><span class="c14">R</span><span class="c5">aise </span><span class="c14">D</span><span class="c5">ead ***</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Bringing your allies back to life is never a bad thing.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.u6tfih604cww-53"><span class="c14">S</span><span class="c5">warm </span><span class="c14">S</span><span class="c5">kin ***</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">This gets 3 stars for its coolness factor. &nbsp;Turn yourself into a swarm of vermin just like Count Dracula.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.u6tfih604cww-54"><span class="c8">U</span><span class="c13 c8">nwilling </span><span class="c8">S</span><span class="c13 c8">hield ***</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Make the enemy suffer half of your injuries for 1 round per level. &nbsp;Not bad but they get a will save and there is spell </span><span>resistance</span><span class="c2">.</span></p><p class="c7 c12"><span class="c2"></span></p><h3 class="c18" id="h.5ascyzgd8rkf-55"><span class="c20">7th-Level Witch Spells</span></h3><h4 class="c0" id="h.u6tfih604cww-56"><span class="c8">C</span><span class="c13 c8">ure </span><span class="c8">M</span><span class="c13 c8">oderate </span><span class="c8">W</span><span class="c13 c8">ounds, </span><span class="c8">M</span><span class="c13 c8">ass**</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">At close range, you can heal a number of targets up to your level with a CMW which will cover everyone in the party. &nbsp;This is a nice spell but you can already do this with your healing hex and a cleric in the party can do this more effectively by channeling positive energy.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.qa494cm8wtpz-57"><span class="c10">H</span><span class="c6">arm *</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">It charges a subject with negative energy that deals 10 points of damage per caster level up to 150 hit points of damage. &nbsp;A successful will save will only do half damage. &nbsp;Problem with this spell is it cannot reduce the target below 1 hit point making this spell very inefficient for a 7th level spell that only targets one creature.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.u6tfih604cww-58"><span class="c14">H</span><span class="c5">eal ***</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">This heals a subject with positive energy for 10 points of healing per caster level up to 150 hit points of damage. &nbsp;Not only that, it removes nearly any adverse condition affecting the target such as staggered, stunned, fatigued, blinded, poisoned to name just a few.</span></p><h4 class="c0" id="h.u6tfih604cww-59"><span class="c10">I</span><span class="c6">nflict </span><span class="c10">M</span><span class="c6">oderate </span><span class="c10">W</span><span class="c6">ounds (mass) *</span></h4><p class="c7"><span class="c2">There are far better ways to inflict mass damage than waste a 7th level spell slot with this.</span></p><p class="c7 c12"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7 c12"><span class="c2"></span></p><h1 class="c29 c34" id="h.u3b4jlp3la6p"><span class="c26">Change Log</span></h1><p class="c7 c32"><span>2018-03-22 Brett Leatherman - Fixed inconsistent title case of spell names, changed &ldquo;(mass)&rdquo;
