So it&rsquo;s no surprise that organized play has its own rules about how these non humanoid pathfinders function in the party.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">I recommend that you read this whole document through at least once -- your animal friends will thank you for it! &nbsp;If you have questions or want to discuss this guide, check out the </span><span class="c5 c7"><a class="c9" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://paizo.com/threads/rzs2ql8b?Druids-Log-Animal-companions&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117343791000&amp;usg=AOvVaw33Wa8iR7litJ65pk9CIQn-">Druid&rsquo;s Log: Animal Companions</a></span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c3">thread on the Paizo Forums. &nbsp;Consider the above link your Druid Local 704 Union Card!</span></p><p class="c20 c24"><span class="c18 c32"></span></p><h1 class="c15" id="h.tyhkxo5zc2r9"><span>Table of Contents</span></h1><p class="c12"><span class="c5"><a class="c9" href="#h.wsgyb1xdkno7">Part I: Resources</a></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5"><a class="c9" href="#h.g0gsh7hds8ej">A few Random Points and less frequently asked questions</a></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c5"><a class="c9" href="#h.6alnud1ookj9">Part II: Selecting the companion that&#39;s right for you.</a></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c5"><a class="c9" href="#h.5fu4ktqyiqi0">Part III: We can build it stronger... faster....</a></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c5"><a class="c9" href="#h.85sqcx97luyh">Part IV: Turning tricks.</a></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5"><a class="c9" href="#h.2rplh0oabd8e">How to train your &ldquo;not a dragon&rdquo;</a></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5"><a class="c9" href="#h.1s74g3w06h0t">Most tricks are pretty self explanatory but a few bear mention</a></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c5"><a class="c9" href="#h.j91srd91d8vu">Part V: Handle Animal and You.</a></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c5"><a class="c9" href="#h.53ejh6p4exyw">Part VI: Hocks, withers, fetlocks, toes -- Magic Items &amp; Animals</a></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5"><a class="c9" href="#h.2rr12ifn4d9f">Avian</a></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5"><a class="c9" href="#h.hfevmqbfmdfv">Biped: Claws / Paws</a></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5"><a class="c9" href="#h.texv7zlacqt1">Biped: Hands</a></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5"><a class="c9" href="#h.zdvlgmwir20e">Piscine: Fishy</a></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5"><a class="c9" href="#h.w8hcposmj51e">Quadruped: Claws &amp; Paws</a></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5"><a class="c9" href="#h.e078oynbrpjf">Quadruped / Hexapod: Feet</a></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5"><a class="c9" href="#h.2j4khejgk9ax">Quadruped: Hooves</a></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5"><a class="c9" href="#h.hieeeordlln1">Quadruped: Squat Body</a></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5"><a class="c9" href="#h.4i40odeftyfq">Saurian</a></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5"><a class="c9" href="#h.4sszfu2gmicx">Serpentine</a></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5"><a class="c9" href="#h.uqccjy6sf3c0">Verminous</a></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c5"><a class="c9" href="#h.shmweqododyc">Part VII: Feral Fashion</a></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c5"><a class="c9" href="#h.de60sfmq6qhn">Part VIII: Accessorizing</a></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c5"><a class="c9" href="#h.o34r1o947oh4">Part IX: Catch and Release</a></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c5"><a class="c9" href="#h.tfsblwn7ugxe">Part X: Feats &amp; Racials</a></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c5"><a class="c9" href="#h.yrev6j9nqwde">Part XI: Additional Resources and Other Guides</a></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c5"><a class="c9" href="#h.s7e4kkmermju">Part X: Animal Companion Etiquette</a></span></p><p class="c20 c24"><span class="c18 c32"></span></p><p class="c20 c24"><span class="c18 c32"></span></p><h1 class="c21" id="h.wsgyb1xdkno7"><span>Part I: </span><span class="c4 c6">Resources</span></h1><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c23"><a class="c9" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://paizo.com/prd/classes/druid.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117343798000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3gb-HYbMbzKb6LXs8arjIt">The druid</a></span><span class="c1"><a class="c9" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://paizo.com/prd/classes/druid.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117343798000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3gb-HYbMbzKb6LXs8arjIt">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="c4 c3">for basic information about your companion.

An animal companion can be an entire course unto itself but even if it&rsquo;s just icing on the cake then you still have cake. Bears are, objectively, pretty bad compared to other options but they&#39;re still great for a class feature. PFS is not so deadly that you NEED to take the pouncing kitty/velociraptor of mangley death (unless you want to.)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">With that said, here are a few ups and downs of common choices.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c18 c32"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c13">Kitty!</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;Awwww they&#39;re so cute. Don&#39;t you just want to belly rub them? Well, watch your arms. On pure math the kitty probably does the most damage. Pounce + rake and large size means that these adorable bundles of fluff pack a whallop. The grab ability is amazing against spellcasters, who have very limited options once they&#39;re grabbed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">I cannot stress enough how good pounce is. Melee fighters usually suffer a great deal from their need to move up and damage, but lose a lot of ability to damage from doing so, especially if they dual wield. Pounce gives you all the mobility of an animals high movement AND the ability to take advantage of the full attack.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c13">Horses:</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;The good news is that you can ride them and they&#39;re accepted everywhere. The bad news is that they often have trouble doing things like getting up stairs, climbing down holes, and getting their lil tushies into the teleportation tapestry we keep in the basement. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">The society tends to either send us into a dungeon where no one minds the giant cat, or into a fancy party where neither the giant cat or the horse are allowed without a lot of middleground, negating one of the horses advantages.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c13">Wolfy:</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;A good mount for a companion. Having one big bite usually does less damage than having multiple attacks, but your fighters and rogues will thank you when the free trip attack lands the bad guys on the ground. One advantage to one attack is the 1.5 x strength damage for going through Damage Resistance. Even more things hanging out at our dig sites have damage resistance than fly, and animal companions can&#39;t carry a golf bag full of different weapons to use. One thing to remember is that a bite is Piercing, Bludgeoning, and slashing, so whether you&#39;re chomping on a skeleton or a zombie you&#39;re good to go.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c13">Dire bat:</span><span class="c3 c4">&nbsp;Awww.. its an adorable giant fox with wings. While a horse is great for riding down foes on the ground, it seems every other dig site I&#39;m at has either flying wizards, harpies, demons, or flying wizard harpy demons. If you&#39;re a little more inclined to beat on things than most druids and have learned how to use a lance at some point you can do a lot of damage on the back of one of these.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">Now to get onto Sith&#39;s point...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c13">Velociraptor/deinonychus.</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;Whether your cute lil hatchling comes with scales or feathers, they function much like the cat. The bad news is they don&#39;t hit quite as hard or grab. The upside is that they have pounce when medium sized, which is handy because the society tends to send us into underground ruins that aren&#39;t big on feng shui. The charge rules hit large creatures acting in a group hard. They don&#39;t charge as hard but they can charge more often.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c13">Stegosaurus/Ankylosaurus</span><span class="c4 c3">. While I find the term &quot;meat shield&quot; to be a warning sign that someone isn&#39;t taking their responsibilities as a caretaker seriously these two companions are excellent choices for defending your party. The ankylosaurus has a lot of natural armor, and the stegosaurus&#39;s are incredibly agile for their size. The society doesn&#39;t always remember to send along enough body guards, and the ones that they do send tend to just charge off into the middle of things with a big honking sword and leave the casters alone and vulnerable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5"><a class="c9" href="#h.tyhkxo5zc2r9">Return to Table of Contents</a></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><h1 class="c21" id="h.5fu4ktqyiqi0"><span>Part III: </span><span class="c4 c6">We can build it stronger... faster....</span></h1><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Building or leveling your an animal companion can be tricky.

I highly recommend an animal companion have its own character sheet, and a bit of graph paper for scrap wouldn&#39;t hurt.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">Start with the statistics listed for your animal companion to get its base stats. Remember to use the statistics for the animal companion, NOT the bestiary critter. If you&#39;re leveling, or using DM protoplasm to start at a higher level, your animal companion may advance. Adjust the stats accordingly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">One often overlooked option is instead of taking the listed benefit at 4th or 7th level, you can instead choose to increase the companion&#39;s Dexterity and Constitution by 2. This doesn&#39;t make sense for many companions, who get powerful abilities like stun or pounce for taking the standard leveling package. If you want a scout, or you have a dex based companion like a giant weasel it may be viable though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c29">Hit Dice:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c29"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c23"><a class="c9" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://paizo.com/pathfinderSociety/faq%23v5748eaic9os4&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117343814000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3zyXZD6ou1Y00wpILk2VWk">&nbsp;Animal companions have 4.5 Hit points per hit die, round down</a></span><span class="c4 c7">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">Since they do not have hit dice from a PC class they do not get the automatic maximum on the first d8. Its important to recalculate the hit points every level. If you just add 4.5 and round down every time you&#39;re costing yourself a hit point every other level.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">Remember that you add the Constitution bonus and toughness based on the number of hit dice, not your druid level. At first level your critter will have 9+ twice their con bonus. For a companion with a good constitution this can give them more hit points than some first level fighters.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c29">Skills:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">Animal companions can have ranks in any of the following skills: Acrobatics* (Dex), Climb* (Str), Escape Artist (Dex), Fly* (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Perception* (Wis), Stealth* (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim* (Str). All of the skills marked with an (*) are class skills for animal companions. Animal companions with an Intelligence of 3 or higher can put ranks into any skill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">Since you have so few skill points one option is to put 1 rank into a few skills like Acrobatics swim and perception to round out the animal&#39;s abilities and take advantage of the +3 for being a trained skill. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">It&rsquo;s weird to note that intimidate, escape artist, and especially survival don&#39;t get the +3 from being class skills. Acrobatics is especially handy since animals almost always have to move into melee range to attack, which often involves moving through threatened squares and jumping over the inevitable bottomless chasm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c29">Feats: </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">Critters are limited to the listed feats listed and those in the animal archive unless they up their intelligence score, at which point they&#39;re in the slightly murky area of &quot;any feat they can physically use&quot;. &nbsp;For PFS the only known hard limit on that is that they can&#39;t take weapon feats. When selecting your feats make absolutely sure you meet the prerequisites of the feat at the time you take it. Note that your animal had a BAB of 0 when it got its first feat, so it can&#39;t take the ever popular power attack until it has 3 hd.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c29">Natural Armor bonus: </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">Remember that this is additive from three sources: the amount you get from the chart, AND the amount each animal companion species comes with, AND the amount (most) companions get for advancing at 4th or 7th level. The three together can add up quickly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c29">Str/Dex bonus: </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">Your animals strength and dex increase. This is in addition to the &quot;floating&quot; increase it gets every 4 HD.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c29">Bonus Tricks: </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">Tricks will be its own section, but do remember to add tricks as your companion levels up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c29">Link: </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">You get a +4 to handle your animal companion and can do it faster than &quot;normal&quot;. This is incredibly handy at lower levels as it lets you automatically succeed on tricks with even a minimal investment in handle animal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c29">Share spells: </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Note that this has changed from 3.5.

First off with the more literal minded DM&#39;s you need a trick for the animal to do anything. More intelligence = three more tricks to use. With the more freeform DM&#39;s you can usually have more leeway in what actions your animal will take if it is preternaturally smart compared to others of its kind. Secondly strength and dex increase automatically via the chart, strength and con go up when the creature advances, but this is about your only chance to increase its intelligence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">Most importantly it opens an entire new world of feats your companion can take. Remember when planning your companions feat progression that unusual feats can&#39;t be taken sooner than 5th level because you need to up your intelligence score and THEN pick the feat. Even if you acquire your companion latter in its life it still developed organically with the restrictions in place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c29">Multi-Attack: </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">For &quot;one big bite&quot; companions like the wolf or spinosaurus (thanks Sithis) this is amazing, giving you a second attack at your full 1.5X strength bad guy chomping goodness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">One really bizarre result of the changes in primary/secondary attacks from 3.5 is that creatures that already have multiple primary attacks like the cat and velociraptor </span><span class="c1"><a class="c9" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://paizo.com/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5le1h?NPC-Codex-Preview-Animals-Cant-Vote%2329&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117343819000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2cVhsWyOQvbMpnR0xj0JrW">also benefit from this extra attack</a></span><span class="c4 c3">.

Bonus tricks you gain as your companion levels don&#39;t require any training time or Handle Animal checks.

Flank is largely irrelevant because you tell the mount where to go.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">For an independently acting animal, I highly recommend Attack, attack, come, defend, down, seek, and heel. If you have access to the animal archive (which i cannot recommend enough if you have a pet) I would replace come with the flank trick and simply use heel to keep the animal in your general area and defend to watch your immediate person.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><h2 class="c21" id="h.1s74g3w06h0t"><span class="c4 c28">Most tricks are pretty self explanatory but a few bear mention</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Without getting the </span><span class="c7 c10">attack trick twice</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;animals will only attack humanoids, monstrous humanoids, giants, or other animals.. meaning plants undead oozes constructs elementals ie, the things you&#39;re mostly likely to find in your way, can&#39;t be attacked without succeeding at a very hard move action dc 25 check to push them into it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">Fetch</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;can be pivotal in society play, where often you need to retrieve an object from the clutches of the bad guy rather than collect the bad guys liver.

You release the animal companion and </span><span class="c1"><a class="c9" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://paizo.com/pathfinderSociety/faq%23v5748eaic9os5&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117343858000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3yc1HDAluEVFAGp_RVkBvn">you get a new one next session.</a></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c37"><a class="c9" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://paizo.com/pathfinderSociety/faq%23v5748eaic9os5&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117343859000&amp;usg=AOvVaw21EkU16_cskt_nL7d3VuGR"></a></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">Your critter only comes fully trained when you first acquire the ability to get them, so this fuzzy friend will show up only knowing the free bonus tricks you get based on your effective druid level. If you are really short on tricks, defend, heel, and down will give you a somewhat useful bodyguard, even if you won&#39;t be able to send them after specific targets and it might not be willing to bite a zombie for you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">To train them you can, in the nebulous time in between scenarios, make 1 attempt to train the animal per rank in handle animal. You may take 10 on this check, and if that will let you succeed you should do so, since there&#39;s no benefit in getting a higher result. There&#39;s no word on whether this is before or after the scenario, so you&#39;ll have to ask the DM when he wants to allow you to train. Training for a purpose isn&#39;t that much different than training each trick individually. Get the tricks you absolutely need first (attack twice), and then worry about the other ones.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">This is infinitely easier for higher level characters, who can retrain their new friend twice over in one session, and very hard on lower level characters who may have to spend multiple sessions with a half trained half wild beast as they inch their way towards obedience. To avoid this (and having druids local 704 break out the pointy sticks) see the beginning of the thread for armor and items for your non humanoid pathfinder.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">Remember when picking your new feats that just because your animal companion appeared fully formed right next to you doesn&#39;t mean you can take any feat he qualifies for NOW. You weren&#39;t always the center of his life. He grew up organically and has to qualify for the feats when they select them. This is also a good time to decide what kind of armor your friend will be wearing for the rest of his career now that his size has stabilized.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">A bigger concern is, oddly enough, the role playing aspects of such an action. If you release a level 7 grey cat with black spots named Fluffy the Terrible with weapon finesse who likes tuna and long walks on the beach and acquire a level 7 grey cat with black spots named Fluffy the Terrible with toughness and power attack who likes tuna and long walks on the beach... are they the same animal?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">I think ultimately that question is up to the player and how they feel about it.

Some other players and DMs might make a few jokes about the cat &quot;Not being the same anymore&quot; or &quot;Does he look different to you?&quot; but they&#39;ll die down after a few sessions and the Fluffy you have and love will be the same fluffy you&#39;ve always had and loved.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5"><a class="c9" href="#h.tyhkxo5zc2r9">Return to Table of Contents</a></span></p><p class="c20 c24"><span class="c18 c32"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c20 c24"><span class="c18 c32"></span></p><p class="c20 c24"><span class="c18 c32"></span></p><h1 class="c15" id="h.tfsblwn7ugxe"><span class="c4 c6">Part X: Feats &amp; Racials</span></h1><p class="c20 c24"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c20"><span class="c4 c3">This is additional content provided by Hmm &amp; Damanta, Liaisons to the non-druid members of Local 704.</span></p><p class="c20 c24"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><ul class="c35 lst-kix_5shk0c5ruies-0 start"><li class="c8 c36 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c3"><a class="c9" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/boon-companion&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117343861000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0e7uMG4IBwBf40dkBFAt8U">Boon Companion</a></span><span class="c3">&nbsp;-- Many of the </span><span class="c5 c3"><a class="c9" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Lz56PE_7exIxy1Jfp0bD_7jA7bNlTEmWnSNFCGp7uuw/pubhtml?gid%3D0%26single%3Dtrue&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117343862000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2chFXyvADgRkHrsYYN4gJK">classes that offer animal companions and mounts</a></span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;offer them at a lower level than that available to druids. &nbsp;This feat from Animal Archive will bring your companion to your effective class level. &nbsp;Show your love to your best friend and get this feat.</span></li><li class="c8 c36 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c3"><a class="c9" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human%23TOC-Alternate-Racial-Traits&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117343862000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1YzAmLWPnPY_I3zQwrTJs8">Eye for Talent</a></span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;-- A human only alternate racial trait. &nbsp;At the cost of your bonus feat (ouch!) you can get a +2 to any attribute on your animal companion and a +2 to Sense Motive for yourself. &nbsp;Put it into your animal&rsquo;s intelligence and open up a world of tricks and feats for your animal. &nbsp;Requires the Advanced Player Guide.</span></li><li class="c8 c36 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c3"><a class="c9" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/racial-feats/beast-rider-orc-half-orc&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117343863000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3sv86ImW_BC25N9ZzVS8FE">Beast Rider</a></span><span class="c3">&nbsp;-- Half-Orc (or Orc, if you have a boon) only. &nbsp;Great for classes with limited animal choices, and provides part of the leveling you might get from Boon Companion. &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c3">Select one of the following creature types: elephant, pteranodon, rhinoceros, stegosaurus, or triceratops.
