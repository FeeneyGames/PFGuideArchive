And probably deep down we find turning a battlefield into sheets of molten glass is fun. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">One of the precepts of battlefield control is enabling your allies to act while hindering your foes. &nbsp;There are many ways to do this. You can slow, blind, paralyze, stun, daze, entangle etc. your foes but there&rsquo;s an inherent simplicity of elegance when you inflict status effect: DEAD. Or vaporized; vaporized is good too. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">We will skip the Sorcerer vs. Wizard, and not consider the blasting cleric or oracle. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s already guides or really long debate threads for them. &nbsp;We&rsquo;re going to keep it simple and stick with Sorcerer. In addition as PFS effectively stops at 12th for most characters the bulk of our advice will focus for the low to mid-level game. </span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Also when using any traits, races, feats, spells, archetypes, etc...for PFS it is required that you have a copy of the sourcebook in question. Best to buy the PDFs if you are trying to save money (or maybe ebay old sets from folks who decided to stop playing or get rid of them.)</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Now for the guide to this guide.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">1.Introduction-you just read this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">2.Basics and terminology. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">3.Your stats.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">4.Races.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">5.Traits.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">6.Feats.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">7.Bloodlines</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">8.Archetypes</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">9.Skills</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">10.Spells.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">11.Sample Builds.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">2.Basics and terminology</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">In Pathfinder there are a plethora of choices for races, feats, spells, and so on. We&rsquo;re going to rate them as follows:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c0 c5">Blue this selection is really good and normally among the best of choices. You generally want this. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Green this option is decent, but there are better. &nbsp;Situationally and depending on your other choices, could be bumped to </span><span class="c8 c0 c5">Blue. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c0 c6">Red. &nbsp;We ought to skip this one. &nbsp;Maybe there&rsquo;s some obscure reason or build that makes this shine...but that&rsquo;s too much work and we&rsquo;ll spend too much time on building and not face-melting.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Core, PFS, or Paizo? Depending on the campaign particulars will determine the availability of your options. We will focus primarily on PFS legal options. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">AoE. Stands for Area of effect. &nbsp;Why nuke one target when you can plaster a wide area? Oh, your buddies are in the mess. &nbsp;Well there are ways around that. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">SR. Short for Spell Resistance. Some critters are unwilling to be melted and you have to make a check to get through their magical defense. </span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">3.Your stats</span></p><p class="c1"><span>As a sorcerer, your primary casting stat is </span><span class="c0 c5">Charisma, or Cha. </span><span>You want this as high as possible. Of secondary importance is</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;Dexterity, Constitution, and Intelligence</span><span class="c3">. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2 c0">Dexterity helps you go first, your reflex save, your ranged attack modifier and your AC. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2 c0">Constitution helps your survive a hit without folding (hit points), your Fortitude save (poison, disease, energy drain and other health-related nasties).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2 c0">Intelligence is needed for one reason and one reason only: the feat Spell Specialization. Get this to 13 and then leave it alone. </span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0 c6 c8"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c6">Wisdom</span><span>&nbsp;governs your all-important Will Save. It&rsquo;s your best save, but no reason to grind it down into the basement. And it does influence </span><span class="c0 c5">Perception</span><span class="c3">, the most important skill in the game.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c6">Strength </span><span class="c3">is pretty much a dump stat...but being one-shot by a shadow (1d6 strength damage, 0 = dead) or if your GM is going to play the encumbrance game on you you&rsquo;ll have to leave it at a reasonable value. If you&rsquo;re okay with that, dump it into the basement. </span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Recommended stat arrays before racial modifiers. This a more balanced array. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">15 point buy. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Str 7(-4) Dex 14(5) Con 14(5) Int 13(3) Wis 9(-1) Cha 15(7)</span></p><p class="c1"><span>20 point buy. (What we use for PFS)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Str 7(-4) Dex 14(5) Con 14(5) Int 13(3) Wis 11(1) Cha 16(10)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">25 point buy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Str 8(-2) Dex 14(5) Con 14(5) Int 13(3) Wis 11(1) Cha 17(13)</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Alternatively if you want to run a riskier character and focus more on Charisma.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">15 point buy. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Str 7(-4) Dex 13(3) Con 12(2) Int 13(3) Wis 8(-2) Cha 17(13)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">20 point buy. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Str 7(-4) Dex 13(3) Con 12(2) Int 13(3) Wis 9(-1) Cha 18(17)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">25 point buy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Str 8(-2) Dex 14(5) Con 12(2) Int 13(3) Wis 11(1) Cha 18(17)</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">4.Races</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Ideally you want a race that boosts your primary stat, Charisma. A secondary boost to Dexterity, Constitution, or even Int is welcome. &nbsp;Also sorcerers need a lot of feats to get going. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Naturally the best choice is:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c5">Human. </span><span class="c3">Put your racial modifier to Charisma. Bonus feat for a feat-starved class. Human racial favored class bonus allows your to expand your spell repertoire. The extra skill point is icing on top as your don&rsquo;t have a lot of skill points to spare.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Out of the rest of the Core races, Gnome and Halfling take second place...with Elf behind them. The slow speed of Gnome and Halfling don&rsquo;t mean much as when you use metamagic you only get a 5 foot step. &nbsp;Plus at higher levels you get to fly or teleport via your spells. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Elves.</span><span>&nbsp;Boost to Dexterity and Int, which are secondary stats. &nbsp;Penalty to Con, which hurts. </span><span class="c0 c6">Longbow proficiency</span><span>, which doesn&rsquo;t mean much, but you can trade that in for </span><span class="c0 c5">Arcane Focus</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;gaining a +2 on concentration checks which is better. And you get a racial +2 to spell penetration which means a lot since most evocation spells worry about SR. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Halfling.</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Boosts to Charisma and Dexterity. Penalty to Strength which makes you Shadow bait. Small size which is a mixed blessing. You are slower (unless you take the Fleet of Foot alternate racial trait). But your small size also grants you +1 to hit (more important in ray focused builds), +1 AC, and +4 Stealth. Racial skill bonus to Perception is handy. The racial +1 to all saves is very nice. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Gnome.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span>Boosts to Charisma and Constitution. You can drop your pre-racial Con to 12 which free up another 3 stat points. &nbsp;Penalty to Strength which makes you Shadow bait. Again small size which has the usual mix of benefits and penalties. Amazing alternate racial trait </span><span class="c0 c5">Pyromaniac</span><span>&nbsp;if you decide you like </span><span class="c2 c0">Fire</span><span class="c3">. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Other races of note. Most are not available unless you have a boon. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Aasimar. Not PFS legal without a boon. If you have the Blood of Angels sourcebook some of the subraces (bloodlines) offer some decent alternate choices. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Tiefling. As Aasimar...but the base race as well as many of the subraces (Blood of Fiends) have a penalty to your main stat. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Ifrit.</span><span>&nbsp;Not PFS legal without a boon. </span><span>Boosts to Dexterity and Charisma. Good if you like elemental(fire) bloodline. Also access to alternate racial trait </span><span class="c2 c0">Wildfire Heart</span><span>&nbsp;which is a nice bump if you are trying to maximize your initiative. </span><span class="c0 c5">Darkvision</span><span>&nbsp;is also nice. Better with Elemental(Fire) Bloodline. Free Burning Hands 1/day and </span><span class="c2 c0">fire resistance</span><span class="c3">. </span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">5.Traits</span></p><p class="c1"><span>There are two key traits in Pathfinder for blasters. &nbsp;One is called </span><span class="c0 c5">Magical Lineage</span><span>. The other is </span><span class="c0 c5">Wayang Spellhunter</span><span class="c3">. How they work is that they effectively reduce the spell slot taken by a metamagicked spell by 1. Combined (FAQ&rsquo;d and legal in PFS) that&rsquo;s 2 spell levels taken off the top. &nbsp;You cannot reduce a spell below it&rsquo;s original spell level. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c5">Magical Lineage</span><span>. Magic. Pick one spell. When metamagic is applied, it&rsquo;s effective spell level is reduced by 1. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c5">Wayang Spellhunter</span><span class="c3">. Region. Select a spell of 3rd level or lower. When used with a metamagic feat it&rsquo;s spell slot is one lower than normal. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Other traits of note:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Reactionary</span><span class="c3">. Combat. +2 trait bonus to initiative. Helpful for going first. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Eyes and Ears of the City</span><span class="c3">. Religion. +1 trait bonus to Perception and it becomes a class skill. &nbsp;Requires Abadar worship. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Observant</span><span class="c3">. Faction. +1 trait bonus to Perception and it becomes a class skill. &nbsp;Requires Grand Lodge.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Indomitable Faith</span><span class="c3">. Faith. +1 trait bonus to will saves, arguably the most important save in Pathfinder.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">6.Feats</span></p><p class="c1"><span>As an overall power increase, </span><span class="c0 c5">Varisian Tattoo</span><span>&nbsp;is essential. However this requires </span><span class="c2 c0">Spell Focus</span><span>, which means unless you are human, you don&rsquo;t get this until 3rd. However there&rsquo;s a way around this...see Tattooed Sorcerer under Archetypes. </span><span class="c0 c5">Spell Specialization</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">is an amazingly powerful feat. &nbsp;Between Spell Focus, Spell Specialization and Varisian Tattoo, you have the foundation of your blaster build. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Your starting feats:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Spell Focus</span><span class="c3">&nbsp; +1 to saving throw DCs of spells from your chosen school. Pretty vanilla, but a prerequisite for other key feats, so you&rsquo;re taking this no matter what. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c5">Spell Specialization</span><span class="c3">&nbsp; Requires Spell Focus and Int 13. +2 caster levels to a specific spell is awesome enough. What is absolutely amazing is that you get to change what spells this ties to, making this feat eminently practical for your character&rsquo;s entire career. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c5">Varisian Tattoo</span><span class="c5">&nbsp; </span><span class="c3">+1 caster level to a chosen school (Evocation of course). Plus you gain an extra cantrip 3/day. In the case of Evocation, it&rsquo;s Dancing Lights. You are taking this or gaining this via the Archetype. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Metamagic feats. Way to enhance your booming: </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">First decide on Empower or Maximize. Both are good, but having both is too much of a drain on your precious feat slots. Empower can be used earlier, but provides a lower mathematical benefit than Maximize. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c5">Empower Spell</span><span class="c3">: A flat 50% increase (or 1.5x multiplier if you prefer) for your damage spell. Mathematically inferior, but it fits amazingly well when your signature spell has both the Wayang Spellhunter and Magical Lineage traits applied to it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c5">Intensified Spell</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Raises your dice cap for spell by 5 dice. &nbsp;Useful early with spells like Burning Hands and later on as you&rsquo;ll be pushing the Fireball 10 dice cap sooner than you think.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c5">Maximize Spell</span><span class="c3">&nbsp; No need to roll damage dice again. However hefty at a base +3 spell slots. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c6">Merciful Spell</span><span class="c3">&nbsp; Wait you want to what? &nbsp;Take prizzners...what is this word...prizzner? Nice concept but again, takes one of your precious feat slots and there are other spells that incapacitate without melting their face...check out the God Wizard academy across the university grounds. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Persistent Spell</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;What&rsquo;s better than +1 DC to your spell? Making them all roll twice and taking the worse one! You probably don&rsquo;t have room for this feat though.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Quicken Spell</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;What&rsquo;s better than one massive fireball a round? &nbsp;Two of them! You&rsquo;ll take this eventually. &nbsp;Green because even with the spell slot cost reduced it&rsquo;s still a base +4 spell slots. You&rsquo;ll be nearing the end of your PFS career before you get this. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Selective Spell</span><span>&nbsp; In a setting known for completely random PUGs with no coordination, you want this feat. &nbsp;Unfortunately it&rsquo;s prerequisite of 10 ranks in Spellcraft means by the time you get this, it&rsquo;s almost over and you&rsquo;re probably taking </span><span class="c2 c0">Quicken Spell </span><span>anyway. Buy a metamagic rod instead. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Dazing Spell</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;So powerful it&rsquo;s broken. However it&rsquo;s a non-damaging control feat so green for our purposes. Still honorable mention as this feat is way awesomesauce if you don&rsquo;t want a foe just plain vaporized. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Elemental Spell</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;If you want some diversity on your spell elements, or alternatively switch one to your preferred element, here&rsquo;s an option. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Other feats of note.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Great Fortitude</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Boost that yucky Fort save.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c5">Improved Initiative</span><span class="c3">. +4 to your initiative makes it more likely you can lay the pain down before your melees all charge in and mix it up. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lightning Reflexes</span><span class="c3">. Ditto for that Reflex Save.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Spontaneous Metafocus</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Hate charging up that nuke and being stuck in place? Take this feat and pumping a spell becomes a standard action. Requires cha 13+ which you better have! and a metamagic feat already known. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c6">Toughness</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp; </span><span class="c3">A ready staple feat of those who choose squishy classes. However you don&rsquo;t care about this because you&rsquo;d rather overwhelm with the force of your personality rather being a punching bag. Not really worthwhile, even at 1st level if you are a purist, though take it if you are paranoid and then retrain out with your free retrain once you hit 2nd. If you&rsquo;re going to make a barbarian with massive hit points to get past the first 3 adventures then yes...but you&rsquo;re in the wrong guide. &nbsp; Besides you have a 14 con...you did pick a 14 con right? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c6">Irrisen Ice Mage</span><span class="c3">&nbsp; Let it go...er snow! Let it snow! +1 caster level on cold spells, which is keen, -1 on all other elements, which blows. 3/day cold substitution is a nice perk. &nbsp;Must have Irrisen affinity and only at 1st level. &nbsp;Inferior to Varisian Tattoo, but if you really really want to play that ice queen from that movie by the company of the mouse...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Spell Penetration</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Eventually you will start running into creatures with SR. This helps you get by it. Or you could cast a spell that doesn&rsquo;t worry about SR. </span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>7.Bloodlines</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">There&rsquo;s really not many options here. &nbsp;A great deal will depend on your concept. Starting with Core choices if you want to focus on a specific element, than Draconic is a good choice. Elemental comes with a better spell list and the option to switch elements on the fly. Arcane is as always a solid choice because it&rsquo;s loaded with goodies, albeit with a more general focus. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Beyond Core, Orc is pretty much one of the best. &nbsp;Flat damage bonus independent of element, darkvision which you don&rsquo;t miss until you really need it, and even defense boosts. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Core bloodlines.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c5">Arcane</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Spell list is meh, but expands your general utility. Bonus skill is a knowledge which doesn&rsquo;t hurt. &nbsp;Good bonus feat selection. Bloodline arcana is nice, a free DC boost on most of your blasting when you need it the most (when you pump them up.) Arcane bond is meh with bonded object (though with PFS wealth limits it may come in handy) or great when you choose a familiar. However the 3rd level bloodline power is just amazing. Spontaneous Metafocus with any spell 1/day. &nbsp;Overall still a solid choice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Draconic</span><span>&nbsp;Almost Blue. You gain the best skill in the game </span><span class="c0 c5">Perception</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;as a class skill. +1 per die with your chosen element is good. Good bonus feat selection, you&rsquo;ll have a hard time choosing one. Claws are all but useless, but energy resistance, armor, and eventually wings will serve you well. &nbsp;Unfortunately this bloodline really locks you into a specific element. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Elemental</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c0">Knowledge Planes</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;is a good one to pick up. First three bloodline spells are good...the rest suck. &nbsp;Granted if you are starting with this bloodline at 1st level, then the first bonus spell is actually a waste...you will not want to wait until 3rd for Burning Hands. Out of the bonus feats...Empower Spell is good, followed by Improved Initiative.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Beyond Core.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c5">Orc</span><span>&nbsp;Gain </span><span class="c0 c6">Survival</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;</span><span>as a class skill, um okay, though with only 2+int ranks per level you&rsquo;re probably only going to through 1 rank in this and then forget it. &nbsp;Solid spell list all the way through with again the exception of Burning Hands at 3rd. Bonus feats are meh...probably a tossup between </span><span class="c2 c0">Great Fortitude</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c0 c6">Toughness</span><span>. </span><span class="c0 c5">Bloodline Arcana of +1 damage per die of all your damage spells</span><span>&nbsp;is the best damage booster of all the bloodlines. Orc subtype which won&rsquo;t mean much in PFS, but </span><span class="c0 c5">darkvision</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span>for free will. </span><span class="c0 c6">Light sensitivity </span><span>but you don&rsquo;t have to aim AoE spells.

You&rsquo;re starting at 6th...or wait you are cross-blooded you are starting at 7th. &nbsp;Considering your career is over at 12th level...that is a long time to wait. Besides Tattooed is the archetype that doesn&rsquo;t put you behind, it props you up and keeps giving as you level up. &nbsp;A bit workable with say humans since they can get more spells via their racial favored class bonus. </span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">9.Skills</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">At 2+int per level, there&rsquo;s not much to write about.

Arcane is your only class skill though, barring traits or bloodline choices. The issue is that while YOU know that Red Dragons are immune to fire..your character won&rsquo;t unless you make a Monster Lore check.

Since you are a caster, green. </span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">10.Spells.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">We&rsquo;re going to stick with damage spells primarily. Other spells will be added as an afterthought, but damage is king for a blaster build. Also once you get 4th level spells and beyond many of the synergies break down such as metamagic rod suitability. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">By level.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">0 (Cantrip)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c5">Acid Splash</span><span class="c5">&nbsp; </span><span class="c3">Only 1d3 isn&rsquo;t a lot. On the plus side it bypasses SR. And it is a touch attack. Plus for a measly 10 gp use Acid Flask used as a focus (not used up per casting) adds +1 to damage. &nbsp;If we have a bloodline damage perk as well we are hitting more often than we would with that light crossbow for the same damage, on average. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Ray of Frost</span><span class="c5">&nbsp; </span><span class="c3">As Acid Splash. But it doesn&rsquo;t bypass SR.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Non-booming spells:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c5">Detect Magic</span><span class="c3">. Well yes a staple...but unless you&rsquo;re the only caster in the group, probably someone else has it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Light</span><span>&nbsp;Hands-free torch, but it won&rsquo;t start fires. One per customer. </span><span class="c2 c0">Green</span><span>&nbsp;if you having normal vision. </span><span class="c0 c6">Red</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;if you have darkvision. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Mending</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Surprisingly useful in PFS. &nbsp;Unfortunately you don&rsquo;t have the space to learn when you start. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c5">Prestidigitation</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Spell with about as many uses as you have imagination. &nbsp;Chill, warm, color, even a weak mage hand effect. Pull a rabbit out of your hat. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Read Magic</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Need it if you plan to decipher scrolls to use them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c0">1st</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Burning Hands</span><span>. Your first area damage spell. Welcome to AoE blasting. You&rsquo;ll be using this before </span><span class="c0 c5">Fireball</span><span class="c3">. &nbsp;Forces you to be a bit close to the front lines, but there&rsquo;s a trick. Cast this spell while hiding directly behind your front line tanks. &nbsp;Cast the spell starting at the 5 foot square ABOVE your meat shield fighter. &nbsp;The cone effect will still hit the baddies in front him without frying your buddy. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Magic Missile</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Always hits, damage scales albeit slowly, multi-targeting. &nbsp;In PFS you&#39;ll run into incorporeal foes where this spell really shines. Worth learning. But at 1st level that cantrip is doing more average damage</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Snowball</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Great single target spell with a chance to stagger. Bypasses SR. &nbsp;But it is Conjuration School. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Non-booming spells worth mentioning:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c5">Mage Armor</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;+4 to your pathetic AC. &nbsp;1/hr per level so a good &ldquo;before we enter the dungeon...or the Blakros Social Event&rdquo; buff. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Shield</span><span class="c3">&nbsp; +4 bonus to AC. Stacks with Mage Armor and grants magic missile immunity. Sadly 1/min per level. Take it if you got Mage Armor coming as a bonus spell...use scrolls or a wand of Mage Armor before then. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c0">2nd</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c6">Acid Arrow</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Anemic damage with poor scaling, single target, requires to hit. No.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Burning Arc</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Interesting spell. Full damage on one target, half on another. Damage scales. Would be blue if it was a true AoE. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Flaming Sphere </span><span class="c3">Decent to start with, plus sticks around. Downside is damage doesn&rsquo;t scale. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c6">Flurry of Snowballs</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;With SR: no, if the damage scaled, this would be a very viable spell. Unfortunately, it doesn&rsquo;t and it isn&rsquo;t. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c6">Scorching Ray</span><span>&nbsp;For </span><span class="c2 c0">Ray specialists becomes Green</span><span class="c3">...requires to hit and scales oddly. But in the end would you rather do 4d6 to a single target...or 4d6 to a bunch of foes? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Non-booming spells worth mentioning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c5">Glitterdust</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Ah yes, reveal invisible and blind them at the same time. &nbsp;Classic control...but we&rsquo;d rather turn them to slag remember?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c7">3rd</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c6">Battering Blast</span><span>&nbsp;For Force specialists. Unfortunately single target and does half the damage of typical damage spells. Also Force Punch is better.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c5">Fireball</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Our first, last, and best destiny. &nbsp;Fantastic range (not that this matters often in PFS) best area coverage, scaling damage. Plus it is 3rd level which means it falls in the sweet spot (i.e. lesser) range for Metamagic rods. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Force Punch</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Like Battering Blast only better scaling (albeit d4) damage and instead of calculating CMD nonsense, we just push a target 1 square per 2 levels, less one square per size category. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lighting Bolt</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Fireball&rsquo;s poor stepchild. Contrary to wishful thinking, most monsters do not group in nice lines for us to fry. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Non-booming spells worth mentioning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c5">Fly</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Because. We really don&rsquo;t need to explain this right? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Haste</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;One of the best battlefield buffing spells. &nbsp;But if your enemy is instead vaporized with your opening spell...why buff?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c0">4th</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">One thing to remember is that lightning bolt or fireball with Intensified Spell occupies the exact same slot and caps at 15d6. So pretty much pass on any of these. And with our spell of choice we can also slap a +2 metamagic via Empower Spell on top of that for another x 1.5 damage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c6">Ball Lightning</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Hey it&rsquo;s Flaming Sphere again. &nbsp;Only now you get 2 or more. &nbsp;I suppose a Large target could have 4 stack on it...but otherwise individually the damage per Sphere is too low. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c6">Dragon&rsquo;s Breath</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span><span class="c3">Scales a little better (12d6 max), but it has that pesky front-line requirement. One the other hand, lightning bolt or fireball with Intensified Spell occupies the exact same slot and caps at 15d6. So...pass.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c6">Flaming Sphere, Greater</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Okay it&rsquo;s Flaming Sphere...again. &nbsp;Only twice the damage...which still does not scale. Sorry, no. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c6">Ice Storm</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Again damage doesn&rsquo;t scale...see a trend? Take for control builds, which we aren&rsquo;t.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c6">Wall of Fire/Wall of Ice &nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Our first Wall spells that do damage...small as it is. Situationally useful, but we&rsquo;re probably better off nuking the site from orbit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Non-booming spells worth mentioning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c5">Dimension Door</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Great &quot;Get me the heck out of Dodge&quot; spell...The downside is unless we take Dimension Agility feat our turn ends right after we cast this. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Emergency Force Sphere</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;The ultimate &ldquo;keep it away from me!&rdquo; spell. On the other hand, it pretty much takes us out of combat, so our teammates may not been so keen on this. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Monster Summoning IV</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Actions are great. Extra actions on our team is better. Plus from this point on we unlock some really keen monsters with nifty abilities. Only Green because we&rsquo;d rather spend out time blowing things up then surrounding them with things with claws. If we find we have extra space to learn a spell, we could do worse. Ditto for higher level versions. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c0">5th</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Note that with a properly upgraded Fireball we&rsquo;re sitting at a cap 15d6 with Maximize or 90 points.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c6">Cone of Cold</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Hey, it&rsquo;s a token spell for our Ice Queen build. Point-blank range which we don&rsquo;t like, better damage scaling which we do. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">One the other hand, lightning bolt or fireball with Intensified Spell occupies the exact same slot and caps at 15d6. So...pass.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Fire Snake</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Interesting spell, kind of a draw your pathway and everyone in that zig-zag takes damage. &nbsp;Same cap as Cold of Cold but you can cast this from further back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lightning Arc</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Sort of like Chain Lightning, only one level earlier. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Non-booming spells worth mentioning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Echolocation</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Blindsight 40. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Fickle Winds</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Stops enemy archers cold. Well, so would melting their face...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">6th</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Chain Lightning</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Now we&rsquo;re talking.
