Although they fill the role of wizards, as the iconic powerhouse for psionics, they play most similarly to sorcerers, oracles, and other spontaneous casters. Your power isn&rsquo;t as infinite as the undisciplined sorcerers gifted arcane magic in their blood or the clerics who beg to gods for divine power, but you can claim your power as your own.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Why use Psionics</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c11">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You play a Psion to bring the full potential of the psionic powers list to bear to crush your weak-minded enemies. Let&rsquo;s talk about the reasons you would choose to use psionics over arcane or divine magic. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Augmentation</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span><span class="c11">- Augmentation allows a manifesters to change the duration, DC, range, and effect of powers by spending more power points when they manifest them. This means that 1st level powers have staying power that will last through an adventurer&rsquo;s entire career.The downside is that, unlike with arcane or divine spells, many psionic powers&rsquo; effects do not automatically scale with level. The upside is that you can custom tailor every power you manifest to the situation at hand.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">No fancy books or holy symbols and no flashy material, vocal, or somatic components required</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Unless you need to direct a ray of energy at someone, or are manifesting a rare power that requires a gold expenditure, you don&rsquo;t need to so much as wiggle a finger to manifest a power. &nbsp;In their place you have displays, which are usually much more subtle, and can be eliminated with a DC 15+power level concentration check. You are not a destroyed book, component pouch, or divine focus away from being useless, and you can manifest your powers much more surreptitiously. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">No</span><span class="c10">va</span><span>&nbsp;- &ldquo;Nova&rdquo; aka to &ldquo;Supernova.&rdquo; Meaning to burn brightly in a massive explosion of force and energy and then completely disappear. Psionicists burn brighter </span><span>than anyone else. Psions </span><span>lose out on the cheap metamagic of spellcasters</span><span>, and get very few automatically scaling powers. In exchange they get multiple powers like </span><span class="c10 c15 c5">schism</span><span>&nbsp;that let them bend</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;and break the action economy as augmentation let&rsquo;s them push the limits of their power with every manifestation. GMs would be wise to force any psion to face multiple encounters a day. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Versatility </span><span class="c11">- The Psion/Wilder power list is very diverse both in and out of combat. Psionic classes have very strong personal buffs, great blasting, and good area control to go along with good transportation and information gathering abilities, and even a couple of personal healing spells in a pinch. All of which can be freely augmented to made more powerful when you need them to be. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Active Energy Types</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c11">- This is what makes psions such incredible blasters compared to a wizard or sorcerer. If a wizard has scorching ray prepared, and runs up against a fire elemental, he better hope that he has a way to change the energy type of that ray, probably through expensive metamagic, or scorching ray is going to be completely useless. The Psion takes a full round action to change his active energy type from fire to cold, and he suddenly goes from helpless to targeting a creature&rsquo;s vulnerability.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c7">Psion Ability Scores</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Strength</span><span>&nbsp;- One of your two dump stats. As a medium character you shouldn&rsquo;t put more than 12 in here, and as a small character you won&rsquo;t need more than 10. If you plan to wear armor, you don&rsquo;t want to dump this too heavily. If you&rsquo;re playing a gish psion then there are new 1st and 3rd party options that let you avoid strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Dext</span><span class="c14 c10">erity</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;</span><span>- Your most important stat after Int and tied with constitution. It boosts your AC, ranged attacks, and helps you go first. This nears </span><span class="c14 c10">blue</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c11">if you&rsquo;re playing a direct-damage/ray focused psion. You want a bonus to it, but races with a bonus to dexterity are easy to come by so you don&rsquo;t need to invest too heavily into your point buy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Constitution</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- This is the second or third most important stat for most classes in the game, Psions included. You only have a d6 hit dice, and your fortitude save is bad. 12 is the absolute minimum for this after racial modifiers.. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Intelligence </span><span>By far and away your most important ability score unless you</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>r</span><span>e</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;a Gish psion. This determines your DCs, the number of extra power points you get every level, and skill points. Races with floating ability score bonuses put them here. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Wisdom </span><span>- You have a good will save, but getting more points into that won&rsquo;t hurt, and wisdom influences perception and sense motive. You&rsquo;ll need a 13 so that you can get the feat psionic meditation. Don&rsquo;t let this one drop to </span><span>negatives</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Char</span><span class="c8">isma</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c11">- Your second dump stat. Unless you are playing a telepath as a face or have some other reason for wanting to use your social skills, an 8 will be high enough. Use your skill points and powers to get around the low bonus. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c11">A point buy should usually prioritize your ability scores in the following order</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Manifester Psion</span><span>&nbsp;- </span><span class="c14 c10">Int</span><span>&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="c6">Con</span><span>&nbsp;or </span><span class="c6">Dex</span><span>&nbsp;&gt; </span><span class="c10">Wis</span><span>&nbsp;&gt; </span><span class="c2">Str</span><span>&nbsp;&gt; </span><span class="c22 c2">Cha</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Dex Gish Psion</span><span>&nbsp;- </span><span class="c14 c10">Dex</span><span>&nbsp;&gt; </span><span class="c6">Con</span><span>&nbsp;&gt; </span><span class="c6">Int</span><span>&nbsp;&gt; </span><span class="c10">Wis</span><span>&nbsp;&gt; </span><span class="c8">Str</span><span>&nbsp;&gt; </span><span class="c22 c2">Cha</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Strength Gish Psion</span><span>&nbsp;- </span><span class="c14 c10">Str</span><span>&nbsp;&gt; </span><span class="c6">Con</span><span>&nbsp;&gt; </span><span class="c6">Int</span><span>&nbsp;&gt; </span><span class="c10">Dex</span><span>&nbsp;&gt; </span><span class="c8">Wis</span><span>&nbsp;&gt; </span><span class="c22 c2">Cha</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Face Psion</span><span>&nbsp;- </span><span class="c14 c10">Int</span><span>&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="c6">Con</span><span>&nbsp;or </span><span class="c6">Cha</span><span>&nbsp;&gt; </span><span class="c10">Wis</span><span>&nbsp;&gt; </span><span class="c10">Dex</span><span>&nbsp;&gt; </span><span class="c22 c2">Str</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c7">Example Stat Arrays</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Before racial adjustment and assuming a bonus to Int.

I think it&rsquo;s feasible with a 25 point buy, but would highly advise against it otherwise. It&rsquo;s more feasible if your character is starting at high levels. Gish builds are going to struggle with less than a 20 point buy, and would be wise to look for ways to apply their dexterity to damage in place of strength to make themselves less MAD. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c19 c10 c25">Roles the Psion Can Fill</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c7">In Combat</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Area Control</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;-. You don&rsquo;t have the iconic effects that wizards get like grease, cloudkill, or black tentacles, but you can still get powers that will make you great at this. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Buffing</span><span>&nbsp;- Psions are </span><span class="c14 c10">great</span><span>&nbsp;at buffing themselves at the start of the day, but are only </span><span class="c10">average</span><span>&nbsp;when it comes to helping out their teammates. The shared buff feat is helpful, but isn&rsquo;t enough. Egoists are </span><span class="c10 c15">incredible</span><span>&nbsp;at buffing themselves and are </span><span class="c6">better than average</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;at buffing their allies due to their discipline abilities and powers, though. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Dealing</span><span class="c14 c10">&nbsp;Damage </span><span>- Any psion can be a </span><span class="c6">good</span><span>&nbsp;direct damage dealers if that&rsquo;s your thing. Kineticists are </span><span class="c14 c10">great</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;at this; they&rsquo;re some of the best direct damage dealers in Pathfinder.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Debuffing</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- You&rsquo;re alright at this, but a massive amount of your debuffs are going to target the Will saving throw and a large amount are also mind-affecting. If you focus on debuffing enemies, you want to be able to target a variety of savings throws, and mind-affecting abilities scale poorly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Summ</span><span class="c6">oning</span><span>&nbsp;- Shapers are </span><span class="c14 c10">great</span><span>&nbsp;at this, and psions who make the feat investment do it </span><span class="c6">well</span><span>.</span><span>&nbsp;The feat investment is minor, but without it non-Shapers </span><span class="c2">can&rsquo;t do it</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;at all</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Tanking</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c10">Damage</span><span>&nbsp;- Psions are surprisingly sturdy, especially at early levels. </span><span class="c5">Vigor</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c5">inertial armor</span><span>&nbsp;start good and only get better once you augment them, and the </span><span class="c5">share-pain</span><span>&nbsp;+ psicrystal combo makes psions very hard to put down. Unlike with spellcasting, you can wear armor without penalty to your manifesting. The d6 hit dice holds you back, but you&rsquo;re much less squishy than Arcane casters. The unique abilities and powers Egoists get makes them </span><span class="c10">average</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;at this role.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Out of Combat</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Hea</span><span class="c8">ling</span><span>&nbsp;- Psions can do a little bit when it comes to removing status effects, and Egoists can </span><span class="c8">somewhat</span><span>&nbsp;handle their personal healing, but that&rsquo;s about it.. There are better things to be done with your abilities, and other characters who would be better at it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Gathering Information</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span>- You get all of the knowledges as class skills and Int is your primary attribute. Psions are going to have lots of powers available to them to help here, with Seers specializing in this role. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Party</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">Face</span><span>&nbsp;- You have some powers to make you better at this, and the extra skills to invest in this area, but you don&rsquo;t have the class skills or power access to be great at it. Telepaths get both of those, and that pushes them to </span><span class="c6">good</span><span class="c11">, but not great due to their low charisma. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Scouting an</span><span class="c14 c10">d Espionage </span><span>- Your generic psions is </span><span class="c6">strong</span><span>, especially with a psicrystal or some other proxy at their disposal. This is where Seers are </span><span class="c14 c10">great</span><span>&nbsp;due to divination effects, and Telepaths are </span><span class="c14 c10">great</span><span>&nbsp;with charm and compulsion powers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Transpo</span><span class="c14 c10">rtation</span><span>&nbsp;- Nomads are unsurprisingly </span><span class="c14 c10">great</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;at this, and will be proficient in extradimensional travel before other disciplines.

Every power has a display, but not necessarily all the displays. There are 5 kinds: auditory, material, mental, olfactory, and visual. Know which display your power uses because it can allow for much more subtle application of powers. For example, auditory, mental and olfactory displays have options to make it so that the power&rsquo;s manifestation can only be noticed by creatures within 20 ft of the manifester. That is a massive advantage compared to spells which require you to stand yelling and waving your arms, letting everyone know you just cast a spell. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c11">If that&rsquo;s not subtle enough, manifesters can make a DC 15+power level concentration check to eliminate the display from the power entirely. There isn&rsquo;t any penalty to attempting to remove a display, even on a failure. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c19 c7 c31"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c19 c10 c25">Metapsionics: Points vs. Spell Levels</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Metapsionic feats virtually always require you to expend your psionic focus in order to use them. Compared to metamagic, this can make them a tad less useful to use in combat. You can&rsquo;t throw out a quickened empowered </span><span class="c5">fireball</span><span>, and then immediately throw out an extended </span><span class="c5">wall of force</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;without additional feat investment, for example. In exchange, your metapsionics are almost always, effectively 1 power level cheaper after augmentation than metamagic. Empower power only costs 2 extra power points, compared to empower spell costing 2 spell levels. Maximize power only costs 4 extra power points. Lingering power doesn&rsquo;t cost any extra power points. Manifesters will be able to use metapsionics on more power effects than arcane casters will, be able to use them sooner, and can use them more efficiently. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c11">Because you&rsquo;re using power points and not spell levels, your ability to use metapsionics is not tied to your highest power level known, but to your manifester level. If you&rsquo;re an 11th level manifester, but for some reason only know 4th level powers (which cost 7 PP to manifest), you can spend 4 more points while manifesting that power on metapsionics.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c19 c7 c31"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c19 c10 c25">Psionic-Magic Transparency</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Now the assumed ruleset for psionics, this makes psionic detection powers much better. </span><span class="c5">Detect psionics</span><span>&nbsp;works on magic and </span><span class="c5">detect magic</span><span>&nbsp;works on psionics. </span><span class="c5">Anti-magic field</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c5">dispel magic</span><span>&nbsp;now counter psionic powers. </span><span class="c5">Dispel psionics</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c5">null psionics field</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;now counter magic spells &nbsp;Dead magic areas and planes are now also dead psionics areas and planes.

The penalty to strength isn&rsquo;t problematic because you&rsquo;re small size, and it comes with a host of other bonuses towards being a manifester. Lackluster favored class bonuses, unless you want to go all-in on mind-affecting abilities</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Dromites</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- These guys and xeph make better wilders than they do psions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Duergar</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Better than dwarves or the other duergar solely because they get abilities that will directly improve your performance as a psion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c14">Elans</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Unfortunately no longer an aberration (charm/dominate person actually scares you now), Elans still get a lot of built-in ways to use their power points to protect themselves. One of the best options available to you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Forgeborn</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Not a bad pick if you want to play a gishy psion, as you get bonuses to your two most important stats, and a penalty to charisma. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Half-Giants</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Forgeborn are a better gish selection than these guys</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Maenads </span><span>- These guys would make better psychic warriors or barbarians in my opinion. They have a very eclectic set of abilities, and I can&rsquo;t really see myself picking them over Elans, Blues, or even Tieflings. I&rsquo;ve never been a big fan of these guys, though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Ophiduans</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Better than undine or vanara because they get the inbuilt bonuses to manifesting, but still not great.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Xephs</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- These guys and dromites make better wilders than they do psions.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c19 c10 c25">General Races</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 179.02px; height: 269.50px;"><img alt="d5942a860902a3dccfa489a76f935ee6.jpg" src="images/image3.jpg" style="width: 179.02px; height: 269.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Half-Elves</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Half Elves are good, but the bonus feats they can get aren&rsquo;t going to be as helpful as psionic talent or the floating one that humans have. Their alternate traits are nice, but there are better alternate traits out there. They may take the human favored class bonus. If you&rsquo;re a gish psion, being able to get proficiency with an exotic weapon (like an elven curve blade) can be very helpful</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Half-Orcs</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- An extra standard action before you fall unconscious is fantastic when you can cast spells or manifest powers. They also have an extensive set of alternate racial traits that will be more helpful to you than their base set. They may take the human favored class bonus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Halflings</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- The +2 to dexterity is nice, and you don&rsquo;t take a penalty to Intelligence, but there isn&rsquo;t really anything here for you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Humans</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- The +2 bonus to any stat, the bonus feat, and the extra skill point are great as always. They also come with a great alternate favored class bonus that grants an extra &frac12; power per level.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Elves</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Most of their abilities are built around being an arcane spellcaster, which doesn&rsquo;t help you here, and their alternate racial traits aren&rsquo;t much help either. I really don&rsquo;t like the Con penalty, but the bonuses to Int and Dex are really nice</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Dwarves</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Dwarves have nice racial features, and you take a penalty to dump stats. You could probably do worse, but you don&rsquo;t gain any Int, and aren&rsquo;t even small size.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Gnomes</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- As with halflings, but with a bonus to con and some eclectic abilities.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c19 c10 c25">Featured Races</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 227.50px; height: 347.51px;"><img alt="143466.jpg" src="images/image9.jpg" style="width: 227.50px; height: 347.51px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Aasi</span><span class="c14 c10">mars</span><span>&nbsp;- The base aasimar is </span><span class="c10">average</span><span>&nbsp;without a bonus to intelligence, dexterity, or constitution because Aasimar is simply an incredibly good race with a ton of good racial bonuses and no penalty to ability scores. If your GM would allow a Peri-Blooded variant, then they become </span><span class="c14 c10">great</span><span class="c11">. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Catfolk</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Bonus to Dex, but a penalty to Wisdom in exchange for a bonus to dump stat. Decent racial abilities, but not worth it.

You could do worse.

Not even for your Gish build. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Oreads</span><span>&nbsp;- No bonus to Int, and bonuses to stats you don&rsquo;t really care about. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Ratfolk</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Bonuses to stats that you care about, and penalties to stats you don&rsquo;t. They unfortunately don&rsquo;t have the good racial abilities to set them apart from other strong options.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Sylphs</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Stats to the important stuff, good SLAs, and the outsider subtype set this race above elves in my opinion, but the penalty to constitution still keeps them slightly below the great options. A very good pick, though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Tengus</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Penalty to Con for a bonus to wisdom. Skip.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Tieflings</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- The best race that isn&rsquo;t naturally psionic available for a Psion. Bonuses to Int and Dex, and a penalty to your Charisma. Great general racial abilities out of the box, and the option of trading out fiendish sorcery for a prehensile tail. Lots of options and bonuses here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Undines</span><span>&nbsp;- Penalty to a dump stat, and bonuses to stats you do care about is nice. The lack of a bonus to Int keeps this choice as </span><span class="c10">average</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;at best, even with its good racial traits.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c19 c10 c25">Uncommon Races</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 320.50px; height: 255.00px;"><img alt="cosis-trickster.jpg" src="images/image7.jpg" style="width: 320.50px; height: 255.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Changelings</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Changelings are not a good race for just about any class, and that includes psions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Duergar</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- There&rsquo;s some really good stuff here, but the other Duergar is probably going to make you a better Psion than this guy. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Gillmen</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- You&rsquo;re either water dependent or vulnerable to fire. I can&rsquo;t think of any build guide that recommends these guys. Trash garbage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Gripplis</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- These guys make better ranged psywars than they do psions. You won&rsquo;t lose much, but you won&rsquo;t gain anything significant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Kitsune</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- There are some cool racial traits here, but you&rsquo;re not getting a bonus to Int, and you&rsquo;re getting a bonus to one of your dump stats.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Merfolk </span><span class="c11">- Use skate to get around their movement problems, and then put on a helmet for when people start throwing books at you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c47">Nagaji</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- SKIP</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Samsarans</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span><span>- The bonus to Intelligence is great, but the bonus wisdom isn&rsquo;t really worth the hit to constitution, and their class abilities are better for wizards or clerics who want to abuse the summoner and inquisitor spell lists. The worst pick of all races that get a bonus to intelligence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Strix</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Strix don&rsquo;t get a bonus to intelligence, but they do get something that most psions can&rsquo;t in class get much later than spellcasters without a feat or being a nomad: Flight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c47">Sulis</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Leave this guy in the corner with the Orcs and Nagaji.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Svirfneblins</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- These guys get 8 different racial traits, and modifiers to 4 different ability scores, and somehow none of those things make you directly better or worse at being a psion. They do have spell resistance, which is a bad option for any class that doesn&rsquo;t have reliable self-healing. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Vanaras</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- These guys are with like Undines in that they have good racial traits, a prehensile tail even, but not very good stats. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Vishkanyas</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Oh look, another race with bonuses to dexterity and charisma and a penalty to wisdom. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Wayangs</span><span>&nbsp;- Weird racial traits, but a bonus to intelligence, and bonuses to great skills.

The worst ability you gain is an extra 4 feats over 20 levels. If you gave these power to any other discipline they would be considered overpowered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Bonus Feats</span><span>&nbsp;- Just what you&rsquo;re going to need, more feats. </span><span>Quite a few of these are probably going to become expanded knowledge</span><span class="c11">, but they&rsquo;re still good to have on hand for other, more niche psionic feats. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Breach Power Resistance</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Overcoming power or spell resistance resistance can be a bit of a pain, but with your intelligence modifier behind you, you will be able to blow through it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Double Manifest</span><span>&nbsp;- Obscenely, obscenely good. power. The </span><span class="c5">split mind</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;power gets a purple rating, and this is a better version of that power.

It&rsquo;s probably worth playing around with for that reason, but the limit of the ability to the Psion/Wilder list holds it back. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Bonus Feats -&gt; </span><span class="c10">Daily Power&rsquo;s Known</span><span>&nbsp;- This is a weird ability, but can be a very good one. You lose out on 5 bonus feats, and in return basically get 5 expanded knowledge feats that you can change the power selection of every day. The problem is that you can&rsquo;t take anything off the disciplines&rsquo; power lists, which is what you&rsquo;d normally be doing with those expanded knowledge feats. I&rsquo;d probably rather have the bonus feats, but this ability gets </span><span class="c6">better</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;as your access to power stones increases.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c7">Powers </span><span>- The downside to taking the generalist is that you lose native access to all of the great powers on the individual discipline list. This is why the generalist is rated as </span><span class="c6">good</span><span>&nbsp;instead of </span><span class="c14 c10">great</span><span>. </span><span>You&rsquo;ll be spending a large amount of your bonus feats on expanded knowledge, and larger portions of your WPL on items to shore up your power selection. This discipline will lose most of its luster from levels 7 to 14 when other disciplines are getting the powers representative of their specialization before the greater versions of those powers appear on the main power list, if they ever do.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c19 c7 c31"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c19 c7 c31"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c32 c14 c10"></span></p><a id="id.rduznelj38ae"></a><p class="c17"><span class="c14 c10 c34">Egoist</span><span class="c34">&nbsp;</span><span class="c14 c10 c34">(Psychometabolism)</span><span class="c19 c31 c34">&nbsp;</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 355.00px; height: 228.50px;"><img alt="Kokugyu.png" src="images/image20.png" style="width: 355.00px; height: 228.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c9">Transmogrifiers: More than meets the eye.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c11">On the outside, the egoist might would appear to be focused purely on buffing themselves, and to some degree that is true. However, the powers that they get also offer tremendous utility to a party, and their shared effect ability allows them to also provide in-combat utility by buffing their teammates. The best stuff is frontloaded so egoists should consider taking a prestige class and gaining more class abilities and manifester levels elsewhere. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Discipline Skills</span><span>&nbsp;- Acrobatics is a good skill to have, and heal will be useful at lower levels when healing will be a little pricey. You still won&rsquo;t be great at them, but they&rsquo;re commonly used enough used to be helpful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c7">Abilities</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c11">- The Egoist will get their good powers early, but lose a bit of steam later on. This seems like a prime candidate for prestige classing or multiclassing out of, as you get all the best stuff by level 8. </span></p><p class="c0 c21"><span class="c14 c10">Metabolic Healing</span><span>&nbsp;- Fast healing every time you manifest a power is great, and will add up very quickly as you increase in level. The one downside is that it&rsquo;s tied to the level of a power manifested and not the power points expended. That&rsquo;s not enough to keep it from being </span><span class="c14 c10">great</span><span class="c11">, though. </span></p><p class="c0 c21"><span class="c10 c15">Shared Effect</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- There is a massive number of personal only powers that your allies would love to have, and this lets you give it to them. It counts as an augmentation, so there&rsquo;s a cap to what powers you can do, but it still makes you much more versatile at buffing your party mates. There&rsquo;s a reason &ldquo;personal&rdquo; range spells can&rsquo;t be made into potions. </span></p><p class="c0 c21"><span class="c10">Resilient body</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Critical hits, especially once people start piling effects like bleeding and daze onto them can get very gross. Being able to ignore one of those per day is nice. It&rsquo;s only a 1/day ability, and you&rsquo;ll still be taking damage, though.</span></p><p class="c0 c21"><span class="c10">Infused Form</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- The DR 5/- is nice, but everyone is going to be overpowering that by this point. Adapt Body is also nice, but the duration of the manifested power will already last 20 hours without metapsionics to extend it. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c7">Advanced Egoist Discipline:</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c10 c7">Transmo</span><span class="c14 c10 c7">grifist</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;- </span><span>This is a </span><span class="c14 c10">great</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;discipline to focus on if you plan to be focusing purely on self-buffing or playing as a gish. However, you trade out shared effect, so you lose in-combat utility, so manifesting-focused psions should probably steer clear. </span></p><p class="c0 c21"><span>Shared Effect -&gt; </span><span class="c14 c10">Empowered Alteration</span><span>&nbsp;- A better power for Egoists who wish to focus purely on self buffing. It&rsquo;s a free empowering that applies to even fixed numeric effects to the buffs and powers you&rsquo;ll be manifesting on yourself constantly. However, expending psionic focus is less appealing when you aren&rsquo;t buffing teammates to protect </span><span>you</span><span class="c11">. </span></p><p class="c0 c21"><span>Infused Form -&gt; </span><span class="c14 c10">Infused Body</span><span>&nbsp;- Probably overall a better power than Infused Form, and it will give you a lot of healing when combined with Metabolic healing. The resurrection ability is gravy, but at this level death is already cheap enough that this isn&rsquo;t something most players will care about.</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10 c7">Powers </span><span class="c7">- </span><span>For gish psions, the Egoist disciplines is the </span><span class="c10 c15">best choice available</span><span>. It has great, versatile buffs and healing options to keep you powerful and in the fight. For psions not looking to wade into melee combat, it&rsquo;s still a great discipline. There&rsquo;s some decent healing options available, and most of the powers are very versatile for use in and out of combat.

Until you get to that point, you&rsquo;ll be jealous of what toys the other disciplines get.</span></p><p class="c0 c21"><span class="c6">Active Energy Type</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Not spelled out as a power specifically, but a very nice toy. Unlike every other psion, when you manifest an energy power, you can choose something other than your active energy type. Awesome. Eventually other psions will grab a surge stone, and this is going to lose some of it&rsquo;s luster. </span></p><p class="c0 c21"><span class="c8">Telekinetic Hurl</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- A sling with worse range, and that doesn&rsquo;t add your strength to the damage. It gets better over time, but by the time it does decent damage, you will probably be better off manifesting a cheap power with a better range and hits with touch attack. </span></p><p class="c0 c21"><span class="c10">Kinetic Aura</span><span>&nbsp;- A nice, if modest, persistent buff. Depending on how you look at it, this is either great for saving you money on </span><span class="c5">ring of protection</span><span class="c11">, or annoying because it doesn&rsquo;t stack with the standard defensive buff item.</span></p><p class="c0 c21"><span class="c6">Energetic Recharge</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- The vast majority of abilities that require you to take damage are pretty bad because they require you to take damage. This is not one of those abilities, allowing you to convert and thus ignore massive amounts of damage into power points. It&rsquo;s usefulness is limited as a 1/day ability. </span></p><p class="c0 c21"><span class="c10">Energy Immunity</span><span>&nbsp;- This is a nice boost, but </span><span class="c5">energy adaptation</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;is now providing 30 energy resistance against everything. It&rsquo;s hardly a capstone ability.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c19 c7 c31"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c7">Advanced Kineticist Discipline:</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c7">Unseen Hand</span><span class="c10 c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c11">- You lose two good abilities, and gain two abilities that are bad.

No-save prone is usually great. Except that you can&rsquo;t designate the ability to ignore your allies, it&rsquo;s once per day, and a range of 30-ft. is terrible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Energy Immunity -&gt; </span><span class="c8">Permanent Telekinesis</span><span>&nbsp;- This is only at most saving you 7 points per manifestation of </span><span class="c5">Telekinetic Maneuver</span><span class="c11">.

You get quite a few great damage dealing powers, and also quite a few powers that deal with wind manipulation. There&rsquo;s a disappointingly low amount of powers that deal with the object manipulation side of psychokinetics. In their place seems to be quite a few powers built around countering psionic attacks like </span><span class="c5">null psionics field</span><span>.

The less often you expect to be hit, the more often you can use it. </span></p><p class="c0 c21"><span class="c10 c15">Accelerated Activity</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- I don&rsquo;t care if this is once per day, this is fantastic. Getting two turns of actions in a single round would open up a massive number of plays for any character, let alone a character that has access to psionic powers.</span></p><p class="c0 c21"><span class="c10">Rapid Movement</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Getting an extra move action, even if it is limited to movement is fantastic because it frees up your other move action to be anything else. It&rsquo;s very good, especially when you consider the discipline ability you get before it. It&rsquo;s still a little underwhelming for a capstone ability, though. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c7">Advanced Nomad Discipline:</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c7">Jaunting</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;- </span><span>I&rsquo;m really torn on this subdiscipline, but I don&rsquo;t think I can recommend it over the base Nomad unless you can reasonably expect to be playing at 20th level.

It&rsquo;s </span><span class="c10">average </span><span>if you plan to do a massive amount of remote viewing.</span></p><p class="c0 c21"><span class="c6">Alter the Waves</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- It&rsquo;s an increasing +3 insight bonus that can be used on &ldquo;any one die roll.&rdquo; A 1/day +3 to anything, including damage is usually great, but insight bonuses are very commonly the bonus provided by psionic powers, so you might have trouble stacking this. </span></p><p class="c0 c21"><span class="c10">Seeing the Connections</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- This is a neat power, but it comes a bit late for the identification bonus to be of much help. The ability to flip the tables on someone scrying against you is nice, but it does allow a save, and shouldn&rsquo;t be used as a replacement for proper defenses against divination.</span></p><p class="c0 c21"><span class="c8">Perpetual</span><span class="c10 c15">&nbsp;</span><span class="c14 c10">Foresight</span><span>&nbsp;- This is a </span><span class="c8">bad</span><span>&nbsp;power if you can&rsquo;t maintain multiple psionic focuses, but becomes </span><span class="c14 c10">great</span><span>&nbsp;if you can. </span><span class="c5">Second chance</span><span>&nbsp;is a more efficient way to get rerolls, and </span><span class="c5">fate of one</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t expend your psionic focus. Perpetual Foresight has larger applications than either of those powers, and doesn&rsquo;t require you to take the second reroll or to expend power points, so it&rsquo;s much better used out of combat than the two powers. </span></p><p class="c0 c21 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c7">Advanced Seer Discipline: </span><span class="c14 c10 c7">Insight</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;- </span><span class="c11">I&rsquo;d recommend that every Seer bridge into the Insight discipline. Insightful steps is worlds apart from Recovered Information in most games and situations, and alter probability will become useful once you have the ability to maintain multiple psionic focuses simultaneously. </span></p><p class="c0 c21"><span>Recovered Information</span><span>&nbsp;-&gt; </span><span class="c14 c10">Insightful Steps</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Unlike recovered information, this ability actually does something. Not only do you get to ignore all difficult terrain as long as you&rsquo;re maintaining a psionic focus, but you can grant that to allies as an immediate action by expending your psionic focus.</span></p><p class="c0 c21"><span>Alter Waves</span><span>&nbsp;- &gt; </span><span class="c10">Alter Probability</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- This is basically a 1/day version of the witch class&rsquo;s misfortune hex. The saving throw scales over time, but expending your psionic focus for the chance to force a reroll is rough. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c19 c7 c31"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Powers</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;- </span><span>If you want to know the answers to all the questions, and you presumably do because you&rsquo;re a seer, then this is the </span><span class="c14 c10">best</span><span>&nbsp;option available to you. Power levels 1 and 3 are pretty weak, but everything else has something good or great for you. If you&rsquo;re not interested in playing detective or scout then there </span><span class="c8">won&rsquo;t be much</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;here for you.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><a id="id.4his65u6r091"></a><p class="c17"><span class="c14 c10 c34">Shaper (Metacreativity)</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 345.25px; height: 252.00px;"><img alt="30d924_5458239.jpg" src="images/image15.jpg" style="width: 345.25px; height: 252.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c9">Bringing you ectoplasmic toys and puppies like a psionic Santa Claus</span></p><p class="c17 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c11">The discipline skills are the only thing that&rsquo;s going to let you down here. Metacreativity gets two great sets of discipline abilities with the constructor advanced discipline, and a great power list. In my experience you&rsquo;ll need to be creative to get the most out of item creation and summoning powers, but that&rsquo;s only because the ceiling is so high.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c19 c31 c34"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c7">Discipline Skills</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;-</span><span>&nbsp;These skills are all over the place. UMD is </span><span class="c10 c15">incredible</span><span>, but Bluff and Disguise are two skills that somewhat overlap, and you won&rsquo;t really be good at either.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10 c7">Abilities</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;- </span><span class="c11">The Shaper&rsquo;s powers make them directly better at what they are doing, or give them more options and ways to use their powers. They are a very nice boon for your psion.</span></p><p class="c0 c21"><span class="c14 c10">Summoner&rsquo;s Call</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Starting out with a very strong ability, an extra round of duration for summoned creatures is pretty solid, but an extra ability is fantastic.</span></p><p class="c0 c21"><span class="c6">Ectoplasmic Protection</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Concealment is good, by the level you get this it should last you an entire combat. Unfortunately you can&rsquo;t break up the rounds, so you&rsquo;ll have to wait for later levels to use it more than 1 time per day. </span></p><p class="c0 c21"><span class="c14 c10">Maestro of Ectoplasm</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- A standard action 1/day power with 3 different, effective ways to help a situation. It&rsquo;s not going to be the equivalent to powers you could manifest at this level, but it doesn&rsquo;t cost power points, either. </span></p><p class="c0 c21"><span class="c6">Astral Ally</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- One of your astral constructs is now permanent. You can still have other constructs out, too. Just a nice way to save power points by letting you create a very powerful construct without worrying that it will just be leaving in 20 rounds.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c19 c7 c31"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c7">Advanced Discipline:</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c14 c10 c7">Constructor</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c7">- </span><span>For shapers looking to focus on creating constructs, this is going to end up being the better option. The bonus feats are nice, as is the ability to summon astral swarms. Most shapers won&rsquo;t gain or lose much only because the base discipline is so g</span><span>o</span><span>o</span><span>d. </span><span class="c19 c7 c31">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c21"><span>Ectoplasmic Protection -&gt; </span><span class="c6">Improved Constructs</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- This is a bit of a lateral move. You lose out on a good personal buff in exchange for some good construct feats that you&rsquo;ll probably already be taking. The feats are usable all day compared to the concealment, so I&rsquo;d say they&rsquo;re slightly better in the long run. </span></p><p class="c0 c21"><span>Maestro of Ectoplasm -&gt; </span><span class="c6">Maestro of Constructs</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>- You lose out on </span><span class="c5">ectoplasmic sheen</span><span class="c11">, and gain a better version of the summoning constructs power and the ability to summon astral swarms. Swarms have their place as annoyances, but you can&rsquo;t modify them to make them more useful as the game goes on. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c19 c7 c31"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10 c7">Powers</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;- </span><span>There is not a single &ldquo;bad&rdquo; power on the metacreativity power list. All of it is good or at least useful with some minor planning or need. You are the only psion to get easy access to summoning, you get creation before arcane casters, and you can create what is effectively a phylactery and the demiplane to hide it in. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c19 c7 c31"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c19 c7 c31"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c19 c7 c31"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c19 c7 c31"></span></p><a id="id.ll4ot6sabqmo"></a><p class="c17"><span class="c6 c34">Telepath (Telepathy)</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 201.52px; height: 243.50px;"><img alt="1367487-telepathy.jpg" src="images/image8.jpg" style="width: 201.52px; height: 243.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c17 c1"><span class="c10 c5 c24 c42"></span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c10 c5 c35">&lsquo;I&rsquo;d like to teach the world to sing, in perfect harmony&rsquo;&hellip;</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;whether they want to or not</span></p><p class="c17 c1"><span class="c19 c43 c10"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c11">The ability to control minds is probably what people first imagine when they think of psionic powers. Telepaths are the choice for players who want to do that. Good discipline skills for manipulating others, good discipline abilities, and a power list filled with both save-or-die effects and ways to break the action economy. Just be prepared to be really annoyed by the undead, constructs, paladins and other folks who ignore your charms and compulsions.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c19 c31 c34"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Discipline Skills</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;- </span><span class="c11">All the face skills you will want are here, minus intimidate. Diplomacy is the gem, but Sense Motive and Bluff can also serve important roles, and they synergize well with the discipline&rsquo;s focus on charms and compulsions. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c19 c7 c31"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Abilities</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;- </span><span class="c11">The standout here is telepathy, but that power isn&rsquo;t going to to always reach its potential. Like with the Egoist, the best discipline abilities here are early in the class&rsquo;s lifespan, and it wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad idea to look at branching out into a prestige class of some kind.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Mental Intrusion</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- A nice, basically free boost to the DC of your powers is good considering that most telepathy powers are negated entirely by successful saving throws. It&rsquo;s unfortunate that it doesn&rsquo;t stack, though. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Telep</span><span class="c14 c10">athy</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- I want to rate this power very highly, but it&rsquo;s not always going to be useful. If you play with a bunch of rowdy, uncoordinated characters who just like to kick doors down, then having completely silent communication isn&rsquo;t going to be helpful. This power could be enough to make you play a Telepath in a mid to high level game that requires even a small amount of espionage or investigation, though. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Last Respite</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- This is mostly useful as a way to avoid having to go through the trouble of paying for a resurrection or raise dead, but only if you can solve the problem within the time limit. By level 14, death has mostly become a revolving door. This is probably an ability that will be more powerful in the hands of the BBEG than a player character.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Guarded Thoughts</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- A +10 bonus against some of the worst effects to fail save against is fantastic, but simultaneously slightly underwhelming as a capstone ability.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c7">Advanced Telepath Discipline:</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c7">Mindbender</span><span class="c10 c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c11">- Most telepaths could transition into this advanced discipline without much concern.Your signature powers are going to be charm and compulsion effects, so being able to make them better isn&rsquo;t much of a loss. Overall the mindbender comes out on top.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Mental Intrusion -&gt; </span><span class="c14 c10">Impose Will</span><span>&nbsp;- I like Mental Intrusion, but I like this even more. The ability to spend 1 more point on a charm or compulsion power is </span><span class="c10">nice</span><span>, but getting a mindlink to your target is </span><span class="c14 c10">great</span><span class="c11">. One of the biggest problems with mind controlling subjects is keeping track of them, and this effectively solves that problem. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>Last Respite -&gt; </span><span class="c6">Enthrall</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- I like this better than last respite. It&rsquo;s basically a freely scaling in save DC Mind Control. It&rsquo;s going to be a bit underwhelming at 14th level because so many thing will be immune to mind-affecting powers, though. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Powers</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span>- Telepaths get a power list with some big peaks and valleys. </span><span class="c5">Mind control</span><span>, </span><span class="c5">schism</span><span>, and </span><span class="c5">empathic connectio</span><span>n are all excellent, but they also gets powers like </span><span class="c5">metaconcert</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;that are only going to be useful when there are other psionic characters in the party or in the game. You are also going to have a glut of mind-affecting abilities that are going to be completely worthless in certain encounters. The peaks are so high that it&rsquo;s still a good list, but the valleys are going to be extremely frustrating.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><a id="id.lhcy89od0eju"></a><p class="c17"><span class="c10 c34">Conduit (Athanatism) </span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 356.50px; height: 260.21px;"><img alt="latest" src="images/image14.jpg" style="width: 461.72px; height: 260.21px; margin-left: -52.61px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c9">thisisacat would like to speak with you now.</span></p><p class="c17 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c11">This discipline, added in Psionics Augmented: Seventh Path is heavily focused on interacting with undead, incorporeal beings, and the ethereal plane. It has a number of worthwhile buffs and information-gathering powers. Much of its power depends on the campaign and how willing you are to use some rather cheesy options. While the powers are somewhat lacking, the discipline abilities are generally strong.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Discipline Skills</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Perception is widely regarded as one of of the best skills in the game. Bluff and Sense Motive give you the ability to play face if you want. You are unlikely to have the stats to be the main face for your party, but perception is always useful.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Discipline Abilities</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- The conduit has a strong set of abilities that help to compensate for its narrow powers, including two powerful combat abilities.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Spirit Affinity</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Negative Energy Affinity is a decent feat, allowing you to throw out nearly irresistible damage at any living creature, but where it really shines is when you have party members who are healed by negative energy. The real gem of this ability is the ability to change a power known daily. This makes the situational powers of this discipline far more palatable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Poltergeist Aura</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- This is a very powerful aura. Without a save, it slows down enemies, prevents attacks of opportunity, and applies a hefty penalty to their attack rolls. The swift action stagger is just gravy. This ability synergizes very well with Athanatism&#39;s defensive buffs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Hand of the Grave</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- This ability is effectively a no-save, just die effect. While it requires a touch attack, a Conduit has a number of options to keep them safe during this, ranging from high AC to possession to incorporeality. This will kill nearly any opponent without even trying.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Straddling Both Worlds</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Incorporeality is a powerful defense, especially against more monstrous opponents. However, by this point, a conduit has many other ways of acquiring the status, reducing the utility of this ability. Still, the free ghost touch is still nice. This ability falls somewhat short as a capstone after the earlier strong showing.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c37 c10">Powers</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- While rather flexible, the conduit list has a lot of horribly situational powers. The strong powers are amazing, but there aren&#39;t very many of them. In addition, many of the strongest powers are somewhat awkward from a roleplaying perspective. If you&#39;re alright with playing a &nbsp;creepy character who uses a few more generalist powers, this is fine, but it could cause some complications otherwise.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c16 c10">Tools of the Mind: </span><a id="id.jyshqn58lqec"></a><span class="c16 c10">Class Skills </span></p><p class="c17 c1"><span class="c19 c10 c43"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c7">Universal Psion Class Skills</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Autohypnosis</span><span class="c11">* - &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll put at least 4 points into this skill for the psionic meditation feat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Craft</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- It&rsquo;s an Int based skill, so you can probably get some use out of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Knowledge (Arcana)</span><span class="c11">** - Dragons and magical beasts are the big gets here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Knowledge (Dungeoneering)</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Aberrations tend to be pretty common.

Also notable if you want to grab Martial Training for a Stance or Boost.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Knowledge (Nature)</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- There are a ton of creatures here that you&rsquo;ll want to identify. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Knowledge (Nobility)</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Look at the face printed on your gold coins.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Knowledge (Planes)</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Useful when you plan on venturing outside the normal planes or binding Efreeti.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Knowledge (Psionics)</span><span class="c11">* - Not useful unless you plan on facing lots of psionic monsters. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Knowledge (Religion)</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Undead and divine interference are very common and very diverse.

The Cha-based characters will be better at it, though. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Disable Device</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;(Kineticist) - Your party will probably need someone to do this, and you could be good at it, depending on how much you invest into dexterity. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Disguise</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;(Shaper) - Disguise often takes a lot of preparation and scouting to pay off. Just use acrobatics to jump the fence, bluff to lie to the guard, diplomacy to get a ticket, or buy a paper bag to put over your head. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Escape Artist</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- How you&rsquo;ll get out of grapples with your bad BAB. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Fly</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;(Nomad) - You&rsquo;ll need it eventually, but shouldn&rsquo;t need to put more than 10 ranks into it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Heal</span><span>&nbsp;(Egoist) - Heal is only situationally useful.

It&rsquo;s always annoying when the BBEG or their lackey is able to deceive the party into wasting their time or helping him. Also useful in gaining information</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Stealth</span><span>&nbsp;- You don&rsquo;t get any powers like </span><span class="c5">invisibility</span><span class="c11">, like arcane casters do, so you&rsquo;d be wise to max this skill out if you plan on playing a sneaky character. A psicrystal will be better at this than you for a while, though. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Survival</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;(Nomad) - You only need 1 member of the party to have this, if you even need that much. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Swim</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;(Nomad) - You&rsquo;re only going to put on point into this to get the class skill bonus, if that much.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c15">Use Magic Device</span><span class="c11">** (Generalist, Shaper) - An incredible skill for characters with powers known limits.

Not a very good powergaming archetype, but it definitely gives you some options if you want to play a psion trying to fit in a more magical work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Arcane Trappings</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- You give up your psionic displays, which are good, gain verbal and somatic components, which suck, and can&rsquo;t wear armor without having to deal with arcane spell failure anymore. The spell failure won&rsquo;t be as bad for you as it would be if you were a magic user.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Mysterious Magic</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Most of the time the city guard won&rsquo;t have ranks in the skills required to identify your powers, and the wizard is going to pass it on a ten regardless. This might be fun for an NPC to have in a game, but it won&rsquo;t be useful. It&rsquo;s free, though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Strange Synergy</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- You get a free, but piddly bonus to overcome spell or power resistance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c7">Mystic Bond</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- You get a familiar instead of a free floating feat. I personally think that psicrystals are generally better than familiars, and this forces you into having one. You still keep the ability to take psicrystal containment, though. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c25">Bombardier</span><span class="c25">&nbsp;- </span><span>Your schtick is that you turn crystals into bombs and then throw them at people.

You give up your entire discipline power list, and discipline abilities in exchange for throwing alchemical weapons bombs that deal your Int+1d6*Level/2 damage in whatever your active energy type is. This would be better if alchemical weapons weren&rsquo;t pretty bad in Pathfinder, psychokinesis wasn&rsquo;t an available discipline, and psions weren&rsquo;t already more than capable of dealing damage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7">Talents</span><span class="c7">** - </span><span>Ultimate Psionics doesn&rsquo;t make mention of discipline talents outside of the table.

You cast powers from disciplines from other than your chosen two at </span><span class="c2">-1 manifester level</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c8">lose all your discipline class skills</span><span class="c11">. Choose wisely. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Secondary Discipline Ability</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;- </span><span>There are quite a few </span><span>disciplines</span><span>&nbsp;that are better than feats, especially considering you&#39;re </span><span>relatively</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;slim selection. The egoist, transmogrifist, telepath, mindbender,insight, shaper and constructor are all good candidates for disciplines to draw secondary abilities from.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c25">Mindwright</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Ask your GM before taking Mindwright, and discuss possible side effects. Crafting is a very hard thing for most GMs to deal with properly. Left unchecked, it will break a campaign&rsquo;s economy. If they don&rsquo;t implement crafting, or there isn&rsquo;t significant downtime, then players are left with tons of dead feats. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7">Class Skills</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;- </span><span>You of course get </span><span class="c10 c15">UMD</span><span>, but you also &ldquo;get&rdquo; </span><span class="c8">craft</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c2">profession</span><span class="c11">, which you already had. Most psion disciplines are going to do better. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7">Bonus Feats</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;- </span><span class="c11">You get the Generalist&rsquo;s bonus feats, but now they must all be crafting feats. There simply aren&rsquo;t that many standout crafting feats for psions. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Trained Artisan</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;- </span><span class="c11">Crafting checks, especially of magical or psionic items, can have rather large DCs. Getting something to pump up your skill check is helpful. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c7">Efficient Artisan</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;- </span><span class="c11">Crafting is already an efficient way to get equipment by design. This only makes it even more so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7">Psionic Identification</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;- </span><span>With a high spellcraft skill, and the ability to get a free bonus to identification with detect psionics, you weren&rsquo;t going to have problems anyway</span><span class="c19 c7 c31">. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Greater Ectoplasmic Creation</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;-</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;Ps and SLAs are cool, but less so when you get them 5 levels after you could have had the actual power or spell. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7">Psionic Infusion</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;- </span><span class="c11">This is a tricky one to rate. It theoretically lets you bypass the enhancement limit on magical or psionic for a single item or weapon, and can be done more than one time per day. However, it&rsquo;s going to be every expensive in terms of power points (a +3 enhancement will cost 36 power points), and it only lasts for 1 minute. Your most common uses of this will be for situational +1 enhancement abilities. That&rsquo;s just not worth it in my book.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2 c25 c41"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c41 c2 c25"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c25">Hounforge </span><span class="c7">(From the Seventh Path) - </span><span class="c11">This is a pretty weak archetype that sees you trade your discipline for a gimped eidolon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c7">Dollmaker</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;- </span><span class="c11">While this ability doesn&#39;t cost anything, it is also nearly useless. The only point of this ability is to allow you to make your spirit doll without needing more than one rank in Craft.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c7">Spiritforged Companion</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;- </span><span class="c11">While an eidolon is usually powerful, the Hounforge has a set of limitations that greatly weaken it. First and foremost, the eidolon operates at half the psion&#39;s level. This means that past the earliest levels, it will be all but useless in combat. Second, it is limited to the host form, preventing it from taking powerful evolutions like pounce. Finally, the bond powers are far weaker than the similar powers possessed by the summoner. All-in-all, this is much weaker than a discipline.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c7">Spirit Doll</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;- </span><span class="c11">This generally just acts as a point of weakness for the Hounforge. It does allow touch powers to be manifested at range on the eidolon, but it&#39;s still not much.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c19 c10 c25"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c19 c10 c25"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c25">Ascendent Psion </span><span class="c7">(Elan Only) - </span><span class="c11">This is less of an archetype and more of an alternative discipline. The discipline focuses on providing access to all of the iconic psionic abilities. It&rsquo;s all about telepathy and disguising teh character&rsquo;s true nature. It&rsquo;s weaknesses are that it doesn&rsquo;t bring anything remarkable to the table.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Skills</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Perception is obviously fantastic, but Disguise isn&rsquo;t quite so great. It synergizes with the level 8 ability at least.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c11">Talents - Far hand, missive, and telekinetic punch are solid pick ups. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Ascendent Powers</span><span>: Effectively the discipline power list. </span><span class="c5">Control body</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c5">mind control</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;are the biggest gains here. All but one power is at least solid, and it&rsquo;s a nice diverse list.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Hide Mind</span><span class="c10 c59">&nbsp;</span><span class="c11">- This is useful in a setting where psions are hunted, but is otherwise unremarkable. There are far worse things to be noted as than psionic or magical.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Assume LIkeness</span><span>&nbsp;- </span><span class="c5">Disguise Self</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;at will. You&rsquo;ll need to invest in disguise to really get something out of this, but it&rsquo;s still a great get at level 8.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Telekinetic Force</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Telekinetic force is a good power. It&rsquo;s not such a good PsiLA because it&rsquo;s saving throw will be Cha based. It&rsquo;s also only a 3rd level power, and you can already spam that all day if necessary.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Ascension</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- You become incorporeal and gain the ability to manifest Telekinetic force as a PsiLA an unlimited number of times per day. Incorporeal is a good defensive buff in terms of damage, but not at level 20 and not when your charisma will most likely be terrible. You can already spam Telekinetic Force</span></p><p class="c17 c1"><span class="c19 c16 c10"></span></p><p class="c17 c1"><span class="c19 c16 c10"></span></p><p class="c17 c1"><span class="c19 c16 c10"></span></p><p class="c17 c1"><span class="c16 c10 c19"></span></p><p class="c17 c1"><span class="c19 c16 c10"></span></p><p class="c17 c1"><span class="c19 c16 c10"></span></p><p class="c17 c1"><span class="c19 c16 c10"></span></p><p class="c17 c1"><span class="c19 c16 c10"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c19 c16 c10"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c19 c16 c10"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c19 c16 c10"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c19 c16 c10"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c19 c16 c10"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c19 c16 c10"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c19 c16 c10"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c19 c16 c10"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c19 c16 c10"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c19 c16 c10"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c19 c16 c10"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c19 c16 c10"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c19 c16 c10"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c19 c16 c10"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c19 c16 c10"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c19 c16 c10"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c19 c16 c10"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c19 c16 c10"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c19 c16 c10"></span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c16 c10">Bridging the Gap Synapse: </span><a id="id.7clvzj4gdbf"></a><span class="c19 c16 c10">Feats</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c25">Ultimate Psionics</span><span class="c16">&nbsp;</span><span class="c19 c27">(Ratings for feats from Ultimate Psionics provided by Novawurmson)</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c22 c8"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Access Psionic Talent</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;[Psionic] - I mean, if you can really find five talents you want to take, this is a lot of bang for your buck - problem is, you&rsquo;re rarely going to need that many talents.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Advanced Constructs</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;[Psionic] - The higher level Might and Reach menu options are stellar.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Body Fuel</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;[Psionic] - Ability burn is very, very difficult to get rid of. It&rsquo;s not worth tanking all three physical ability scores to recover a little PP.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c15">Boost Construct</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;[Psionic] - You will always be able to find another menu option you&rsquo;d like for your constructs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Combat Manifestation</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;[Psionic] - Being able to cast in</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Deep Focus</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span><span>[Psionic] - Gain a second psionic focus. Getting either this or Psicrystal Containment is basically a requirement by mid-to-high levels - the choice</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c11">comes down to whether you like Psionic Body or Psicrystal Affinity better.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Dispelling Static</span><span>&nbsp;[Psionic] - When you dispel an opponent, they lose psionic focus and take a penalty on saves vs. your powers on their next turn. Dispeling in combat is a niche tactic, but this gives it some </span><span class="c5">oomph</span><span class="c11">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Expanded</span><span class="c10 c46">&nbsp;</span><span class="c10 c15">Knowledge</span><span>&nbsp;[Psionic] - The value of this feat depends entirely on the power you select with it, but due to the way your specialization removes powerful options from your arsenal, you&rsquo;re going to want to take this feat at least a few times. With the sheer amount of PP you will eventually accumulate, your two primary goals eventually become 1) Finding quicker ways of turning that PP into useful effects and 2) Acquiring new, varied, and more useful effects for that PP. This helps with the latter. Discipline powers of disciplines other than the one you chose (</span><span class="c5">astral construct, energy missile, metamorphosis,</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;etc.) and the powers of other classes are a good place to start.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Extra Power Known </span><span>[Psionic] - Expanded Knowledge&rsquo;s cousin. You can get another power off </span><span class="c5">your list</span><span class="c11">, but it can be your highest level known. Situationally useful, especially if your GM is lenient about retraining.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Fast Step</span><span>&nbsp;[Psionic] - Nomad only. Nomad&rsquo;s step as a move instead of standard action, taking that ability from &ldquo;rarely useful&rdquo; to &ldquo;preferred mode of transportation.&rdquo; At level 10, you can move 55ft. as a move action; at 20, you can move 105ft. </span><span class="c5">as a move action</span><span>.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Favored Energy</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;[Psionic] - Bonus damage. If you want to blast, this is a requirement; even if you don&rsquo;t want to specialize in it, it&rsquo;s nice to be able to blast effectively if it becomes necessary.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c15">Improved Metamorphosis</span><span>&nbsp;[Psionic] - A bonus menu option when using any </span><span class="c5">metamorphosis </span><span class="c11">power. You will basically always be able to find another menu option you want.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Improved Psi-Like Ability</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;[Psionic, Racial] - Use your racial psi-like ability an additional 2 times per day. Duergar and ophiduan can make use of this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Improved Psicrystal</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;[Psionic] - The psicrystal options generally aren&rsquo;t worth a second feat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c15">Master&rsquo;s Refuge</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;[Psionic] - Thrallherd only. When you die, your mind transfers to one of your thralls.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Master&rsquo;s Voice</span><span>&nbsp;[Psionic] - Thrallherd only. Permanent </span><span class="c5">mindlink</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;with your thralls - if you really want this, consider playing a collective class.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Metapsionic Mastery</span><span>&nbsp;[Psionic] - </span><span class="c5">One power</span><span>&nbsp;of your choice can benefit from multiple metapsionic feats, burning extra PP instead of spending psionic focus. It&rsquo;s a little too heavily restricted to make a priority in most builds. (SD)* I </span><span class="c6">really like</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;this for blasting focused manifesters though, who are going to have a pet power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Mind Over Body</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Allows you to recover ability burn at a faster rate. Almost all ways of gaining ability burn are self-inflicted. Stop choosing things that give you a horrible condition, and you won&rsquo;t have to worry about recovering from it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Open Minded</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- +1 skill per level. You should be pumping Intelligence, so you&rsquo;ll probably have the skills you need.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Overchannel</span><span class="c20 c10">&nbsp;</span><span class="c11">[Psionic] - Become a mini-wilder, sacrificing HP to increase your manifester level. Now, you will need to spend more PP to get any real effect out of this, but at mid-to-high levels, you&rsquo;ll have the HP and PP to burn to make this an option you&rsquo;ll use a couple times per combat. Amazing if someone in your group has highly efficient healing, like a vitalist or battle medic tactician.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Persistent Focus</span><span>&nbsp;[Psionic] - Your are always treated as </span><span class="c5">maintaining</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;psionic focus for a single ability.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Power</span><span class="c10 c46">&nbsp;</span><span class="c14 c10">Channeler</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;[Psionic] - Turns you into a mini-magus - great if you&rsquo;re multi/prestige classing, bad for a single-classed psion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Power Penetration/Greater</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;[Psionic] - Spell/power resistance (remember, they&rsquo;re one and the same in the default magic/psionics transparency) is generally a nuisance, not a serious issue. It&rsquo;s campaign-dependant - if you&rsquo;re constantly fighting red dragons, drow, or something else with spell resistance, knock this up a couple colors.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Power Perfection</span><span class="c10 c20">&nbsp;</span><span class="c11">[Psionic] - It&rsquo;s Spell Perfection, for psionics. Metapsionic/metamagic cost reduction is ridiculously good, and this feat is no exception.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Power Specialization</span><span class="c10">/</span><span class="c2">Greater</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;[Psionic] - Add a touch of damage to your rays. Power spec is interesting because of the &ldquo;key ability bonus&rdquo; option - at level 4, you could easily have a +7 bonus to your primary stat (18+2 (race)+4 (animal affinity)), giving you an odd nova option.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Psicrystal Affinity</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;[Psionic] - A psionic familiar. Gets really interesting with Psicrystal containment. Psicrystals are really fantastic party scouts, and are rather durable for familiars. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Psicrystal Containment</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;[Psionic] - Gain a second psionic focus. Getting either this or Psionic Body/Deep Focus is a priority, especially at high levels. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Psionic Body </span><span class="c11">[Psionic] - A solid boost to your HP; you already get a bunch of bonus psionic feats, you can get at least one more by playing a psionic race (Wild Talent-&gt;Psionic Talent), and you can generally get away with selecting nothing but psionic feats for your whole career. It&rsquo;s Toughness+ if you&rsquo;re going all psionic feats anyway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Psionic Endowment/Greater</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;[Psionic] - Expend focus to increase the save DC of a power by 1. If you have nothing to do with your psionic focus, this is better than nothing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c15">Psionic Meditation</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;[Psionic] - Recover psionic focus as a move action. At mid-to-high levels, your ideal turn will go: Standard action - power, Swift action - quickened power, move action - recover psionic focus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Psionic Talent</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;[Psionic] - Bonus PP. Interesting at level 1, but it drastically loses steam after that. Play a psionic race if you want a large amount of bonus PP.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Ready Response</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;[Psionic] - Getting more actions is a useful endeavour, and going first often means winning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Swift Shapeshifter/Master of All Forms</span><span>&nbsp;[Psionic] [Psionic] - </span><span class="c5">Metamorphosis</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;as a move/swift action all day, every day. Pretty fancy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Talented</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;[Psionic] - A solid boost to overchanneling. There are plenty of 1st through 3rd level powers that maintain relevance from level 1 to 20; if you like Overchannel, consider this upgrade.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Unlocked Talent</span><span>&nbsp;- Extra Power Known and Expanded Knowledge are basically always strictly better for you than this. Classes that </span><span class="c5">aren&rsquo;t</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;full manifesters with the best power list in the game use this to faintly mimic your powers</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Up the Walls</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;[Psionic] - This is a fun little feat for low-level psions, but it quickly loses its usefulness as better mobility and exploration powers become available.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c7">Metapsionic Feats </span><span class="c7">(</span><span class="c10">**</span><span>Feats rated by Novawurmson)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Burning Power </span><span>[Metapsionic]</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Extremely limited in what you can apply it to, and because it&rsquo;s tied to power level, most you&rsquo;re every going to get out of this power is an extra 18 damage, at level 19. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Burrowing Power</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;[Metapsionic] - Ignore translucent barriers of any kind by shooting right through them. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Chain Power</span><span>&nbsp;[Metapsionic] - The kineticist can probably get a lot out of this power . Imagine </span><span class="c5">energy missile</span><span>&nbsp;jumping around between all of the enemies that were hit with it, for example. The problem is that by paying power points to use the feat, you&rsquo;re capping you potential to augment the damage, as well. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Concussive Power</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;[Metapsionic] - If you find yourself using the sonic energy type, this can be really good. -2 to everything is a good debuff. No saving throw here, unlike sickening. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c15">Dazing Power</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;[Metapsionic] - This is not dazing spell becuase dazing power is a mind-affecting effect. No dazing zombies or vampires. It only costs 2 PP to add onto a spell, though. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Delay Power</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;[Metapsionic] - A way to manipulate the action economy in your favor, but only if you have time to prepare within 5 rounds of the target showing up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Echoing Power</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;[Metapsionic] - This is helpful in terms of power point preservation. The wording is vague, and ask your GM how it interacts with augmentation on the first or second manifestation. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ectoplasmic Power</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;[Metapsionic] - Unless you plan on dealing with ghosts or other incorporeal creatures a lot, you can safely ignore this. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Empower Power</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;[Metapsionic] - The best way to increase the damage of a power, especially when so many points already have you pay 2 points for a damage dice. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">**Endowed Mind</span><span>&nbsp;[Metapsionic] - It&rsquo;s basically &ldquo;heighten&rdquo; for psionics - you can pay PP to increase the save DC of a power. Some powers don&rsquo;t have an innate +2 PP= +1 save DC augment; this will give it to them. Obviously, </span><span class="c5">do not take</span><span>&nbsp;unless you already have a power that needs it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Enlarge Power</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;[Metapsionic] - &nbsp;Double the effective range of a power with no PP cost.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Explosive Power</span><span>&nbsp;[Metapsionic] - </span><span class="c5">Energy ray </span><span>and </span><span class="c5">crystal shard</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;are powers you&rsquo;ll be using often, and this works well with them. It&rsquo;s best used when you can manifest it for free, and it will eat up PP if you target multiple creatures. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Extend Power</span><span>&nbsp;[Metapsionic] - The more you plan to use self buffs, the more you&rsquo;re going to use this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Flaring Power</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;[Metapsionic] - Dazzled is a crappy effect to expend your psionic focus for.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Focused Power </span><span class="c11">[Metapsionic] - You expend your psionic focus to increase the chance your target will fail a save by 10%. Useful if you rely heavily on save-or-die or save-or-suck powers, but you ideally won&rsquo;t be relying on those.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Hustle</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;Power</span><span>&nbsp;[Metapsionic] - You save a couple of points to be able to manifest a power for an action that is more useful than your swift action, in addition to manifesting as a standard action. Unless you don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll be able to get quicken power, this </span><span class="c10">isn&rsquo;t great</span><span>.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Lingering Power</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;[Metapsionic] - Turns your standard blasting effect into a temporary battlefield control spell. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Malleable Power </span><span class="c11">[Metapsionic] - I guess if there is some really important object you want to avoid hitting, this could be useful. Otherwise, selective power is going to be more than enough.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Maximize Power</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;[Metapsionic] - You&rsquo;ll get more out of empower power on average, but there are times when you don&rsquo;t want to know exactly how much damage you&rsquo;ll be dealing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c15">Merciful</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Power</span><span>&nbsp;[Metapsionic] - If your character wants to deal nonlethal damage, for whatever reason, this is </span><span class="c10 c15">fantastic</span><span>. If you&rsquo;re not into that, then you can obviously </span><span class="c2">skip it</span><span>. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Network Power</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;[Metapsionic] - You don&rsquo;t have the class feature prerequisite.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Opportunity</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span><span class="c14 c10">Power</span><span>&nbsp;[Metapsionic] - I </span><span class="c14 c10">love </span><span class="c11">this for melee gish psions, who are going to have the weapon out that lets them act on AOOs. Most manifesters won&rsquo;t get the AOOs and won&rsquo;t want to be in melee in the first place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Persistent Power</span><span>&nbsp;[Metapsionic] - If you are going to live on area of effect blasts, or save-or-die powers, then you </span><span class="c10 c15">must take this</span><span>. If you don&rsquo;t find yourself using them that often, it&rsquo;s still a </span><span class="c38">very good pick</span><span class="c11">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Piercing Power</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;[Metapsionic] - You should be looking to avoid powers that are affected by power resistance. Getting a 25% increase in odds to get through it isn&rsquo;t terrible, though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">**</span><span class="c10 c15">Quicken Power</span><span>&nbsp;[Metapsionic] - Once you hit higher levels, you can bend the action economy over your knee and spank it </span><span>li</span><span class="c11">ke a naughty puppy with this. The power of the psion is the power to nova, and this is one of the key parts of your ability to nova. &nbsp;(SD) You increase the cost of a power by only 6 points, the equivalent of just 3 spell levels. Spellcasters pay 4 levels.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Redirect Power</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;[Metapsionic] - I prefer this to piercing power. It&rsquo;s not as helpful at targeting the BBEG, but it&rsquo;s better for dealing with a group of characters as it lets you double up on spells. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Rime Power </span><span class="c11">[Metapsionic] - If you find yourself using a lot of cold energy, this can be a solid pick. The large advantage psionics have is the ability to use lots of energy types, so you should be able to use it pretty consistently. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Selective Power</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;[Metapsionic] - There are a lot of powers that you&rsquo;re going to want to use this with, especially the bursts that are centered on your characters. You can&rsquo;t get it until level 10, and clever placement can solve a lot of those problems, though. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Shared Power</span><span>&nbsp;[Metapsionic] - There are a </span><span class="c5">ton</span><span>&nbsp;of personal range spells that your allies would love to have. Forcing you to expend your psionic focus, pay 2 more power points, and hit on a touch attack within 30 ft is still really pricey. The touch attack part is what really sours me because it adds risk to buffing, which you&rsquo;re doing specifically because it&rsquo;s so reliable. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Sickening Power</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c11">[Metapsionic] - This is good with powers that automatically hit, or only save for half damage. Just swap to sonic energy and use concussive power, saving the power points and ignoring the saving throw. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Split Psionic Ray</span><span>&nbsp;[Metapsionic] - A </span><span class="c14 c10">great</span><span>&nbsp;feat for characters who like to blast with rays. Other psions </span><span class="c10">won&rsquo;t need it</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;obviously. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Thundering Power</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;[Metapsionic] - Deafened is a lackluster debuff. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Toppling Power</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;[Metapsionic] - If you&rsquo;re a blaster looking for a way to add more debuffs or control to your blasts, this can be a great pick. If you&rsquo;re already doing battlefield control, adding a relatively easy way to make people prone is still good. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Twin Power</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;[Metapsionic] - Persistent power is better than this for save-or-die powers, and you can empower an effect to get more damage. Both are cheaper than twin power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Unconditional Power</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;[Metapsionic] - 8 power points is too steep price to pay. At level 9, you&rsquo;re manifesting a 1st level power, and at level 17, you&rsquo;re manifesting a 5th level power. I doubt whatever power you&rsquo;re manifesting is going to save you. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Widen Power</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;[Metapsionic] - Most areas of effect are already going to be large enough to get the most out of them. You certainly shouldn&rsquo;t need to pay 4 points to double the area of effect. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Item Creation</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Craft Cognizance Crystal </span><span class="c11">[Item Creation] - You&rsquo;re taking a feat purely for the creation of less effective pearls of power. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Craft Crystalline Focus</span><span>&nbsp;[Item Creation] - You aren&rsquo;t a soul knife or an aegis. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Scribe Tattoo</span><span>&nbsp;[Item Creation] - Psionic tattoos are strictly better than potions. Psionic tattoos are also standard action to activate, but they don&rsquo;t require you to draw them out of your inventory. Psionic tattoos also don&rsquo;t have the limitation that you can&rsquo;t make them with personal only powers. Use them to give </span><span class="c5">vigor</span><span>&nbsp;to the Paladin, or </span><span class="c5">touchsight</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;to the druid. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c19 c10 c25">Core Rulebook Feats</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Combat</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Combat Expertise &amp; Maneuver Feats</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- You don&rsquo;t have the spare feats for all of these, and you can&rsquo;t wait 11 levels to get the greater versions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Critical Focus &amp; Critical Feats</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;- </span><span class="c11">You don&rsquo;t have the BAB for it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Defensive Combat Training </span><span class="c11">- This will double the bonus you&rsquo;d be getting from BAB to your CMD, which you will probably want to boost. Take it if you&rsquo;re a melee gish, or have the feats to spare as a manifester.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Deadly Aim</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Ranged power attack. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Dodge/Mobility</span><span class="c10">/Spring Attack</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- This is a large feat chain that doesn&rsquo;t get you all that much. You&rsquo;ll need some of these feats if you&rsquo;re going to be an elocator. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Power Attack</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- The key feat for two-handed weapon gish psions. You&rsquo;ll need to wait until level 3 to get it, and it will scale very slowly now. It&rsquo;s still a low feat investment fighting style, though. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Point-Blank Shot</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- The key feat for archery gish psions. You&rsquo;ll need to wait until level 3 to get it though. One of the better fighting style for Gish psions as it lets them stay out of melee.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Precise Shot</span><span>/</span><span class="c2">Improved Precise Shot</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- You&rsquo;ll probably end up taking precise shot because your BAB will keep you from qualifying for any other feats. Don&rsquo;t let that fool you into thinking it&rsquo;s good, though. You can&rsquo;t take improved precise shot without multiclassing to get a higher BAB and you have psionic powers to that produce superior effects.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Rapid Shot</span><span>/</span><span class="c6">Manyshot</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Rapid shot should be your first archery feat after point-blank shot. Many shot won&rsquo;t come until after level 10, but you&rsquo;re going to need to find ways to get as many attacks with archery as possible. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Weapon Finesse</span><span>&nbsp;- The key feat for rapier, scimitar, or elven curve blade wielding gish psions. If you have an easy way to get dexterity to damage, this route become </span><span class="c6">good</span><span>. Otherwise, it&rsquo;s a </span><span class="c8">pretty bad</span><span>&nbsp;combat style.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Two-Weapon Fighting</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- The key feat for two-weapon fighting gish psions. Probably the worst style to go. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Improved/Greater Two-Weapon Fighting </span><span class="c11">- You don&rsquo;t have the BAB to reasonably get these feats in time for them to be relevant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Vital Strike/Improved Vital Strike/Greater Vital Strike</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- The BAB requirement keeps it out of reach until after you&rsquo;ll have in class ways to increase damage or attacks per round. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">General</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Armor Proficiency Medium</span><span class="c10">/</span><span class="c8">Heavy</span><span>&nbsp;- You&rsquo;ll get more out of </span><span class="c5">inertial armor</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;and other defensive buffs, until you get to impossibly expensive magical heavy armor. If you&rsquo;re going to get armor proficiency feats, go all the way to heavy. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Great Fortitude</span><span class="c2">/Iron Will</span><span class="c10">/</span><span class="c8">Lightning Reflexes</span><span class="c56">&nbsp;</span><span class="c11">- Fort saves are the save most directly related to outright dying, and you have a bad one. Getting a boost to it wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad thing. You already have a good will save, and reflex saves aren&rsquo;t exceptionally important, though. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Improved Great Fortitude/Iron Will/Lightning Reflexes</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Psions can already access powers that grant them rerolls, and they can manifest those more than once/day. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Improved Initiative</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- As a manifester you&rsquo;re going to want to go first so that you can immediately reshape a battlefield to your advantage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c15">Leadership</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- A feat universally acknowledged as overpowered. Recognize that it exists, and then don&rsquo;t take it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Martial/Exotic Weapon Proficiency</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Unless you can get this for free in some way, even gish psions should avoid it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Skill Focus (X) &amp; the +2/+2 skill feats</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- &nbsp;There are very few times you would want to take skill focus, or deceitful/stealthy and other +2/+2 skill feats. Only consider taking it on skills that require opposed checks that you make consistently (perception, stealth, bluff), or have exceptionally high DCs (spellcraft when crafting, use magic device), and only when you have feats to spare. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Toughness</span><span>&nbsp;- You&rsquo;ll want this less than other d6 hd classes, due to your good self buffs and access to psionic body. Still a </span><span class="c6">good</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;feat for gish types, though.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c7">Item Creation</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c19 c27">Psionics Unleashed/Ultimate Psionics modifies a large number of Core Rulebook crafting feats to allow you to make psionic items with them. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c19 c27"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Craft Staff</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Now let&rsquo;s you create psi-crowns. Psi-crowns are not nearly as good as staffs because they take up an equipment slot, and staffs aren&rsquo;t that good to begin with. If you happen to be using Spheres of Power, this gets a lot better because rather than being rubbish multi-scrolls, Staves now become the mage&rsquo;s answer to Magic Weapons. As such, any sphere casters in your party will be begging for them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Craft Wand</span><span>&nbsp;- Now let&rsquo;s you create dorjes. If you have a couple of pet powers that you expect to use daily, especially without augmentation or at a low manifester level, this can be a good way to save power points each day. Examples would be </span><span class="c10 c15 c5">control sound</span><span>, </span><span class="c14 c10 c5">detect psionics</span><span>,</span><span class="c14 c10">&nbsp;</span><span class="c14 c10 c5">inertial armor</span><span>, or </span><span class="c14 c10 c5">share pain</span><span class="c11">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Craft Wondrous Arms and Armor</span><span>&nbsp;- Create psionic weapons and armor. </span><span class="c6">Better</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;for a gish who has the feats to spare, or when in a party with a large number of martial characters. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Craft Wondrous Item</span><span>&nbsp;- Now let&rsquo;s you create universal items. Universal items aren&rsquo;t useful as psionic replacements for </span><span class="c5">cloaks of resistance</span><span>&nbsp;or </span><span class="c5">belts of physical perfection</span><span class="c11">, so it&rsquo;s not quite as strong a feat for manifesters as it would be a spellcaster. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Scribe Scroll</span><span>&nbsp;- Now lets you create power stones. Only let&rsquo;s you save a little on power point expenditure until you get psionic reformation, at which point it becomes a </span><span class="c14 c10">great</span><span>&nbsp;way to have niche powers in your back pocket for when you need them. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c22 c10 c24"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c22 c10 c24"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c22 c10 c24"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c22 c10 c24"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c22 c10 c24"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c22 c10 c24"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c19 c10 c25">Other Paizo Feats</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Combat</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Clustered Shots</span><span>&nbsp;(Ultimate Combat) - You won&rsquo;t have enough attacks to fully take advantage of this, and it will come online a bit late.</span><span class="c22 c10 c24">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Dervish Dance </span><span>(Inner Sea World Guide)</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- How most 1-handed weapon gish psions will get dexterity to damage.

You ultimately give up 2 manifester levels to get </span><span class="c5">true mind switch</span><span>&nbsp;one level ahead of time. If you want to go all-in on switching bodies, or playing some kind of spy character, this is an </span><span class="c6">good</span><span>&nbsp;option, but otherwise it </span><span class="c8">won&rsquo;t do much for you</span><span class="c11">. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c7">Cerebremancer </span><span class="c7">- </span><span>This has the same issues and advantages of the mystic theurge. It takes a long time to get into the prestige class, building towards it </span><span class="c8">sucks at early levels</span><span>, but you get a ton of spells and powers to cast and manifest per day. Cerebremancer probably comes out on top because psionics provides lots of ways to tilt the action economy, letting them take better advantage of their glut of power and spells. This gets to being </span><span class="c6">good</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;at later levels, but it&rsquo;s a rough road to the top. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7">Dark Tempest</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;- </span><span class="c11">This is more for soul knives than it is for psions. You&rsquo;d need to multiclass to get into it, but you won&rsquo;t lose any manifester levels while you&rsquo;re taking it. Not a bad option for a gish build if you&rsquo;re willing to multiclass and lose manifester levels while doing so because you&rsquo;ll gain both mindblade and manifester progression as you advance. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Eloc</span><span class="c8 c7">ater</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;- </span><span>Take three (or two if a nomad) mediocre feats, and give up 3 manifester levels. In exchange you get fold space as a (Su) power, the ability to just float along the ground, hefty discounts to the psychoport and planar travel powers, and the nomad&rsquo;s accelerated activity ability as a capstone. A </span><span class="c6">good</span><span>&nbsp;prestige class for gish psions, and you won&rsquo;t be giving up 9th level powers. Manifesting-focused Psions should probably </span><span class="c8">avoid this one</span><span class="c11">, though.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c7">Metaforge</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- You&rsquo;re not a soulknife or an aegis.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Metamind</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;- </span><span>3 manifester levels is hefty price to pay, but in exchange you&rsquo;ll be getting a massive number of bonus power points, even before you get font of power. Taking this prestige class effectively bars any kind of multiclas</span><span>s</span><span class="c11">ing or being a dual disciple, or you&rsquo;ll be forgoing 9th level powers without the psionic knack trait. The prerequisites are pretty generous, so you can get a capstone equivalent power at level 15. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c15 c7">Meta</span><span class="c14 c10 c7">morph</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;- </span><span>Egoists focusing on metamorphosis should love this prestige class. You don&rsquo;t lose any manifesting levels in your metamorphosis powers, you get free manifestations of metamorphosis, your manifestations of metamorphosis get better, faster, and eventually become permanent. You also gain a d8 hit dice, &frac34; BAB progression and a better fort save. A </span><span class="c10 c15">fantastic</span><span>&nbsp;prestige class for a gish character, and a </span><span class="c14 c10">great</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;choice for your normal egoist.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c7">Mystic Archer</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- You give up all your manifester levels.

You need to have fought a psionic monster, and you better hope you&rsquo;ll be seeing that monster monster type often because you need to make it your primary favored enemy type. This is a </span><span class="c14 c10">great</span><span>&nbsp;prestige class for gish psions, and even an </span><span class="c10">average</span><span>&nbsp;one for psions who get lackluster discipli</span><span>n</span><span class="c11">e abilities after level 10.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c7">Psicrystal Imprinter</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;-</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;Not a bad option for the mindwright archetyped psions, considering that craft feats start to lose their luster pretty quickly. You lose a bit of your crafting ability, and gain some bonuses for your psicrystal.

At that point, it&rsquo;s a </span><span class="c6">relatively good</span><span>&nbsp;return of abilities gained for the two lost manifester levels. Almost no GM considers going to 3.5&rsquo;s epic levels in Pathfinder, so 10 levels in this is a </span><span class="c2">terrible</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;idea. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c7">Pryokineticist</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;- </span><span class="c11">You give up all your manifester levels.

The prerequisites are also extremely light. A </span><span class="c10">decent</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;secondary prestige class for gish psions who have already multiclassed.

The utility of this power is going to make you keep this around for a long time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Natural Healing</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Just straight healing. Egoists will already be healing every time they manifest a power. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Thicken Skin</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- A good defensive buff because it will stack with other armor bonuses if you have any, and your own natural armor bonuses.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c7">Level 2</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Animal Affinity</span><span>&nbsp;- All of the boosts that druids like to use wrapped up into a single power.

Become a construct and enjoy all of those immunities. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c10 c7">Level 9</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Metamorphosis, True</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- As with Metamorphosis Major, the enhancement bonuses aren&rsquo;t going to stack with gear you&rsquo;ll already have</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Regenerative Aura</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Fast Healing 25 is a great effect to put on your friends, except when you&rsquo;ll almost certainly have to expend your psionic focus so that you don&rsquo;t heal the BBEG and his minions at the same time. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><a id="id.wfz7b3aotmo5"></a><p class="c17"><span class="c19 c10 c25">Kineticist (Psychokinesis)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c7">Level 1</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Control Object </span><span class="c11">- Probably good for a couple of comedy spots, but it&rsquo;s damage and duration are both pretty poor. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c7">Level 2</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Control Air</span><span>&nbsp;- Helpful for dealing with projectile weapons, and tiny creatures. Doesn&rsquo;t really give any rules for those abilities, though. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Energy Missile</span><span>&nbsp;- A very good damage power. The one problem you&rsquo;ll have compared to </span><span class="c5">energy ray</span><span>&nbsp;or </span><span class="c5">crystal shard</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;is that this power allows a save. The advantage is that you can have 5 different targets, though they must be tightly packed together.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c7">Level 3</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Energy Cone</span><span>&nbsp;- Psionic </span><span class="c5">cone of cold</span><span class="c11">. If you want to blast, you should grab this. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Localized Windstorm</span><span>&nbsp;- Psionic </span><span class="c5">windwall</span><span class="c11">, with some other potential benefits. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c7">Level 4</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Control Body</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- There are so many awful things that you can do to your enemies with this power. Make the BBEG wizard wade into melee, make the big stupid fighter attack his wizard friend.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Energy Ball</span><span>&nbsp;- Psionic </span><span class="c5">fireball</span><span>, but with more options. You&rsquo;ll probably get more mileage out of </span><span class="c5">energy missile</span><span class="c11">. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Inertial Barrier </span><span class="c11">- Damage reduction 5/- is a nice personal buff, and the duration is good. No cap on how much damage it can absorb. Unfortunately it can&rsquo;t be augmented so it will lose some steam.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c7">Level 5</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Energy Current</span><span>&nbsp;- This does some disgusting damage. Manifest it and just make your targets eat 9d6 damage every round, and then have it arc to someone else. Synergizes very well with </span><span class="c5">solicit psicrysta</span><span class="c11">l.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Fiery Discorporation</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- You&rsquo;d probably rather not have this power come into play. It&rsquo;s also a tad impractical, unless you have a party member that is always carrying an open flame. A good get out of jail free card for villain NPCs, though. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c7">Level 6</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Dispelling Buffer</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- A weird power for the kineticist list which doesn&rsquo;t contain many personal buffs. This is an item gish psions would like to get, and would be a reasonable use of an expanded knowledge feat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Null Psionics Field</span><span>&nbsp;- Psionic </span><span class="c5">anti-magic field</span><span>. I&rsquo;m not actually a big fan of </span><span class="c5">anti-magic field</span><span class="c11">, thinking it often hampers the person who manifests/casts it as much as the people targeting him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c7">Level 7</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Reddopsi </span><span>- I don&rsquo;t like </span><span class="c5">null psionic field</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;much, but &nbsp;at least it&rsquo;s going to protect your friends standing next to you. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c7">Level 8</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Psychokinetic Sphere</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Requires a bit of creativity, but there is a lot you can do with this. Protect and move your friends, separate your enemies, etc. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c7">Level 9</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Tornado Blast </span><span class="c11">- It&rsquo;s a very good blast for late game because it ignores DR and PR/SR, throws your enemy around (regardless of size), and deals upwards of 28d6 (average of 98 damage) to a single target.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c19 c27"></span></p><a id="id.4ztdip65oky"></a><p class="c17"><span class="c19 c10 c25">Nomad (Psychoportation)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c7">Level 1</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Burst</span><span>&nbsp;- You have access to the strictly better </span><span class="c5">skate</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;at this level. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Detect Teleportation</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- There&rsquo;s no reason to grab this when you first gain access to the power. It could be helpful later on as a dorje or power stone, though. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c7">Level 2</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Dimension Swap</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- A really nice battlefield maneuvering trick. Swap places with the fighter if he&rsquo;s out of position. Lure enemies into engaging with a squishy bard, and then trade the bard for a raging barbarian. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Gravitation Well</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Makes a target easier to hit, and your allies harder to hit. A reflex save is required to get away from the effect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c7">Level 3</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Astral Caravan</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- An option to travel the planes starting at level 5. Unfortunately, most of your friends won&rsquo;t be able to follow you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Delayed Response</span><span>&nbsp;- This can be a very useful power, but it requires too much luck and a bit too much setup.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Gravitational Anchor</span><span>&nbsp;- Like </span><span class="c5">gravitational well</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;except that it penalizes attacks from your allies, allows a reflex save to negate the entire effect, and targets flying or levitating creatures.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c7">Level 4</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Expulsion</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- The more summoned demons, angels, elemental, etc., the more mileage you&rsquo;ll get out of this power. You unfortunately can&rsquo;t augment this power to boost the save DC. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Flight</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- You&rsquo;re taking this. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Wrench</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- If you&rsquo;re dealing with enemies that like to teleport or go ethereal (see: most extraplanar enemies or casters from level 7 and upward), you&rsquo;ll need this power. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c7">Level 5</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Baleful Teleport</span><span>&nbsp;- Not actually a teleportation of an opponent, but a damage effect. Like </span><span class="c5">disintegrate</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;in that it affect fortitude instead of the usual reflex. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Psychoport</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- You&rsquo;re taking this. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Psychoport Trigger</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- A get out of jail free card, but you probably shouldn&#39;t&rsquo; want to have to use this. Good for an NPC BBEG to escape with. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c7">Level 6</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Banish </span><span>- Strictly better than </span><span class="c5">expulsion</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;because you can boost the save DC of the power for when you&rsquo;re dealing with bigger threats. Use it to get rid of summoned or called creatures that don&rsquo;t contribute to loot at the end of a fight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Reposition</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Put everyone exactly where they need to be. This is a fantastic way to help out low maneuverability characters deal with high maneuverability ones, or get around tactical barriers like blocked hallways, transparent walls, etc. Eventually you can augment this to put enemies where they need to be, too. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c7">Level 7</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Dream Travel</span><span>&nbsp;- You already got a better travel power, that is also cheaper, in </span><span class="c5">psychoport</span><span class="c11">. There are better, and less complicated save-or-die effects than leaving an enemy in a dreamscape where you can&rsquo;t rob him of his stuff.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Ethereal Form</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Better for you that it would be for a spellcaster because you don&rsquo;t have material components to care about. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c7">Level 8</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Time Hop, Mass</span><span>&nbsp;- Unlike </span><span class="c5">time hop</span><span class="c11">, which can target enemies, this only targets willing creatures. Unless your party members are so impatient by level 15 that you can&rsquo;t just tell a GM &ldquo;we wait X hours,&rdquo; this is pretty useless. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c7">Level 9</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Psychoportation Circle</span><span>&nbsp;- A permanent teleportation solution that doesn&rsquo;t require you to manifest </span><span class="c5">psychoportation, greater</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;every time you need to go somewhere. Unless you have a permanent base(s), you should skip this. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Time Regression</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- High level combat is usually determined before you roll initiative. Unless your allies rolled very badly, and the enemies got a bunch of critical hits, this probably won&rsquo;t save you. The book keeping will also be a nightmare.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><a id="id.pamk7tam7z06"></a><p class="c17"><span class="c19 c10 c25">Seer (Clairsentience)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c7">Level 1</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Destiny Dissonance</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- The sickened effect is not worth an enemy being close enough that you can touch them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Precognition</span><span>&nbsp;- A +2 insight bonus that you can apply whenever you need it. The duration is nice, but it only lasts until you discharge it. A suped-up </span><span class="c5">guidance</span><span class="c11">. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Psychic Tracking</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Lets you fill the role of tracker/hunter for the party if you don&rsquo;t have a ranger that can do it. Helpfully lets you track Druids. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c7">Level 2</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Clairvoyant Sense</span><span>&nbsp;- Psionic </span><span class="c5">clairaudience/clairvoyance</span><span class="c11">. A fantastic way to scout dungeons, castles, or spy on &nbsp;others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">False Future</span><span>&nbsp;- Not as good as the Nomad&rsquo;s </span><span class="c5">dimensional swap </span><span class="c11">power, but still useful. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Object Reading</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- There is a lot you could learn with this power if you&rsquo;re doing any kind of investigation. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Sensitivity to Psychic Impressions</span><span>&nbsp;- </span><span class="c5">Object Reading</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;will give you more specifics than this power, but this can still be useful. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">True Terror</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Stun is a really nasty effect to apply, but the duration is terrible and it&rsquo;s only a single target power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c7">Level 3</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Escape Detection</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Even if you expect your GM to be constantly spying on the party, this won&rsquo;t be particularly useful because your allies will still be visible. A decent BBEG power, though. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Fate Link</span><span>&nbsp;- Similar to </span><span class="c5">share pain</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;except that you need two enemies to fail a will save and then they both will be injured at the same time. It&rsquo;s a will save, but it&rsquo;s not mind-affecting, so there are plenty of enemies that this can be affected by. The double save is rough, though.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c7">Level 4</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Anchored Navigation</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- For when a psychoportation goes horribly wrong. If you&rsquo;re really worried about that situation, grab a power stone. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c15">Remote Viewing</span><span>&nbsp;- Like </span><span class="c5">scry</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;except that you can interact with your surroundings. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c7">Level 5</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Clairtangent Hand</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Being able to manipulate objects without line of sight is a very powerful effect Trapped in room? Look into the control room and pull the lever that will free you. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Second Chance</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Your best way to gain rerolls on saving throws or ability checks, but it requires you to manifest it ahead of time. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c7">Level 6</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Precognition, Greater</span><span>&nbsp;- +4 to a bunch of rolls is pretty great, though you might be able to get more mileage out of </span><span class="c5">second chance</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;in combat. The long duration does make this more reliable though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c7">Level 7</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Fate of One</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- A power similar to the Seer capstone comes 7 levels early. You can&rsquo;t affect as many rolls, and you have to pay the power point cost regardless of the result of the second roll, but you don&rsquo;t have to expend your psionic focus. I&rsquo;d rather manifest Second Chance at the start of a combat. This can save you in a pinch, though. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c7">Level 8</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Hypercognition</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- I don&rsquo;t know why you wouldn&rsquo;t always manifest this as an immediate action, if only because it&rsquo;s cooler to immediately have all that knowledge at your fingertips.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c7">Level 9</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Metafaculty</span><span>&nbsp;- Not even a </span><span class="c5">wish</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;stops you from knowing the question that makes a supercomputer spit out 42. Be wary of the ability score burn, though.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><a id="id.swu609wul9wy"></a><p class="c17"><span class="c19 c10 c25">Shaper (Metacreativity)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c7">Level 1</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c15">Astral Construct</span><span>&nbsp;- </span><span>Astral constructs</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;are fantastic. This should be one of the core reasons that you&rsquo;re a shaper. Get this power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c15">Ectoplasmic Creation</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- As long as you have the appropriate craft skill, you can create *anything* organic (temporarily). Wizards and sorcerers can&rsquo;t do this until caster level 7. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c7">Level 2</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Reconstruction</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- A good way to heal your psicrystal or astral construct in a pinch. Probably better as a dorje.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c7">Level 3</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Concealing Amorpha, Greater </span><span class="c11">- Proper total concealment that isn&rsquo;t defeated by true seeing is great.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Ectoplasmic Cocoon</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Save-or-suck spells that target reflex saves are rare because most big strong dangerous enemies have bad reflex saves. Make the BBEG take a break and not contribute while you deal with his friends. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c36">Level 4</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Crystalline Bonds</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Another Save or suck reflex save power. This one lets you fight your enemy while they&rsquo;re tied up They can break out, but it takes them a full round to do so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Modify Matter </span><span>&nbsp;- Psionic </span><span class="c5">fabricate</span><span class="c11">, 1 spell level earlier than arcanists get it. A great utility power. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Quintessence</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- It&rsquo;s a poison/damaging substance that also acts as immortality gel. It&rsquo;s hard to get in large quantities unless you have a MASSIVE amount of time on your hands, though. Don&rsquo;t let your friends touch the stuff, though. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c7">Level 5</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Hail of Crystals</span><span>&nbsp;- Without any augmentation this power averages 35 damage to a single target if a touch attack hits and they don&rsquo;t pass their save. It&rsquo;s alright.</span><span class="c19 c27">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c19 c27"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c19 c27"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c7">Level 6</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Crystallize</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- The rare psionic save or die that isn&rsquo;t mind-affecting and doesn&rsquo;t target will. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Genesis</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- You create a demiplane. Until Ultimate Magic, psions were the only people capable of this. It&rsquo;s still great, though. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Modify Matter, Greater</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- If you took modify matter you won&rsquo;t need this. If you didn&rsquo;t, then go ahead and grab this one because it makes 10x more stuff. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c7">Level 7</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Ectoplasmic Cocoon, Mass</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- The first one is really good, and so is this one. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c7">Level 8</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Astral Seed</span><span>&nbsp;- A nice get out of jail free card for death. It&rsquo;s basically a lich&rsquo;s phylactery that doesn&rsquo;t automatically rebuild you. Grab the power to create it, and then retrain or use </span><span class="c5">psychic reformation</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;to learn something more generally useful. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c10 c7 c23">Level 9</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">True Creation</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- You gain the power to truly create *anything.* It is real, it cannot be dispelled. Crafting checks are for idiots. Just watch out for the ability burn. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><a id="id.x6q6z87d1ueg"></a><p class="c17"><span class="c19 c10 c25">Telepath (Telepathy)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c7">Level 1</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Empathic Connection</span><span>&nbsp;- Augmentation makes this power much better than </span><span class="c5">charm person</span><span class="c11">, if you can identify the creature you&rsquo;re targeting, or if you need a more long term mole. A very nice power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Mindlink</span><span>&nbsp;- This becomes a </span><span class="c6">good</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;power if you aren&rsquo;t getting the telepathy discipline level 8 telepathy ability. If you are, then you won&rsquo;t want it in the long run. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Suppress Compulsion</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- This can be helpful for when your rogue fails this will save, but having a rogue is probably something you want to avoid happening in the first place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c7">Level 2</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Aversion</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- The duration makes this a decent out of combat power, and the augmentation for it is pretty cost-efficient, but there are probably better ways to achieve that effect. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Brain Lock</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- It&rsquo;s &nbsp;a will save the target gets every round, the duration is tied to concentration, and you have to augment it for it to affect non-humanoids. Not a fan. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Compelling Voice</span><span>&nbsp;- This is basically the psionic version of the </span><span class="c5">suggestion</span><span>&nbsp;spell.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Read Thoughts</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- The area of effect on this power is very nice, basically letting you can an entire room for information. It&rsquo;s still only going to be helpful outside of combat, and even then it will have a slightly niche use.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Sense Minds</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- This is an extremely niche power that takes a very long time to activate. It is helpfully not blocked by walls or barriers, however. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c10 c7">Level 3 </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Battlesense</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- I can&rsquo;t count on two hands the number of times I&rsquo;ve seen people take advantage of aid another in combat, and the duration isn&rsquo;t very strong. The buffs you can get are nice because circumstance bonuses are relatively easy to stack. There are worse buff powers you could know, but there are better buff powers you could know.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Crisis of Breath</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- I&rsquo;m not a fan of single target save-or-die effects, especially not ones that you&rsquo;ll need to augment to affect non-humanoids. It requires two failed saves to be a true save-or-die, but if they fail the will save, the character will probably be useless for the remainder of an encounter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Empathic Transfer, Hostile</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- You&rsquo;d rather not be in range to apply a touch spell on an enemy, even with your ability to buff your personal defenses. If you&rsquo;ve taken the damage required to make this power worthwhile, you&rsquo;re probably going to be in very bad shape. The burst augmentation of the power is fun, though. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">False Sensory Input</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- It&rsquo;s a single target illusion that trades out being negated by true-seeing for being a mind-affecting power. While the former is something that is extremely problematic for illusions, the latter is a problem you already have with far too many of your abilities. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c10 c7">Level 4</span><span class="c13 c10">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Alienation</span><span>&nbsp;- This is </span><span class="c8">remotely interesting</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;in a campaign heavy on social situations, but completely overpriced for anything other than that. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Fear Cascade</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- A weird power. Cowering is an incredible status to put on an enemy, and even if you fail to apply it to the target, his friends are shaken for a round. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Memory Modification</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- A niche power that will let you do some good stuff when you actually use it. I&rsquo;m just not sure how often that&rsquo;s going to be. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Mind Control</span><span>&nbsp;- Hey look it&rsquo;s </span><span class="c5">dominate person</span><span>, but the duration isn&rsquo;t impacted by concentration, and you can receive sensory input from a target. Awesome.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Mindlink</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Thieving</span><span>&nbsp;- This power is </span><span class="c6">good</span><span>&nbsp;if you expect to see lots of psionic characters in </span><span>your</span><span>&nbsp;campaign. If you don&rsquo;t expect to see many, if any, psionic characters in the game, it&rsquo;s </span><span class="c2">terrible</span><span class="c11">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c15">Schism</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Go easy on your enemies with a lower manifester level in exchange for obliterating the action economy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Sensory Cascade</span><span>&nbsp;- Compare this power to </span><span class="c5">confusion</span><span>, a level 4 sorcerer/wizard spell. </span><span class="c5">Sensory cascade</span><span>&nbsp;completely blinds the target regardless of whether or not they have eyes, and has a 75% chance that the target does nothing every round. You don&rsquo;t get the occasional comedy of a confused character killing himself one of his allies, but you also can&rsquo;t make </span><span class="c5">confusion</span><span>&nbsp;permanent after augmentation</span><span class="c19 c27">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c7">Level 5</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Metac</span><span class="c14 c10">oncert</span><span>&nbsp;- If you don&rsquo;t expect to have many psionic characters with you or in the party, </span><span class="c2">skip this power</span><span class="c11">. If you do have other psionic characters in the party then this will take some prep work to take advantage of because of the 1 minute manifesting time. When you can make it work though, it&rsquo;s pretty incredible what you&rsquo;re able to do with it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Mind Probe</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- The best way to get information from an NPC that isn&rsquo;t immune to mind-affecting abilities. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c7">Level 6</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Mind Switch</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- A tempting, but incredibly dangerous power to use. If your target dies, you die too, and your original body probably won&rsquo;t be nearly as durable without psionic powers to protect it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c7">Level 7</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Crisis of Life</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- I&rsquo;m not a fan of save or die spells, and this one will age very badly unless you augment it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c10 c7">Level 8</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Mind Seed</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- This is a weird power. I really don&rsquo;t know why you&rsquo;d want to create a duplicate of yourself that you couldn&rsquo;t control. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c7">Level 9</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Mind Switch, True</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Does that dragon&rsquo;s body look interesting to you? I bet it does. It&rsquo;s yours now and forever, and now when you squish your old body under your new claws you won&rsquo;t be killing yourself. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Psychic</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c14 c10">Chirurgery</span><span>&nbsp;- This power is only </span><span class="c10">average</span><span>&nbsp;if you don&rsquo;t have another psionic character in the party, NPC or otherwise. Getting rid of all of those status effects is nice, but there are going to be more affordable ways to do that, and other classes that will be better at it. If you have another psionic character to give psionic powers to, or trade psionic powers with, it becomes </span><span class="c14 c10">great</span><span class="c11">.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c19 c10 c34">**Conduit (Athanatism)</span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c11">(Due to the conduit&#39;s Spirit Affinity ability, they have more flexibility in taking limited powers.)</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c22 c10 c24"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c7">Level 1</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Guidance of the Ancestors</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- This has some flexibility, but the individual effects are still situational. At low levels, this allows you to leverage your high intelligence into being the knowledgeable one. At higher levels, it&#39;s most useful for picking up another language when needed. However, its short duration limits its use.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Insight of</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">the Dead</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- This is a situational, but effective, power for information gathering. In investigative games, this is good, otherwise it&#39;s limited.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Seance</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- This can be amazingly powerful for its level. While its low save DC and potential for deception are problematic for use on enemies, when used on those who would cooperate, this can give essential information easily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c7">Level 2</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bond of</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">Death</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- This is extremely narrow. However, if you plan on turning your friends into undead, this is generally a powerful boost to their companion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Bring Forth the Soul</span><span>&nbsp;- This is generally less effective at obtaining information than </span><span class="c5">seance</span><span class="c11">, but it also functions as a powerful scouting power and eventually becomes a less-effective but free form of raise dead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Follow the Strands</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Useless. Perhaps it could allow you to find the owner of stolen property, but that&#39;s unlikely to come up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Object</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Possession</span><span>&nbsp;- While this should be an interesting polymorph effect, the power does not actually allow you to maintain your intelligence in object form. If it is ruled that you retain your mental abilities and manifesting, this is </span><span class="c6">good</span><span>. Otherwise, it is </span><span class="c2">terrible</span><span class="c11">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c7">Level 3</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Deathbond</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Yet another way to receive information from the dead. However, there are some powers that work well with this, allowing long-range resurrection. With the long duration, this could be worth picking up for a day before dropping again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Quicken</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span><span class="c14 c10">Rejuvenation</span><span>&nbsp;- Useless without allied ghosts or augmentation. If you plan to spend most of your time incorporeal, the augmented version of this is </span><span class="c20 c10">great</span><span>. With allied ghosts, this is </span><span class="c6">good</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;in most campaigns.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Resting with the Fallen</span><span>&nbsp;- Not much better than </span><span class="c5">insight of the dead</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;unless augmented.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c7">Level 4</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Binding of the Flesh</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- While low-level for a resurrection effect, the temporary duration and destruction of remains mean that you probably won&#39;t want to use this on your friends.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c15">Gift of the Corpse</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- If your friends are willing to stuff your body in a bag of holding, (with a hand hanging out so that you can return) this is an absurdly powerful defensive and mobility buff. It gives you incorporeality and all undead immunities as well as a fly speed. It lasts all day and you can&#39;t be killed while it&rsquo;s active. Most natural weapons cannot damage incorporeal targets at all, so this will provide complete immunity to many monsters.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Inverse Possession</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- A very situational power that provides a minor bonus. The second augment is good, but it still requires an available target.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Scales of </span><span class="c10 c15">Damnation</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- This is a reasonable pre-combat buff, but where it really shines is with the first augment. It allows for greatly reduced buffing costs with half-decent Charisma. When combined with any healing power, it provides a great deal of all-day endurance and an all-day buff.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c7">Level 5</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ephemeral Binding</span><span>&nbsp;- Pretty much strictly worse than the 3rd level power </span><span class="c5">fettering the shade</span><span class="c11">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Horrid Fetter</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span><span class="c11">- This is basically Planar Binding for incorporeal creatures. This can give you very powerful, long-lasting, minions. However, it is somewhat difficult to use.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Orphic Descent</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- This can call up very powerful allies, no matter how long ago they died. When augmented, this can give you great minions. However, it has a long manifesting time and potential for failure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c7">Level 6</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Autolingua</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- This allows you to completely short-circuit many investigation plots. While somewhat situational, the conduit&#39;s Spirit Affinity ability allows you to have it when you need it. The augments allow you to be faster or even to find that macguffin you need.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bind Flesh</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">to Soul</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- This is pretty much useless on enemies. However, if used with incorporeal allies, this is an amazing tool to share buffs. Manifest it on your entire party and then unload your daily buff on yourself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c15">Death Pact</span><span>&nbsp;- If the target agrees, this gives them auto-rez and what is a power-up for many characters. All the augments but the last are a little confusing for PCs, but could still be useful. Obviously, if they do not consent, it&#39;s </span><span class="c2">terrible</span><span class="c11">. The permanent duration combines well with Spirit Affinity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Ex Nihilo</span><span>&nbsp;- This is not really an improvement on </span><span class="c5">gift of the corpse</span><span class="c11">, especially with the shortened duration. There may be some times when you&#39;d want this instead, but not many. Even two levels later it&#39;s still nice though.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c7">Level 7</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Horrid Transformation</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- This is a horribly inefficient combination of hold person and a death effect that merely spawns another monster upon completion. On top of that, it requires augmentation to affect most targets at all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Sever the Strand</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- This is unlikely to ever come up. On top of that, the permanent duration allows it to be dispelled if your enemies really want to bring them back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Spiritual Contingency</span><span>&nbsp;- This is </span><span class="c5">trigger power</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;a level late, but with the ability to affect a dead body. It does allow you to have two triggered powers at the same time. In addition, Spirit Affinity means that it does not need to clog up a power known slot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c7">Level 8</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Gate of Avernus</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- While this power is costly, it can provide you with the assured service of very powerful creatures. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c15">Inurement</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Not only does this return you from the dead, it gives you a powerful template in the process, one which makes you effectively immortal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c7">Level 9</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Both Feet in the Grave</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- While the long manifesting time of this power make it useless in combat, if properly planned, this can be a significant upgrade to your character&#39;s abilities.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rending the Veil</span><span>&nbsp;- This is a rather situational power that is not too effective.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c10 c25">Psion/Wilder</span><a id="id.9oqjmgpoaf61"></a><span class="c19 c10 c25">&nbsp;Powers</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c19 c27">*Indicate powers that are both talents and first level powers, and can also be augmented.

In your case, you also have a better way to apply it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Conceal</span><span class="c10 c64">&nbsp;</span><span class="c14 c10">Thoughts</span><span>* - This power is either </span><span class="c6">good</span><span>&nbsp;or </span><span class="c14 c10">great</span><span>, depending on the campaign. It is essentially a flat +10 bonus to bluff that will stack with most spells, powers, and magic/psionic items that you can apply to your fellow party members. In a game where you&rsquo;ll be doing even moderate sleuthing or espionage, this power is an absolute </span><span class="c14 c10">must have</span><span>. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Create Sound</span><span>* - Like </span><span class="c5">ghost sound</span><span class="c11">, this power is going to have legs for a long time. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Crystal Light</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- This allows your psicrystal so serve as a torch, and also for you to use that psicrystal or any crystal to throw next to someone to dazzle another a creature. The best talent if you don&rsquo;t have darkvision.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Detect Psionics</span><span class="c11">* - You get this as a power known automatically, and that&rsquo;s awesome because it&rsquo;s an awesome power when you do spend points on it, and you don&rsquo;t have to do that. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Distract</span><span>* - If you need a way to overcome sense motive, </span><span class="c5">conceal thoughts</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;is a much better power. Unless you are a stealthy psion (aka a blue), or playing in a game where you&rsquo;ll need to sneak around, you should absolutely skip this power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Ectoplasmic Trinket</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- This is a pretty interesting power if you don&rsquo;t have to spend power points on it. It&rsquo;s not a bad way to manufacture some basic ammunition for the party, and can create a basic tool in a pinch. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Empathy</span><span class="c11">* - It&rsquo;s a nice power to put up before you enter a conversation, but you&rsquo;re the only one who can take advantage of the bonus to skills, and they&rsquo;re ones you won&rsquo;t be very good at. It&rsquo;s not a bad espionage power if you have a way to discreetly give the emotional information you&rsquo;re reading off the subject to your party</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Energy Splash</span><span>&nbsp;- Just take </span><span class="c5">energy ray</span><span>&nbsp;or </span><span class="c5">crystal shard</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Far Hand</span><span>* </span><span class="c11">- A good little utility power for when you need to pull a lever or push a button.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Float</span><span>* </span><span class="c11">- Unless you are in an aquatic campaign and also can&rsquo;t afford to put ranks in swim, you should skip this. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Fortify, Lesser</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Resistance bonuses to saves fade very quickly, and a +1 bonus isn&rsquo;t much to write home about, but at least it&rsquo;s a bonus you&rsquo;ll see some use out of.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Judge</span><span class="c11">* - If you want to make a single sense motive check with a +2 bonus, use empathy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Mis</span><span class="c6">sive</span><span>* - A </span><span class="c6">good</span><span>&nbsp;power when you don&rsquo;t have to spend points on it, but unless you think you&rsquo;ll be doing any espionage it&rsquo;s not really worth your time and drops down to </span><span class="c8">bad</span><span class="c11">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">My Light</span><span>* - Crystal light is a better and more versatile option for providing light than this. It&rsquo;s a shame because &nbsp;</span><span class="c5">my light</span><span>&nbsp;is </span><span class="c11">a pretty cool power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Psionic Repair</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- This would be much more useful if it affected your constructs. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Sense Poison</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- This is an option that the Druid or Cleric prepare after you think someone has been affected by a poison, not something you dedicate a powers known slot to.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Telekinetic Punch</span><span>&nbsp;- You can do some cheeky disarmament with this power, but you&rsquo;ll be better served in terms of utility by taking </span><span class="c5">far hand</span><span>&nbsp;instead</span><span class="c11">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Telepathic Lash</span><span>* - Dazed is almost as good of an effect to put on creatures as sleep, and this spell targets more HD than </span><span class="c5">slumber</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;will, but the duration of this power holds it back. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Unearthly Terror</span><span class="c11">* - A will save to apply the shaken effect is usually not going to be worth expending your psionic focus for. You get this power to augment it later.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Vim</span><span>&nbsp;- Just use </span><span class="c5">vigor</span><span class="c11">. 1 power point and maintaining psionic focus is worth the extra 4 temp HP.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><a id="id.wzjre7lbt6qt"></a><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c10 c7">Level 1 Powers</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Astral Traveler</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Only useful if you have a Nomad, or someone else who can manifest astral caravan</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Attraction</span><span>&nbsp;- It&rsquo;s psionic </span><span class="c5">charm person</span><span class="c11">. It&rsquo;s still good here as a way to limit or ignore the impact of a poor charisma.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Blinding Flash</span><span class="c11">* Blinded is a fantastic effect to apply on someone, but the duration simply isn&rsquo;t there without hefty power point expenditure. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Bolt</span><span>&nbsp;- If you&rsquo;re trying to play an archer psion, or have any ranged combatants in your party, this is a </span><span class="c6">good</span><span>&nbsp;power. Otherwise, it&rsquo;s </span><span class="c8">not worth much</span><span class="c11">. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Broker</span><span>&nbsp;- Skip this, and use </span><span class="c5">telempathic projection</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;for free.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Call to MInd</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- A +4 bonus and a reroll after a failed knowledge check is really nice, but failing a knowledge check doesn&rsquo;t usually have that dire of consequences for you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Catfall</span><span>&nbsp;- Psionic </span><span class="c5">featherfall</span><span>, but it works slightly differently. It will keep you safer than </span><span class="c5">featherfall</span><span>&nbsp;because it won&rsquo;t make you a floating target, but you&rsquo;ll need to expend power points on higher falls. Probably not worth expending a powers known slot on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Conceal Thoughts</span><span class="c11">* - There is no reason to spend a power point on this, the duration is long enough that you can easily manifest it long before you run into a situation where you wouldn&rsquo;t want to lose psionic focus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Control Flames</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- A very nice power for dealing damage and making enemies move around that ignores SR and PR. It&rsquo;s one of the very few powers you have that automatically scales with level, but it&rsquo;s held back by always being fire damage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Control Light</span><span>&nbsp;- A combination of the effects of the </span><span class="c5">darkness</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c5">daylight </span><span class="c11">spells. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Create Sound</span><span class="c11">* - Only expend points on this power if you intend to do a couple of combinations of powers quickly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Crystal Shard</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- One of your two direct damage dealing options among first level powers. Crystal shard ignores spell resistance/power resistance, which will help against certain enemies like golems, but is affected by damage resistance. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Deceleration</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- A rare reflex save debuff, but you&rsquo;re probably better off increasing your own party member&rsquo;s speed instead of trying to decrease your enemies. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Deja Vu</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- You need to be little clever, but when applied correctly this is a good save-or-suck power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Demoralize</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Allows a save for a mediocre debuff.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Detect Compulsion</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Who put the psionic talent in the 1st level power&rsquo;s list?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Detect Psionics</span><span class="c11">* - Identifying magic items can be a pain, getting a +10 bonus to the spellcraft check, and being able to maintain it without a concentration check makes it much easier.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Disable</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- A short range mind-affecting debuff with a hit dice limit that is totally negated by your opponents taking a standard action or receiving any healing. Trash. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dissipating Touch</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Why would you use then when you have two perfectly good ranged touch attack damage powers available to you, and a better melee touch attack damage power? Cool flavor, though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Ectoplasmic Sheen</span><span>&nbsp;- The psionic version of </span><span class="c5">grease</span><span>.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Empathy</span><span>* - You&rsquo;d probably be better off spending a point on </span><span class="c5">telempathic projection</span><span class="c11">, but this doesn&rsquo;t allow a save, and the augmentation improves the duration.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Empty Mind</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c11">- The best thing about this power is that it&rsquo;s an untyped bonus. Unfortunately it&rsquo;s a bonus to your good save, and it only lasts a single round. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Energy Ray</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Your other option for dealing damage. This one is affected by spell resistance/power resistance, but ignores DR. It also has the chance of either being negated by a creature&rsquo;s energy resistance, or taking advantage of a creature&rsquo;s vulnerability. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Entangling Debris</span><span>&nbsp;- The psionic version of </span><span class="c5">entangle</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;that requires you concentrate during the duration, but doesn&rsquo;t require a natural setting to work, and forces targets to move &frac12; their speed even on a successful saving throw, so it will always be useful. You can augment it to deal damage as well. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Entangling Ectoplasm</span><span>&nbsp;- This doesn&rsquo;t require you to concentrate like </span><span class="c5">entangling debris</span><span class="c11">, and doesn&rsquo;t allow a saving throw if you make the ranged touch attack. The augmentation is useless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">**</span><span class="c14 c10">Euterpe&rsquo;s Prophetic Song</span><span class="c20">&nbsp;</span><span>- While initially underwhelming, this scales to become one of the best buffs in the game. If you have </span><span class="c5">solicit psicrystal</span><span>, this is a must.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Far Hand</span><span class="c11">* - The augmentation you&rsquo;ll probably use most often is the one that increases the maximum weight of the target, and you&rsquo;ll probably still be expending psionic focus to decrease its cost.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">*</span><span class="c10">*</span><span class="c2">Find the Host</span><span>&nbsp;- This is completely useless. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Float</span><span class="c11">* - No.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Force Screen</span><span>&nbsp;- This starts out strong because you aren&rsquo;t proficient with shields and it doesn&rsquo;t take up free hand for weapon finesse users, but falls behind Inertial armor because it&rsquo;s augmentation is more expensive. It is a </span><span class="c6">good</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;option for gish characters, though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Fortify</span><span>&nbsp;- Augmentation helps to keep this power relevant, but the duration would keep it from replacing a </span><span class="c5">cloak of resistance</span><span>.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Foxhole</span><span>&nbsp;- </span><span class="c11 c50">Leave digging holes to Beefcake McMuscles the fighter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c50">**</span><span class="c8 c50">Guide the Willing</span><span class="c50">&nbsp;- This is pretty useless when unaugmented, but eventually becomes a deathtouch. It&rsquo;s a way to fit a high-level power in a low-level slot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Hammer</span><span>&nbsp;- This is better this </span><span class="c5">dissipating touch</span><span>, but it still sucks because it means you&rsquo;re in melee</span><span class="c11">. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Inertial Armor</span><span>&nbsp;- Augmentation makes this power more effective than </span><span class="c5">mage armor</span><span>, and keeps it as a relevant buff throughout the entire game. It will help to give you some of the best armor class in the entire party. +8 </span><span class="c5">b</span><span class="c5">racers of armor</span><span>&nbsp;cost 32,000 gp, +8 </span><span class="c5">inertial armor</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;costs 9 power points. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Inevitable Strike</span><span>&nbsp;- </span><span class="c5">True Strike</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;is a good spell, and this is a better power. It gives you more options, allowing you to take a small bonus this turn, or a larger bonus next turn. The more you make attack rolls, the more you&rsquo;ll want this power. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Judge</span><span class="c11">* - The value per point here is simply awful. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Know Direction and Location</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- This is useful at later levels when you&rsquo;ll be travelling and teleporting all over the planes. Grab a couple of power stones if you&rsquo;re really worried about that. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Locate Secret Doors</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Just take 20 on a perception check.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Matter Agitation</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- You make no attack roll, and your target gets no save, they just take damage. It takes a couple of rounds to get going, and won&rsquo;t be useful past low levels. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">**</span><span class="c2">Mark of the Shroud</span><span>&nbsp;- Useless unless you know psionic revivify, then pretty </span><span class="c6">good</span><span class="c11">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">**</span><span class="c2">Memories of Flesh</span><span>&nbsp;- Useless unless you or a friend is incorporeal, then a </span><span class="c6">decent buff</span><span class="c11">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Mind Thrust</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Best raw damage power, but it&rsquo;s mind-affecting and allows a saving throw.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Missive</span><span class="c11">* - You should avoid spending power points on this, unless you are very far away, and can&rsquo;t afford to lose your psionic focus </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">**</span><span class="c2">Morbid Fascination</span><span>&nbsp;- Horribly situational and weak on top of that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">My Light</span><span class="c11">* - This isn&rsquo;t worth spending power points on, and you shouldn&rsquo;t need to manifest this as a swift action.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Precognition, Defensive</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- This doesn&rsquo;t augment especially well, and the bonus is very modest, but the duration is nice. You have better powers that boost your armor class and saving throws. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Prescience, Offensive</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Bonuses to attack can be hard to come by, and this will stack with most things. Don&rsquo;t waste points on the swift action manifesting, use those to points to give yourself a larger bonus to attack before combat. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Sense Link</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Lets you see the rogue try to sneak off with treasure through his eye. Gives the party scout a second perception check.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">**</span><span class="c2">Shroudsight</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Undead are pretty common, and the augment isn&rsquo;t bad, but this is still horribly limited.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">**</span><span class="c6">Shunning of the Material</span><span>&nbsp;- This has a lot of creative uses, I like using it to bypass walls. When augmented, it can reshape a battlefield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Skate</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Use this to keep yourself out of harm&rsquo;s way, to let your friend get into harm&rsquo;s way more easily, or to make life easier on your pack mule when he&rsquo;s dragging all your equipment behind him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Slumber</span><span>&nbsp;- The psionic version of </span><span class="c5">sleep</span><span class="c11">, and you can augment it to affect more hit dice later, but not increase its save DC. Avoid this if you plan on playing past 4th level. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Synesthete</span><span>&nbsp;- Weird fluff, but it&rsquo;s a helpful way to defend yourself gaze attacks, or ignore</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;blindness/deafness, and it grants a bonus to your perception check. Not a bad power to get in a power stone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Telempathic Projection</span><span>&nbsp;- A decent social power for Psions who aren&rsquo;t telepaths. Telepaths should </span><span class="c2">skip</span><span>&nbsp;this power in favor of </span><span class="c5">empathic connection</span><span class="c11">. The bonus to skills isn&rsquo;t worth the power known compare to the alternative.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Telepathic Lash</span><span class="c11">* Augmentation too costly to be worth it. You&rsquo;ll probably want to expend a power point when manifesting this to keep your psionic focus, though. Just not a very good option.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Unearthly Terror</span><span>* This is a save or suck that actually will augment very well in the future, but if you&rsquo;re not going to augment it, you shouldn&rsquo;t be spending a power point on it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">**</span><span class="c2">Unnatural Aura</span><span>&nbsp;- While a powerful effect for a level 1 power, it&rsquo;s too limited to really see use. Only bother with it if you fight a bunch of druids or mounted enemies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Vigor</span><span>&nbsp;- One of the best personal buffs in Pathfinder. Providing temporary hit points before a fight is strictly better than healing the equivalent during a fight. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">**Ward the Mind</span><span class="c54">&nbsp;</span><span>- Way too situational.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><a id="id.in310kn5keav"></a><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c10 c7">Level 2 Powers</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bestow Power</span><span>&nbsp;- One of those powers that&rsquo;s </span><span class="c10">occasionally useful</span><span>&nbsp;if you have another psionic character in the party, but </span><span class="c2">useless </span><span class="c11">otherwise.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Biofeedback</span><span>&nbsp;- decent at early levels, but the augmentation is not points efficient. You&rsquo;ll never get more than DR 7/- out of it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">**</span><span class="c8">Blackest Shade</span><span>&nbsp;- a reasonably effective scout, but short-ranged. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Body Equilibrium</span><span>&nbsp;- Just use </span><span class="c5">defy gravity</span><span class="c11">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Breach</span><span>&nbsp;- Psionics&rsquo; </span><span class="c5">knock</span><span>. Grab a couple power stones if you think you&rsquo;ll need it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">**</span><span class="c2">Breath of Thanatos</span><span>&nbsp;- A penalty to saves if they fail a save? Pass.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Cleanse Body</span><span>&nbsp;- If your party needs someone to help out with the healing, this is a </span><span class="c6">good</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;option to take care of ability damage. Even if the party doesn&rsquo;t need help with that, it&rsquo;s still an average power. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Cloud Mind</span><span>&nbsp;- Psions don&#39;t&rsquo; get </span><span class="c5">invisibility</span><span>. Instead they get a single target, mind-affecting power that is more effective than invisibility when it works. &nbsp;Single target encounters that aren&rsquo;t immune to mind-affecting powers with low will saves that you can defeat without threatening them are pretty rare.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">**</span><span class="c2">Clutching the Shroud</span><span>&nbsp;- Don&rsquo;t bother unless you&rsquo;re dealing with a lot of negative energy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Concealing Amorpha</span><span>&nbsp;- Psionic </span><span class="c5">blur</span><span>. Helpfully not negated by true-seeing. Share Pain+Vigor will probably get your more mileage, but this is still a </span><span class="c6">good</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;pick for gish psions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Concussion Blast</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Force damage is nice because it&rsquo;s magical and almost nothing is immune to it. You don&rsquo;t get the best damage-pp ratio, though. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c15">Control Sound</span><span>&nbsp;- You create sounds by changing sounds that are already being created. The description lays out only some of the utility with this power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">**</span><span class="c2">Dead Hand</span><span>&nbsp;- This doesn&rsquo;t come with a way to see ethereal things, so the only use I see in it is stealing things with Shunning of the Material.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Defy Gravity</span><span>&nbsp;- Float around. Helpful if you want to avoid enemies in melee because it gets around the usual restriction on movement after a 5-ft. step. The power </span><span>is</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c14 c10">grea</span><span class="c14 c10">t</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;if you&rsquo;re a Nomad because you can use it to move your teammates into places they wouldn&rsquo;t normally be able to reach.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Detect Hostile Intent</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- You like going first, so being surprised sucks. A good power to have on hand out of combat as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Ego Whip</span><span>&nbsp;- If other character</span><span>s</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;did Charisma damage, this would be blue. As it is, you&rsquo;re still targeting a traditional dump stat, and getting dazed on a failed save.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Elfsight </span><span class="c11">- Coincidentally, most of the good races for being a psion already have darkvision or low-light vision.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Empathic Condition Relief </span><span>- Another power, like </span><span class="c5">cleanse body</span><span>, that can let you help with party healing or condition removal if necessary. Unfortunately it will often not remove the condition and instead simply decrease the duration.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Energy Adaptation, Specified</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- The rare psion power that automatically scales with level, and with a 4 point augment to let you manifest it the moment you need it. The sticking point is that it requires you to use your active energy type, so you can&rsquo;t get resistance to acid, and often the energy you&rsquo;re using for damage won&rsquo;t be the one you&rsquo;ll want to protect yourself from.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Energy Push</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- The size category limit holds this power back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Energy Stun</span><span>&nbsp;- Compared to </span><span class="c5">energy ray</span><span class="c11">, you&rsquo;re paying 2 points and up to 2d6 damage for a chance to stun a target. Not bad. Not great, but not bad. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>**</span><span class="c10">Epidermal Fissure</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- This is just weird, it&rsquo;s a reasonably effective buff and a weak debuff at the same time. Can give a very large Strength boost if augmented. Unlike Animal Affinity, this power works on your teammates, gives a skill boost, and can be augmented. However, it only works on one stat, has a shorter duration and deals them damage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Everyman</span><span>&nbsp;- Strictly better than </span><span class="c5">disguise self</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;with its ridiculous duration, but still not great for a character with low charisma.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Feat </span><span class="c10">Leach</span><span>&nbsp;- </span><span class="c2">Useless</span><span>&nbsp;in a campaign without another psionic character. Otherwise, it&rsquo;s going to be an </span><span class="c10">average</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Id Insinuation</span><span>&nbsp;- It&rsquo;s a </span><span class="c5">confusion </span><span>effect, &nbsp;but it only gives the target a 10% chance to act normally. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Inflict Pain</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Not a great debuff for both the duration and the effect. You&rsquo;re guaranteed to get something out of it, though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">**</span><span class="c37 c10">Heartbinding</span><span>&nbsp;- While the duration is nice, the bonuses are of common types. The augment is too expensive for what it is. If a party member has a good source of morale bonuses, this is </span><span class="c6">good</span><span class="c11">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">**</span><span class="c37 c10">Lifeless Tongues</span><span>&nbsp;- Not really worth the slot known.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>**</span><span class="c10">Melpomene&rsquo;s Psionic Howl</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- This is hard to resist, but also hard to position. Still, it&rsquo;s area damage with a rider effect in a low-level power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Mental Disruption</span><span>&nbsp;- Why use this when you can use </span><span class="c5">energy stun</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;and get a superior debuff, deal damage, and not let enemies within 10 ft of you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Metamorphosis, Minor</span><span>&nbsp;- If you&rsquo;re playing a Gish character, this is a </span><span class="c10 c15">must have</span><span class="c11">, but you should be an egoist and have gotten it at level 1. Normal psions will like to have it, especially if they have a way to share buffs with their friends.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Missive, Mass</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- More words, more targets and a longer range than the level 1 version.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Psionic Lock</span><span>&nbsp;- </span><span class="c5">Arcane lock</span><span class="c11">, but for psions. You don&rsquo;t have a book you need to protect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Psychic Bodyguard</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- How about you just buff your friend&rsquo;s will save, instead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Recall Agony</span><span>&nbsp;- Use </span><span class="c5">mind thrust</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;instead and deal 3d10 damage with a higher saving throw. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Sense Link, Forced</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- There are probably some uses for this, but I wouldn&rsquo;t devote a powers known slot to it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">**</span><span class="c2">Shape</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;the </span><span class="c14 c10">Shade</span><span class="c14">&nbsp;</span><span>- Useless unless heavily augmented. When augmented, this becomes a very flexible all-day buff. It can grant flight, pounce + reach, extra limbs, concealment, tremorsense or even more if augmented farther. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Share Pain</span><span>&nbsp;- A really </span><span class="c14 c10">great</span><span>&nbsp;defensive buff because you have vigor to give yourself a damage buffer. It&rsquo;s </span><span class="c10 c15">fantastic</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;if you a have a psicrystal to stay hidden and absorb damage for you with it hardness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Sustenance</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- This is a one point racial ability. It is not worth spending 3 points on unless you expect to be stranded in the wilderness and can&rsquo;t afford to put ranks in survival.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Swarm of Crystals</span><span>&nbsp;- Psionic </span><span class="c5">flaming hands</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;that will be blocked by DR instead of fire resistance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>**</span><span class="c8">Sympathetic Drain</span><span class="c37">&nbsp;</span><span class="c11">- Without the surge augment, this is pretty bad. All that saves it from being useless is its low cost and no-save damage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">**</span><span class="c2">Tormenting the Living</span><span class="c54">&nbsp;</span><span>- Way too minor an effect for the long duration to matter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Thought Shield</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- You have a good will save, and this is only going to help for one saving throw. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><a id="id.e6k698fgvv08"></a><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c13 c10 c7">Level 3 Powers</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c20 c10">**</span><span class="c14 c10">Banshee&rsquo;s Hearing</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span><span>- While not as effective as </span><span class="c5">touchsight</span><span class="c11">, this has a much longer duration.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">**</span><span class="c2">Biokinetic Endurance</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span><span class="c11">- Too situational to see use.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Body Adjustment</span><span>&nbsp;- Cure 1d12 hit points? </span><span class="c5">Cure Light Wounds</span><span>&nbsp;takes care of 1d8+5 hp at this level.</span><span>&nbsp;Walk into a fight with 25 temp HP from </span><span class="c5">vigor</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;for the same cost, and don&rsquo;t get injured in the first place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Body Purification</span><span>&nbsp;- Cleanse body costs 2 pp less, cures an average of .5 points more ability damage, and removes the fatigued condition. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">**Caustic Retribution</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- A weird buff that can deal a good bit of damage. Without a save augment, this falls off in utility.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">**</span><span class="c2">Caustic Transfusion</span><span>&nbsp;- Very weak when unaugmented, concentration duration is still a problem when augmented. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Concussive Onslaught </span><span class="c11">- 3d6 damage isn&rsquo;t very impressive. 3d6 force damage is moderately impressive because almost nothing resists it. 3d6 damage a round in a 30 ft. radius that you can augment to move around? That&rsquo;s pretty good. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Danger Sense</span><span>&nbsp;- This become a </span><span class="c10">decent power</span><span>&nbsp;if you are playing trapfinder for the party, if only because of it&rsquo;s generous duration. Otherwise you should </span><span class="c2">skip it</span><span class="c11">. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Dismiss Ectoplasm</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Practically requires you to be dealing with psionicists, and then only dealing with ones that manipulate ectoplasm frequently, to be of any use. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Dispel Psionics</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Someone in the party needs to have this. It may as well be the full manifester in the group. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Endorphin Surge</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Rage is a mediocre buff that strips you of the ability to manifest powers. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Energy Bolt</span><span>&nbsp;- You&rsquo;ll get more mileage out of </span><span class="c5">energy missile</span><span class="c11">, but it won&rsquo;t cost you a feat to get this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Energy Burst</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- You should expect to have an ally be within 40-ft. of you, or you&rsquo;ve let enemies get way too &nbsp;close to you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Energy Wall</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- You can&rsquo;t augment the power to increase the damage, though it does slightly scale with manifester level. It&rsquo;s a decent battlefield control spell, but it will lose power over time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Eradicate Invisibility</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- A power you&rsquo;d rather not use, and it comes 2 levels after invisibility enters the game, but you&rsquo;ll probably need someone in the party with this power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">**</span><span class="c6">Feast of the Dead</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span><span class="c11">- A power that provides a nice set of minor buffs and healing. Definitely worth manifesting if you have the time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">**</span><span class="c14 c10">Fettering The Shade</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- While the basic use of this is not too strong, the augments are very nice, especially with the long duration. I recommend Bane as an enhancement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>**</span><span class="c2">Follow the Strands</span><span>&nbsp;- Useless. Perhaps it could allow you to find the owner of stolen property, but that&#39;s unlikely to come up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">**</span><span class="c8">Fracture Pattern</span><span>&nbsp;- A bit too weak and easily resisted to really deserve a slot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Heightened Vision</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- You get darkvision. You get a better vision power this level.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">**</span><span class="c8">Living Haunter</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- A flexible power, but the effects are all weak. One of the only ways to create illusions psionically.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Mental Barrier</span><span>&nbsp;- This is really </span><span class="c2">bad</span><span>&nbsp;when you first get it, but it can become </span><span class="c10">decent</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;with some augmentation to increase the duration.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">**</span><span class="c2">Mind over the Immaterial</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span><span>- This would be great if you could target corporeal creatures with it. You can&rsquo;t, so it&rsquo;s bad.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Mind Trap</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Your enemy loses an additional 1d6 power points or nauseated and you still get mind controlled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Mindhunter</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- This is a weird power, but can actually be very helpful for tracking someone down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">**Moan of the Sorrowful Dead </span><span class="c11">- An effective save-or-lose that still imposes a small penalty on a passed save. However, as a fear effect, immunities are common. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">**</span><span class="c2">Myra&#39;s Occultation</span><span class="c54">&nbsp;</span><span class="c11">- A power for NPCs. Pass.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">**</span><span class="c6">Phantasmagoria</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span><span>- This covers a large and easily placed area with a save-or-lose. It forces multiple levels of saves and lasts a long time. It is still mind-affecting and lacks a DC augment though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Psionic Blast </span><span>- A 30-ft. cone-shaped burst of stun is pretty solid, but the duration is very poor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">**</span><span class="c10 c37">Release Death&rsquo;s Hold</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span><span class="c11">- An interesting effect, but not that useful. It will remove undead immunities if that&rsquo;s something you need, but it probably won&rsquo;t come up too much unless you have undead allies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">**Sanguine Displacement</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Starts out weak, scales to be an effective source of damage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">**</span><span class="c2">Shade Venom</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span><span>- Poison tends to not be a good option for PCs, and Psions have no abilities that make it better. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Share Pain, Forced</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- This has uses, but it&rsquo;s probably better to just directly deal damage to an enemy with your good blasing powers than get injured every time your enemy is hurt.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Sharpened Edge</span><span>&nbsp;- </span><span class="c5">keen</span><span>&nbsp;is a good </span><span>effect</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;to add onto a weapon for a gish character, or for anyone that has a crit-fisher in the party.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Solicit Psi</span><span class="c2">crystal</span><span>&nbsp;- If you have a psicrystal, you should have psicrystal containment, but this stacks with that, and reserves the psicrystal focus for expending for met</span><span>a</span><span>psionics or discipline abilities. A bit pricey when you first get it. If you don&rsquo;t have a psicrystal, this is obviously</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;useless</span><span>.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">**</span><span class="c14 c10">Spiritual Resting Place</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span><span>- This is a very effective method to safely rest. It is much like </span><span class="c5">rope trick</span><span>&nbsp;except that it can be used in combat and with less debate about how it works. The final augment makes it somewhat effective offensively as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Telekinetic Force</span><span>&nbsp;- Being able to move and push things around from a distance sounds less impressive than it is. Throw enemies off of cliffs, drop a chandelier on the guy in a ghost costume, throw the big stupid fighter into the thieving rogue like a bowling </span><span>ball</span><span class="c11">, create a rainstorm of giant weapons to damage your enemies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Time Hop</span><span>&nbsp;- There are so many wonderfully horrible and creative things you can do with time hop. The power doesn&rsquo;t force you to target a person, so it can be an effective way to move barriers out of your way or disarm a soldier in addition to making the BBEG disappear for a little bit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">**</span><span class="c2">Tormenting the Dead</span><span>&nbsp;- Not only is this a awfully situational, single-target blast, since it lacks the [object] tag, undead are completely immune to its effects. This means that it has nearly no valid targets.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Touchsight</span><span>&nbsp;- </span><span class="c5">See invisibility</span><span>, </span><span class="c5">darkvision</span><span>, and See in Darkness(Su) wrapped up into one power that also helps to protect you from visual illusions and gaze attacks. A </span><span class="c10 c15">fantastic</span><span>&nbsp;power for a party </span><span>scout</span><span>. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Ubiquitous Vision</span><span>&nbsp;- +4 to perception is nice, but not for 5 power points.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">**</span><span class="c2">Volatile Reaction</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span><span>- You will never want to use this, and if you did </span><span class="c5">protection from evil</span><span>&nbsp;is better.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><a id="id.67cevoxzw4u3"></a><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c10 c7">Level </span><span class="c13 c10 c7">4 Powers</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Augured Answer</span><span class="c14">&nbsp;</span><span class="c11">- Get the answer to any question you ask.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Aura Sight</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Detect Good/Evil and Detect Chaos/Law can be situationally useful, as first level spells that a cleric can prepare when he needs them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Correspond</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- The manifesting time is long, and the duration is incredibly short for the type of effect. The range is infinite, but sending messages is a standard action instead of a free action like most communication. When you expect to do a lot of extraplanar travel, this may be useful as a dorje or power stone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Deadly Fear</span><span>&nbsp;- </span><span class="c5">Phantasmal killer</span><span>&nbsp;is pretty crappy, but at least </span><span class="c5">phantasmal killer</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;can&rsquo;t be turned back on you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Death Urge</span><span>&nbsp;- A better save-or-die effect than </span><span class="c5">deadly fear</span><span class="c11">. It&rsquo;s still a save-or-die, and I&rsquo;m not a huge fan of those, but they have their place, and you could choose worse ones.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Detect Remote Viewing</span><span class="c56">&nbsp;</span><span>- The more scry and fry you expect to deal with, the better this power gets. However, this is only an alarm, it doesn&rsquo;t do anything to actually stop the </span><span class="c5">scry</span><span>&nbsp;or </span><span class="c5">remote viewing</span><span>&nbsp;attempt. Probably better for npcs than player characters.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Empathic Feedback</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- If enemies attack you, they are killing themselves, and it ignores any DR or energy resistance they might have. Better used as a power you put on your tanky character or on a gish than something a manifester relies on as a defensive buff.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Energy Adaptation</span><span>&nbsp;- An awesome personal defense buff. It automatically scales with manifester level and by the time you get this power, it is already granting you 20 energy resistance against </span><span class="c10">every energy type</span><span>&nbsp;except force in a single manifestation. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Fold Space</span><span>&nbsp;- Psionic </span><span class="c5">dimension door</span><span class="c11">, letting you bypass and solve so many problems in and out of combat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Incite Passion</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- A debuff that has some uses outside of combat, but that is limited by the duration. It&rsquo;s pretty weak inside of combat. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Intellect Fortress</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Really great if you expect to deal with a lot of blasting effects and spellcasters. The augmentation to deal with breath weapon damage is gravy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Mindwipe</span><span>&nbsp;- Negative levels are pretty strong, and the duration is good. Not as strong as </span><span class="c5">enervation</span><span class="c11">, though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Moment of Terror</span><span>&nbsp;- The [evil] rider is annoying, as is the size category limit. The prone and helpless duration is frankly pathetic. If you want a -2 penalty on will saves vs mind-affecting powers, just manifest </span><span class="c5">mindwipe</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;and force a -2 to everything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Personality Parasite</span><span>&nbsp;- Your force an unhelpful version of </span><span class="c5">schism</span><span>&nbsp;onto an opponent. Unless you&rsquo;re dealing with other psions, this </span><span class="c2">won&rsquo;t be of any use</span><span>. If you are dealing with other psions, this will only </span><span class="c8">occasionally be useful</span><span class="c11">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Power Leech</span><span>&nbsp;- I&rsquo;d rather manifest </span><span class="c5">personality parasite</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;than this, especially considering it requires concentration. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c15">&lt;&lt;</span><span class="c10 c15">Psychic Reformation</span><span class="c10 c15">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="c35">&nbsp;- The most important power known for a psion from level 7 to level 20. Period. Spend a day recuperat</span><span class="c35">i</span><span class="c35">ng after you </span><span class="c10 c15 c35">completely change your powers known, skills and feats</span><span class="c35">. This doesn&rsquo;t just let you retrain powers like a sorcerer, it lets you, given enough prep time, play like a suped-up cleric. When fully augmented, the enforced downtime vanishes, allowing you to spend 10 minutes</span><span class="c35">&nbsp;and 13 PP</span><span class="c19 c27">&nbsp;to completely rebuild your character multiple times a day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Psychokinetic Charge</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Fling an ally around the battlefield, and grant them a free attack.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Slip the Bonds</span><span>&nbsp;- </span><span class="c5">Freedom of movement</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;is a very good spell because being grappled and slowed down sucks for you. This is no different.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Telekinetic Maneuver</span><span>&nbsp;- CMD scales very much against the players in Pathfinder, and you won&rsquo;t be taking the feats to help you overcome them. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Trace Psychoport</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c11">- Useful for when you&rsquo;re chasing the BBEG through the planes and across time and space. Most parties won&rsquo;t need this until higher levels.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Wall of Ectoplasm</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Let&rsquo;s you engage in the standard divide and conquer strategy during combat, and the ability to create a flat plane and a sphere gives you some more out of combat utility. Automatically scales with level.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Wither</span><span>&nbsp;- Touch range powers generally suck, but 2d4 strength damage that&rsquo;s only halved on saving throw is no joke. This is probably best used if you have a psicr</span><span>y</span><span class="c11">stal or some other way to channel the power onto an enemy when they aren&rsquo;t right next to you. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><a id="id.nfu5gkpgidhx"></a><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c7 c13">Level 5 Powers</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Adapt Body</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Helps you deal with minor environmental hazards in the elemental planes, as well as let you move freely underwater and in the void of space.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Catapsi</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Situationally useful even if you can expect to run into psionic characters constantly. The emanation isn&rsquo;t very far reaching, just far enough to interfere with any allied psionic characters.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dream Message</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- This seems like a really good power to create an adventure hook, and a really terrible power for adventuring.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c15">Ectoplasmic Creation, Major</span><span>&nbsp;- The psionic equivalent of </span><span class="c5">major creation</span><span class="c11">. With a little creativity, this power will go a long, long way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Ectoplasmic Shambler</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- spellcasters within this shapeable mist can&rsquo;t see, take damage, and have to make concentration checks to cast or manifest. A great power for dealing with ranged threats.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Incarnate</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Let&rsquo;s you make lots of vision improvements and detections spells permanent. A good power to use every so often. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Induce Nightmare</span><span>&nbsp;- It&rsquo;d probably be more effective to manifest </span><span class="c5">remote viewing</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;and then manifest a psychokinesis power to deal damage than to deal 1d10 damage so that they, go forbid, can&rsquo;t sleep.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Leach Field</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- This is more useful than previously because it affects spells now, but you still won&rsquo;t be gaining a ton of points when you&rsquo;re hit by a spell. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Pierce the Veils</span><span>&nbsp;- Just like wizards and sorcerers, you get the ability to negate all illusions at level 5. It&rsquo;s dumb that a spell like </span><span class="c5">true seeing</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;exists, but here it is for you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c15">Planar Travel</span><span>&nbsp;- Equivalent to </span><span class="c5">plane shift</span><span class="c11">, with the bonus that you can augment the power to be more accurate when you need. Thus begins your exploration of the planes. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Power Resistance</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- A free scaling buff against spells and powers. It&rsquo;s going to cap out at a respectable 32. SR/PR is better on casters, but more so on those who can heal and buff themselves.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Psychic Crush</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- A mind-affecting save-or-dying. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Shatter Mind Blank</span><span>&nbsp;- </span><span class="c5">Mind blank</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c5">barred mind</span><span>&nbsp;are really annoying effects for any telepath or seer looking to manipulate or find someone. That&rsquo;s why you have </span><span class="c5">dispel psionics</span><span class="c11">. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Shrapnel Burst</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- I don&rsquo;t like blasting powers that are practically guaranteed to hurt your allies or mean that your character has completely isolated himself from his support. There&rsquo;s a better physical damage spell at this level, regardless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Tower of Iron Will</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- At level 9, this is going to be a 50/50 defense against mind-affecting spells and powers if you&rsquo;re dealing with an equal level caster who doesn&rsquo;t have any abilities like spell penetration. That would be terrible, but an immediate action casting time and great augmentation makes the power one that will be situationally useful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Upheaval</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- You rip up the ground, slam it down on your enemies and then make the ground under them difficult terrain. This would be blue if you could augment the damage in addition to the area of effect. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c19 c27"></span></p><a id="id.fmldxot6xnk5"></a><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c10 c7">Level 6 Powers</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Aura Alteration</span><span>&nbsp;- Getting a second saving throw against a charm or compulsion at a +2 bonus is really weak for a 6th level power considering that&rsquo;s the same effect </span><span class="c5">protection from evil</span><span>&nbsp;gets. Being able to alter alignment by one step is really weak for a 6th level power considering that&rsquo;s a lesser effect than what </span><span class="c5">misdirection</span><span>&nbsp;would allow you to do. Getting both doesn&rsquo;t make the power any better.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Breath of the Black Dragon</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Acid damage is actually hard to come by as a psion, but there are better blasting powers available to you regardless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Brutalize Wounds</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- This is a really good debuff. The will save is partial, with the duration being guaranteed. The target must either take a move action to get an extra save to avoid taking more damage, or they eat a ton of damage every time someone hits them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Co-opt Concentration</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- A power for a situation that isn&rsquo;t going to come up all that often.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Defer Fatality</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Definitely one of the better get out of death powers. You&rsquo;d rather never use these powers, though. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Disintegration</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Hit a touch attack, and then have them make a save or take massive damage. Just throw out a save or die if you want them to die, or use a standard blast power for more consistent damage. 22d6 at level 11 is really nice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Fuse Flesh</span><span>&nbsp;- An actual save or die compared to </span><span class="c5">disintegration</span><span class="c11">. Requires a melee touch attack, though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Remove View Trap</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Make someone take piddly damage in the very rare situation you are actually scryed on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Retrieve</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- A little pricey for the effect at this level, but there is a surprising number of things you can do with it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Suspend Life</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- An interesting adventure hook or plot twist, a useless power for an adventurer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Sustained Flight</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- If you can&rsquo;t fly already, either through equipment or powers, you need to grab this one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c15">Temporal Acceleration</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Grant yourself a free round of actions. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10">Trigger Power</span><span>&nbsp;- Like </span><span class="c5">contingency</span><span>, this power lets you act outside your action economy, either to save yourself or attack your enemies.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><a id="id.o379ojgq7ttj"></a><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c10 c7">Level 7 Powers</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Barred Mind, Personal</span><span>&nbsp;- Psionic </span><span class="c5">mind blank</span><span class="c11">, and like the spell it grants a resistance bonus that won&rsquo;t stack with anything. You at least get it two levels earlier, but it only has the range of personal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c15">Bend Reality</span><span>&nbsp;- It&rsquo;s psionic </span><span class="c5">limited wish</span><span class="c11">. The gold cost will keep you from throwing it around all the time, but, especially as a character with a powers known limit, you&rsquo;ll want it for the versatility.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Cosmic Awareness</span><span>&nbsp;- </span><span class="c5">Moment of prescience</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;on level earlier. A decent power to throw on before a fight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Decerebrate</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- A fortitude save or die. Not mind-affecting. It&rsquo;s solid. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Divert Teleport</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- At this level, almost every enemy will want to teleport. Keep dangerous enemies from teleporting into you, fleeing enemies from teleporting away from you, or use it as a threat to prevent any kind of teleportation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Energy Conversion</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Ignore damage and then fire it back on your attackers. It&rsquo;s fun, but maybe not that effective. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Energy Wave</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- You should have gotten whatever damage powers you&rsquo;re going to need by this point. If you haven&rsquo;t, a 120 ft. cone is good range/area of effect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ensconce</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Useful if you&rsquo;ve kidnapped someone and need to hide them, I guess.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Ethereal Passage</span><span>&nbsp;- It&rsquo;s </span><span class="c5">passwall</span><span>, but two levels later and only you can use it. Use </span><span class="c5">fold space</span><span>. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Evade Burst</span><span>&nbsp;- A decent buff if you don&rsquo;t want to get a </span><span class="c5">ring of evasion</span><span class="c11">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Oak Body</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- A good replacement for an amulet of natural armor, if you take time to manifest it before a fight. The speed penalty shouldn&rsquo;t be an issue due to flight. You&rsquo;ll get plenty of immunities out of it, too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Psychosis</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- There are better debuffs available to you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ultrablast</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- A staggeringly disappointing power for something called an &ldquo;ultra&rdquo; blast.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><a id="id.wvew3j6vab9q"></a><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c10 c7">Level 8 Powers</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Barred Mind</span><span>&nbsp;- Proper </span><span class="c5">mind blank</span><span class="c11">. At this level, it&rsquo;s only protecting you from divination and providing a +3 bonus vs. mind-affecting powers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Body of Iron</span><span>&nbsp;- Oak Body already gives you enough benefits in terms of immunities. This is probably a </span><span class="c6">better</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;pick for a melee gish, though. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Matter manipulation</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Useful if you have a golem or some other construct who relies on hardness in the party, I guess.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c15">Psychoport, Greater</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- You will be using this constantly. Plane shift and Psychoport to get where ever you need to be, whenever you need to be there. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Recall Death</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Mind-affecting save-or-die. Meh.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Shadow Body</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span><span>- For most manifesters, this will be </span><span class="c6">better</span><span>&nbsp;than </span><span class="c5">body of iron</span><span>&nbsp;or </span><span class="c5">oak body</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;because it lets you hide and gives you more non-AC defenses. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c15">True Metabolism</span><span>&nbsp;- 10 hp/round for 1 minute per level is amazing. This caps out at </span><span class="c10">2000</span><span>&nbsp;hit points restored with a single manifesting.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c11"></span></p><a id="id.ecds6uobrpf5"></a><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c10 c7">Level 9 Powers</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Affinity Field</span><span>&nbsp;- I&rsquo;d like this a lot more if you could specify allies, instead of it applying to all creatures.. You&rsquo;re going to need to be careful with the placement of the aura. That said, being able to turn every personal range power like </span><span class="c5">vigor</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;into a buff on the whole party is very useful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Apopsi</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- I don&rsquo;t know why you would ever use this. If a spell caster has a bad will save and also a couple of powers or spells that are going to obliterate the party, just use a save-or-die and instantly solve the problem.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c15">Assimilate</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- Get a +4 untyped bonus to all ability scores for killing what will effectively be a mook at this level. That alone makes this a great spell. All the other stuff is just gravy. Gishes should love this power for the temp HP alone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Ethereal Form, Greater</span><span>&nbsp;- </span><span class="c5">Ethereal jaunt</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;has its uses. You&rsquo;ll need it occasionally. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Microcosm</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;- No save-just die&hellip; if the target has less than 100 hit points and isn&rsquo;t immune to mind-affecting powers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c15">Reality Revision</span><span>&nbsp;- It&rsquo;s </span><span class="c5">wish</span><span>. Everyone grabs </span><span class="c5">wish</span><span class="c11">.
