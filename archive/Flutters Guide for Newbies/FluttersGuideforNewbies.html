If you&rsquo;re new, I cannot overstress the importance of arriving early. Everyone, especially the DM, is going to be extremely busy once the game starts and if you have any questions before the game is the place to do it. For your first session you want at least 15 extra minutes to find the place and half an hour to check in and introduce yourself. </span></li><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">7:15 -- Geek sudoku!</span><span class="c3">&nbsp; People finalize how many people they have for which table. The veterans will then decide who&#39;s playing what character, trying to balance out levels, tiers, and party composition. The DM desperately tries to sneak in one more reading of the scenario.</span></li><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">7:30 -- The Scenario Begins.</span><span>&nbsp; People get going. There&#39;s a mission briefing to which </span><span>savvy players pay attention</span><span>&nbsp;and take notes. &nbsp;Try to be one of those players. &nbsp;Mission briefings will often have crucial clues that will help you later on. &nbsp;(Other players during this time may be finding dice and minis, or checking character sheets, phones, and chronicle sheets to make last minute purchases.) &nbsp;</span><span class="c3">You will get a flurry of five or six mispronounced names without much clear idea whether Drendle Drang is a person you&#39;re talking to, a place you want to go, or a particularly nasty curse you want to avoid. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t worry! &nbsp;You&#39;ll have a chance to ask questions, gather information and make knowledge checks to get some idea of what you&#39;re in for.</span></li><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">7:40 onwards -- The Main Action. &nbsp;</span><span class="c3">There will be ~ 4 encounters, usually some mooks for one fight, a trap or three, some sort of a skill or social challenge, some sort of strong monster that&rsquo;s usually more likely to kill you than the boss, and then a solo or near solo boss fight. These will inevitably involve some back and forth between the GM and the players. &ldquo;I&#39;m over here; he&#39;s over there!&rdquo; &nbsp;&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; &nbsp;&ldquo;How are you searching?&rdquo; &nbsp;&ldquo;How does that rule work?&rdquo; &nbsp;The questions and comments will be short and sweet, so that everyone can keep the game moving.</span></li><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Challenges. &nbsp;</span><span class="c3">The encounters will likely test adventuring basics. Can you attack at both melee and ranged? &nbsp;Can you deal with swarms and other unusual creature types? &nbsp;Can you deal with damage reduction and incorporeal critters? &nbsp;Other challenges may involve social skills (charming people, misdirecting enemies or intimidating mooks), puzzle solving, or figuring out how to travel through difficult terrain. &nbsp;</span></li><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">10:30 -- Boss Fight. &nbsp;</span><span>You finally found the big bad that has been causing you all the trouble</span><span class="c3">! Hurry!</span></li><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">11:05 -- Chronicle Sheets. &nbsp;</span><span class="c3">The DM hurriedly signs chronicle sheets and fills out the required boxes, then hands them to you to complete for your records.</span></li><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Post Game. &nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Grab stuff, get out the door, hang out in the parking lot for a bit to come back to reality and then head home.</span></li></ul><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9 c5">What you should know</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>Your character is a member of the Pathfinder Society: the out of game and in game group of &ldquo;gentlemen explorer archaeologists&rdquo;. This is </span><span class="c25">the excuse to have you all together and adventuring without descending into cannibalism</span><span>&nbsp;a</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;bit of backstory you should think about when it comes to your character. WHY are they with these people? &nbsp;&ldquo;They&#39;re paying me&rdquo; is an acceptable answer, but not necessarily the most fulfilling.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Go on a pre made adventure. Finish it. Get a chronicle sheet. Usually you get 1 xp. Get 3 xp, level up. Wash rinse repeat.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9 c5">What kind of character should I make?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The one you want to.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">If you&rsquo;ve read the latest splatbook and gotten a really cool idea for the Cuisinart of Whirley Death and want to play that character, go for it. There will be enough for your character to do in the game to make it worth playing. If you have a fun idea that&#39;s not uber optimized, PFS isn&rsquo;t usually so hard that you need to minmax to the hilt or die. The society has enough in game reason to take either character and send them on an adventure: pathfinders inevitably run into something that needs a sword to the head and unique talents often come in handy. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">If you are deciding between a hyper specialized character and more of a generalist though, I would recommend the generalist. In a home game you can figure out who&rsquo;s playing the meat shield, the wizard, the skills guy and the healer. In PFS you play with whatever bag of mixed nuts sit at the table with you, and the venture captains send their characters all out on the mission. &nbsp;More experienced groups often have multiple characters they can swap out for better party composition, but even then sometimes the rogue with use magic device and a wand winds up as the party healer. It&#39;s far more important to be self sufficient and able to cover multiple roles in PFS than in a home game. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>You really should be competent at 2 things in combat, and at least one or two things out of it. Combat is a large part of the game, but so are investigations, deadly decadent courts, archaeological digs, and exploration. </span><span class="c13">Skills have a much larger role in Pathfinder society than they might in other games. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">How to make a character: </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">You don&rsquo;t HAVE to make a character, especially your first night. &nbsp;You can use one of the pregenerated characters. Some of them are pretty good.... and some of them are saved only by their animal companions. But for me and many others half the fun of the game is creating your own character in both build and personality and getting to say &ldquo;IT&#39;S ALIVE!&rdquo; when they meet a situation that fits them like a glove. &nbsp;Assuming you want to make your own monsterbait&hellip;erm... adventurer, here are some useful things to know.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><ul class="c12 lst-kix_o4sftcxhrwf9-0 start"><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Stats and money. </span><span class="c6"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://webpages.charter.net/tedsarah/Pathfinder/utilities/pointBuyCalc.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611440268314000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3douAIUrkBtoyJFREYGO3m">&nbsp;Point buy calculator</a></span><span class="c3">&nbsp;20 point buy.

Jacks and one eyed kings wild. </span></li><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Classes. &nbsp;</span><span class="c3">MOST class options in PFS are legal. A few exceptions are the Regular summoner (the unchained one is fine), the vivisectionist alchemist, and the undead lord cleric. &nbsp;</span></li><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Races. &nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Races are a little more narrow, limited to those in the core rulebook, Oread, Slyph, Ifrit, Undine, Tengu, Nagaji, Wayang, and Kitsune. Other races have been legal before, and there are boons (special certifications) that open up more, so you may see some even weirder pathfinders in your group.</span></li><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Level</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Start at level 1 </span></li><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Alignment</span><span class="c3">. Any non-evil. Characters can worship evil deities but must be within one step, so you&rsquo;ll have to match them exactly on the law/chaos axis</span></li><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Traits</span><span>: Two traits no drawbacks</span></li></ul><p class="c20"><span class="c5 c9"></span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c5">Is X legal?</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>For a beginner, your best bet is to google the item you want and &ldquo;archives of nethys.&rdquo; &nbsp;For example, let&rsquo;s look at the </span><span class="c6"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.archivesofnethys.com/MagicWondrousDisplay.aspx?FinalName%3DHelm%2520of%2520the%2520Mammoth%2520Lord&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611440268315000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1sCmtBRp4TT3qvkuTNjyWW">helm of the mammoth lord</a></span><span>.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c5"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>See the funny white X on top of the page? </span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 36.52px; height: 30.43px;"><img alt="GlyphOpenRoad.png" src="images/image1.png" style="width: 36.52px; height: 30.43px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c3">&nbsp;That&#39;s the glyph of the open road, symbol of the pathfinder society.

Hit ctrl F and the source it&#39;s out of to find the source, and then look for the item. Some of these entries are written as &ldquo;X Y and Z are legal&rdquo; and some are written as &ldquo;everything BUT XY and Z are legal. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Please keep in mind that for anything outside of the core rulebook you have to be able to show the DM the book that it came from, either as a dead tree book, on a tablet, or a print out from a watermarked pdf. This generally means you need to buy the book in some form to use it for PFS. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9 c5">What&#39;s this piece of paper?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c5"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">At the end of the game you&rsquo;ll be given a chronicle sheet. DON&rdquo;T LOSE IT. I highly recommend a 3 ring binder or prong binder to keep track of these, as they&rsquo;re very helpful if you can keep them in order. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9 c5">Wow, there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff on this chronicle, I&rsquo;m rich! </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Whoa there. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The gold you get from the scenario is on the upper right hand side. This is usually your reward. Just about everything else on the chronicle sheet merely provides access to the item, not the item itself. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">It doesn&rsquo;t matter how much gold you have, the society is not just going to hand anyone a vorpal sword. They&rsquo;re not going to spend the time and expense of finding, making, or stea.. Acquiring such an item for just anyone either. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Your character usually acquires access to equipment from the society in 4 ways:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><ol class="c12 lst-kix_8pbhxfuovcnd-0 start" start="1"><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">It&#39;s on a chronicle sheet.</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;You were the one that brought the item in for study, so you can buy it back once they&rsquo;re done studying it in between adventures. </span></li><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">It&#39;s on the always available list. </span><span>The society will let any members, including their most junior, buy mundane and alchemical weapons, armor and gear made of normal and special materials (other than dragonhide), alchemical equipment, scrolls and potions of first level spells. </span></li><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">You can spend 1 or 2 pp to buy an item worth up to 150 or 750 gp.</span><span class="c3">&nbsp; Many adventurers use their first two PP to purchase a wand of cure light wounds or infernal healing this way. Even if they can&rsquo;t cast it themselves, they can hand it to someone who can. &nbsp;This way, you pay for your own healing, even if someone else is operating your wand.</span></li><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">And most importantly, Fame.</span><span>&nbsp;You can buy any legal item from the society that you meet the fame score for. (See the chart in the guide.) &nbsp; As you adventure your fame grows, and the society is more willing to open their vaults or have their craftsmen make items just for you. This means that if you have a character concept that requires &nbsp; a flaming, shocking, mithril </span><span class="c3">kusarigama you don&rsquo;t need to pray that you find one on the chronicle, you can get it made. Your purchase limit USUALLY exceeds the amount of gold on hand. &nbsp; &nbsp;While chronicle sheet loot looks very important, in practice only rare items, partially charged wands, and items you can&rsquo;t normally buy (like an elven cloak of resistance) really matter.</span></li></ol><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c5">Factions</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">While everyone is a pathfinder, saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a pathfinder&rdquo; when everyone else in the party is also a pathfinder doesn&rsquo;t say much about your character. Factions provide a way of saying something about your character and giving you a little screen time to showcase your personality. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c27">The Exchange</span><span class="c3">: Make money by trade.

They want to use the societies enormous resources and knowledge for good. Paladins, do gooders, and general Gryffindor types. Rewards let you take people alive for trial easier, whack demons harder, and get you a discount from some good clerics. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c8">Liberty&#39;s Edge</span><span class="c3">. Free the slaves and ensure FREEEEEDOOOOOOM! for the inner sea. Rewards include an Entourage of freed slaves, kicking slaver butt, and ways to insure you and your allies are not bound by the literal and metaphorical chains of the oppressors! </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c11">Grand Lodge</span><span class="c3">: House Hufflepuff, loyal to the society as a whole or non aligned. &nbsp;Rewards give you bonuses on skill checks, and completing society goals. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c28">Dark Archive</span><span class="c3">: Collect, study, and preserve artifacts of a &ldquo;questionable&rdquo; nature.

Other adventurers go the extra mile, wrap the mummy in chains in their own sarcophagus, haul them back to Absolom and have them dictate their life to historians. The more extra credit you do during the adventure, the more you DO for the society the more the society will do for you. Try to think about things an archaeological association might be interested in: Artifacts, secret information, and NOT trashing the place so that you can work without the locals trying to run you out of town are some of the more common ways to gain extra recognition. </span></p><p class="c2 c16"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4 c16"><span class="c5">Prestige</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;is awarded, usually at 1 or 2 per scenario depending on whether you just completed the mission, or if you did something(s) above and beyond the bare minimum. You can &ldquo;spend&rdquo; prestige to call in a favor as simple as getting a free wand of cure light wounds, or even have someone scrape you off the floor of the dungeon and bring you back from the dead. I would highly advise spending the first 2 prestige points (pp) on a wand of cure light wounds, and then saving up the 21 points needed for a body recovery and raise dead. &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c2 c16"><span class="c9 c5"></span></p><p class="c4 c16"><span class="c5">Fame </span><span class="c3">is a measure of all the prestige you&rsquo;ve ever earned. It rarely to never decreases or is spent. Fame is incredibly important because it determines the maximum gold value of items the society will acquire for you. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c5">In conclusion</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c17"></span></p><p class="c4 c16"><span class="c3">Don&rsquo;t be afraid to give it a try. It&rsquo;s a great way to meet some new geeks, get in a few extra games, and try out some new characters. You&rsquo;ll probably find that once the dice start rolling not nearly all that much different than a home game. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c17"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.dropbox.com/s/8y5smf4ou8dkl6i/Welcome%2520to%2520Pathfinder%2520boon.pdf?dl%3D0&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611440268322000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3I6qqCC850yIXzj_eFWqfK">Download this boon for your 1st first level character to get you started!</a></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">&amp;{template:default} {{name=Justin}} {{Skill Check Result=?{Skills|</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Perception, Perception Check [[1d20+1]] &nbsp; |</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Acrobatics, Acrobatics Check [[1d20+3]] &nbsp;|</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Appraise, Appraise check [[1d20+8]] &nbsp;| &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Bluff, Bluff Check &nbsp;[[1d20+9]] &nbsp;|</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Craft, Stonework, Craft Stonework [[1d20+16]] |</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Knowledge Arcana, Knowledge Arcana Check [[1d20+15]] +2 more if i have time to check my notes &nbsp; | &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Knowledge Dungeoneering, &nbsp;Knowledge Dungeoneering Check [[1d20+8]] +2 more if i have time to check my notes &nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Knowledge Engineering, Knowledge Engineering Check [[1d20+14]] 2 more if i have time to check my notes |</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Knowledge Geography, Knowledge Geography [[1d20+10]] +2 more if we have time to check my notes|</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Knowledge History, Knowledge History Check [[1d20+12]] +2 more if i have time to check my notes |</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Linguistics, Linguistics check [[1d20+9]] |</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Profession Servant, Profession servant check [[1d20+8]] |</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Sense Motive, Sense motive [[1d20+3]] |</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Sleight of hand, Sleight of hand check [[1d20+12]] +4 to hide things on my person |</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Spellcraft, &nbsp;Spellcraft check [[1d20+12]] &nbsp;|</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Stealth, Stealth check [[1d20+7]] | }}}</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p></body></html>
