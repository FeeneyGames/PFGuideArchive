new Medium base class is one of the most open-ended and versatile classes in the game so far. &nbsp;It defies many traditions and assumptions of base classes, capable of swapping out its class features on a daily basis. &nbsp;It is reminiscent of Tome of Magic&rsquo;s Binder class, or the Chameleon PRC from Races of Destiny: an attempt at the ultimate jack-of-all-trades.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8 c7">The medium invites the spirits of legendary heroes and villains into their body, allowing them influence over their behavior in exchange for psychic power. &nbsp;In addition, they can commune with haunts and the spirits of the departed, channeling them through their body to communicate with the living. &nbsp;Few other characters are capable of changing their powers and abilities from day to day as radically as the medium.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8 c7">Because of their versatility, they are difficult to nail down with the &lsquo;tier system&rsquo; commonly used with 3.5/Pathfinder character optimisation. &nbsp;While they can dip down as low as Tier 5 or so, and come surprisingly close to Tier 1 or 2 by the very end of their career, overall I believe they average out to be Tier 3: able to solidly contribute to a variety of problems and challenges without world-shattering power.</span></p><p class="c3 c20"><span class="c8

c17">Medium Roles</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The medium was designed with versatility in mind. &nbsp;The medium is like six mini-classes rolled into one. &nbsp;This puts the medium in an odd position. &nbsp;Ideally, a medium is the fifth member of a party that already has all the important traditional roles covered. &nbsp;That way, depending on the foreseeable needs of the day&rsquo;s upcoming adventure, a medium can channel a spirit to lend support in an area that needs extra help, such as frontline melee, ranged DPS, additional healing, etc. &nbsp;In a party without one of these roles covered, a medium can fill in, switching out spirits during downtime or a non-traditional encounter, such as a social or stealth segment. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most mediums will probably wind up with a &lsquo;favorite&rsquo; spirit, the default that enhances what they plan on doing the most. &nbsp;A warrior will probably use the Champion spirit most days, while a caster-focused medium might favor the Archmage or Hierophant. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you gain levels, you can invest feats and equipment towards a specialization, or try to stay general and flexible. &nbsp;Specialization is usually to your advantage in Pathfinder; you rely on your allies to make up for gaps or weaknesses in your area of expertise. &nbsp;A medium can temporarily fill such a gap with relative ease, but if you stay too general you&rsquo;ll lack the killer edge.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would seem the best strategy is to have a general build or role in mind. &nbsp;Play a melee character, an archer, or a skill-monkey, etc., but if you have enough forewarning and it seems like you might be better off with a different slew of class features, spells, or defenses, the medium gives you the power to adapt. &nbsp;Your greataxe wielding brute can transform into a charming socialite, or produce a </span><span class="c7 c15">remove disease </span><span class="c8 c7">when such a spell might be unavailable. &nbsp;If your party cleric dies, a medium can fill in until you get him raised; the medium might even do the raising himself.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A more focused character will often do the job better than a medium, but the medium can always keep pace. &nbsp;Indeed, at the end of their career, once supreme spirit powers become available, mediums can even briefly eclipse other 1-6 casters, producing 9th level spell effects and other wonders. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7">Below I break down various roles and the relevant spirits needed to perform the roles well. &nbsp;By design, however, the Medium can do </span><span class="c7 c15">whatever you want </span><span class="c8 c7">passably at the very least.</span></p><p class="c3 c20"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c5">Combat:</span><span class="c13 c21">&nbsp; </span><span class="c8 c7">When it comes to fighting, 85% of the time you&rsquo;ll be relying on the Champion spirit. &nbsp;Whether it&rsquo;s ranged combat, STR or DEX-based melee&hellip; whatever flavor of fighting you prefer, the Champion will help you be a solid warrior.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let&rsquo;s take a look at some numbers really quick. &nbsp;Here&rsquo;s the full attack routine of a level 6 fighter, with Weapon Focus and Weapon Specialization in their favored weapon, before STR or DEX is taken into consideration:</span></p><ul class="c2 lst-kix_uyk7oo8k5g1p-0 start"><li class="c6 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8 c7">Attack: &nbsp;6 (BAB) + 1 (Weapon Focus) + 1 (Weapon Training) = +8/+3</span></li><li class="c6 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8 c7">Damage: &nbsp;2 (Weapon Specialization) + 1 (Weapon Training) &nbsp;= +3</span></li></ul><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let&rsquo;s compare to a medium using the Champion spirit, with Weapon Focus and Spirit Focus.</span></p><ul class="c2 lst-kix_l85xfnud9266-0 start"><li class="c6 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8 c7">Attack: &nbsp;4 (BAB) + 1 (Weapon Focus) + 3 (Spirit Bonus) = +8/+8</span></li><li class="c6 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8 c7">Damage: 3 (Spirit Bonus) + 2 (Seance Boon) = +5</span></li></ul><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7">That&rsquo;s not just comparable; that&rsquo;s actually </span><span class="c7 c15">better </span><span class="c8 c7">than the Fighter. &nbsp;The Fighter will have 4 more bonus feats to work with, better armor and shield proficiencies natively, and more hp. &nbsp;Due to the oddness of the medium&rsquo;s temporary weapon proficiencies, they would probably be using a simple weapon with Weapon Focus. &nbsp;Without the feat, they&rsquo;re still using a martial or exotic weapon; the Fighter pulls ahead on the attack roll, but the Medium still out-damages him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">Just for fun, let&rsquo;s compare again at level 20. &nbsp;The Medium has selected Greater Weapon Focus and Weapon Specialization as temporary feats with his Legendary Champion supreme spirit power. &nbsp;Both characters are also using Power Attack/Deadly Aim/ etc.</span></p><p class="c0"><span

c15">Interesting. &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">So yeah. &nbsp;The Champion spirit makes you good at fighting. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll trail behind a full BAB class in terms of hp, and they&rsquo;ll have various other advantages over you, but then they can&rsquo;t provide spellcasting on an off day, can they?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c21">Spellcasting: &nbsp;</span><span class="c7">This is a very open-ended role. &nbsp;If you take the Archmage or Hierophant spirit, the medium turns into a 1-6 caster. &nbsp;For most of your career as a medium, you&rsquo;ll function as a very bare-bones 1-6 caster. &nbsp;Bards have bardic music, the magus has spell combat, etc. etc. &nbsp;Mediums will have&hellip; more spell slots, and two spell levels higher than their normal maximum. &nbsp;Also, proper 1-6 casters will have </span><span class="c7 c15">way </span><span class="c7">more spells known, especially 5th-6th level spells. &nbsp;The medium knows a modest selection of 1-4 level spells, and gains 1-2 bonus spells known per spell level when channeling a caster spirit. &nbsp;These limitations are mostly a concern </span><span class="c7 c15">during an adventure</span><span class="c7">. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll have limited options indeed. &nbsp;However, during </span><span class="c7 c15">downtime, </span><span class="c7">the medium knows </span><span class="c7 c15">infinitely more spells known</span><span class="c8 c7">. &nbsp;They get to pick new bonus spells known every time they channel a caster spirit, so a medium can afford to pick up obscure or niche spells that a spontaneous caster wouldn&rsquo;t touch with a 10 ft. pole. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the offensive, a medium&rsquo;s spellcasting is handy if you know you&rsquo;ll be up against an enemy type vulnerable to certain types of spells. &nbsp;Going up against trolls? &nbsp;Pick up </span><span class="c7 c15">scorching ray </span><span class="c7">from the Archmage. &nbsp;Fighting undead? &nbsp;The Hierophant gives you positive energy channeling on top of </span><span class="c7 c15">cure </span><span class="c8 c7">spells. &nbsp;You can tailor your spells defensively by the same logic.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unscrupulous mediums can pick up </span><span class="c7 c15">animate dead </span><span class="c7">to keep around undead servitors; they&rsquo;ll continue to obey even after your seance ends. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re never more than 24 hours away from specific restorative spells such as </span><span class="c7 c15">remove blindness/deafness </span><span class="c7">or </span><span class="c7 c15">remove disease. &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">You have access to lovely divinations from both the sorcerer/wizard and cleric/oracle list. &nbsp;The medium gives you an incredibly wide scope of magic, you just gain access to it in a very narrow capacity in 1 day increments.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike combat, where the Champion allows you to keep pace with warrior-classes, full casters and 1-6 casters will pretty much always out-cast the medium. &nbsp;However, once you reach 17th level and beyond, a medium gains access to 9th level spells a limited number of times per day, a feat beyond most 1-6 casters entirely. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c5">Party Face: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">With a CHA casting stat, access to all important social skills, and the Trickster or Marshal spirits, a Medium can serve as a formidable socialite and party face. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll be just as charming to the living as you are with the spirits of the departed... </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c23">Party Support: </span><span class="c13">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">You can attempt to behave more like a bard, relying on the Marshal spirit to give your allies bonuses in combat. &nbsp;Unfortunately, the Marshal relies heavily on the Spirit Surge ability, and thus courts the dreaded influence mechanic. &nbsp;This role is inherently more risky for you, and much more limited in resource expenditure. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c26"><span class="c9 c17">Ability Score Considerations</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a class as open-ended and surprisingly complex as the Medium, they have relatively simple ability score priorities.</span></p><ul class="c2 lst-kix_ol7igpy57bka-0 start"><li class="c6 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c13 c5">S</span><span class="c13 c21">T</span><span class="c13">R: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">For melee combat mediums, STR is a priority stat. &nbsp;Get swole. &nbsp;Other types of mediums can get by with a modest STR, at least enough to lug their gear and armor.</span></li><li class="c6 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c13 c5">D</span><span class="c13 c21">E</span><span class="c13">X: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">Ranged or finesse melee mediums will have DEX as a priority instead. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re aiming for heavy armor, you can get by with a 10-12 here.</span></li><li class="c6 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c13 c21">CON: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">Everybody needs CON. &nbsp;This is of greater importance to melee combat focused mediums, who need the boost to compete with d10+ HD classes. &nbsp;Shoot for at least a 14 here, or a 12 if you plan on doing archery.</span></li><li class="c6 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c13 c23">INT: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">While skill points are certainly useful, there isn&rsquo;t a whole lot of INT synergy for the Medium. &nbsp;Considering the Trickster gives you two free floating maxed class skills, INT is the closest thing the medium has to a true dump stat.</span></li><li class="c6 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c13">WIS: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">With a strong Will save and Perception as a class skill, you don&rsquo;t need to invest too heavily into WIS. &nbsp;I would advise against dumping it entirely, but you can get by with an average score here.</span></li><li class="c6 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c13 c5">CH</span><span class="c13 c21">A: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">Your casting is based off CHA, so you&rsquo;ll want to have a decent score here. &nbsp;If you don&rsquo;t plan on using your casting too heavily, you can probably just put a 13 here, bumping it up to 14 after leveling so you can access your most powerful native spells. &nbsp;Mediums interested in the Archmage or Hierophant will want at least a 16 to access 6th level spells, and will certainly benefit from an even higher score. &nbsp;</span></li></ul><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c26 c20"><span class="c9

&nbsp;&frac34; BAB, d8 HD, good Will save, simple weapons, light &amp; medium armor</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8 c7">The medium&rsquo;s baseline chassis is a bit deceptive. &nbsp;On the surface it looks pretty unimpressive, essentially an oracle without shield proficiency, but the various spirits alter your attacks, saves, weapon and armor proficiencies, and more. &nbsp;Without channeling a spirit, a medium is a rather unimpressive specimen. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c9 c13">Skills: &nbsp;4/level</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8 c7">Mediums gain access to a modest number of skill points per level. &nbsp;Again, on the surface this is a bit deceptive, as the Trickster spirit can suddenly transform you

choice with your CHA focus.</span></li><li class="c6 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4">Knowledge (arcana, the planes, religion), Linguistics, Spellcraft: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">Other characters make a better know-it-all than you, but a smattering of knowledge here or there might be appropriate, especially if you favor the spellcaster spirits.</span></li><li class="c6 c22

class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mediums enamored of the Trickster spirit will find investing points in non-class skills beneficial, as said spirit can grant you temporary class skills (and bonuses to all skills on top of that). &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c12">1 - 4 Psychic Spellcasting</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mediums have the same spell progression as Bloodragers (with the addition of 0-level spells), making them the only 1-4 casting class published so far without full BAB and d10 HD. &nbsp;The Archmage or Hierophant spirit bump up your daily spell slots to that of a mesmerist/bard, turning you into a 1-6 casting class with flexible (yet limited) extra spells known. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8 c7">Depending on your preferred area of focus, your native spellcasting is either a pleasant footnote or one of your primary strengths. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3 c20"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c5">Sp</span><span class="c13 c16">ir</span><span class="c10">its</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the reason you became a Medium. &nbsp;Based loosely on the six mythic archetypes, the spirits transform your lackluster baseline abilities into a more specialized and competent character. &nbsp;Without spirits, you are little better than a gimped oracle.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8 c7">As you gain experience, your spirits grant you access to more abilities and powers. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s worth noting that sometimes a given spirit&rsquo;s latest ability might not be that great. &nbsp;In these situations, it can sometimes be worth it to channel a weaker spirit; you sacrifice one or more of your higher level spirit abilities in exchange for more free uses of your spirit surge. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll point out likely candidates below.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirits are a bit of a mixed blessing. &nbsp;The power they provide is great, but it comes at a price. &nbsp;First, a medium is oddly &lsquo;tethered&rsquo; to physical locations. &nbsp;Travel to unknown places can be risky for a medium, as they may not be able to find a suitable location to channel the spirit they desire. &nbsp;Most of the spirits&rsquo; favored locations are based within civilization, making a long trek through the wilderness or a dungeon delve risky. &nbsp;It would be a cruel GM indeed to deny you access to your primary class feature because you spent the night in the woods, but you must be aware of possible inconveniences. &nbsp;The Paizo FAQ suggests that a medium should be able to channel the spirit they desire if they can justify things appropriately; just be aware that the GM has the final say.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8 c7">Secondly, as you utilize certain powers and class features, a spirit gains influence over you. &nbsp;At 3 points of influence, you suffer multiple penalties (while enjoying a boost to Will saves against possession and mind-affecting effects), and at 5 points of influence you become an NPC under the GM&rsquo;s control until the spirit leaves (24 hours after the initial seance). &nbsp;While the consequences of this are pretty up in the air, depending on the GM and spirit in question, losing control of your character is always a bad thing. &nbsp;NEVER let this happen. &nbsp;Consider 4 points of influence as your &lsquo;cap.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8 c7">Ultimately, the influence system means some of your more powerful abilities are limited in usage. &nbsp;Spirits that grant powers without the risk of increasing influence are very useful, while others, like the Marshal, can accumulate influence insidiously quickly. &nbsp;Like the kineticist&rsquo;s relationship with burn, you will come to hate influence with a passion. &nbsp;I get the feeling there may have been some design disconnect or miscommunication when it came to the influence system; there&rsquo;s lots of stuff out there concerning Spirit Surge, or treating influence as a sort of currency, but there is very little out there to help you manage it. &nbsp;As of Occult Adventures, there are no feats or other options to help you manage influence, and the medium archetypes only compound the disadvantages of the system. &nbsp;(Perhaps Occult Origins will offer some relief.)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8 c7">I will break down the six spirits below in their own section.</span></p><p class="c3 c20"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c28 c13 c5">Spirit Bonus</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a nice little scaling bonus that applies to various rolls and stats as you level, depending on the spirit in question. &nbsp;REMEMBER YOU HAVE THIS! &nbsp;It&rsquo;s part of what makes you a competent warrior or skill monkey, and can shore up your weak saves.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c21">Spirit </span><span class="c10">Surge</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an interesting &lsquo;retry&rsquo; ability, tied to rolls influenced by your spirit bonus. &nbsp;Depending on the spirit, this varies in usefulness to great (an attack roll with the Champion, or any skill check with the Trickster), to very niche (concentration or Int-based checks for the Archmage). &nbsp;You get to add the bonus die after seeing the result of your initial roll, so you can play the odds and calculate whether it&rsquo;s really worth attempting. &nbsp;You don&rsquo;t want to use this ability willy-nilly, since you accumulate influence for doing so.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are various ways to mollify the spirits and receive &lsquo;free&rsquo; uses of this ability. &nbsp;The value of this depends on the spirit in question, your taboo, and whether it&rsquo;s worth it to channel a weaker spirit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c12">Shared Seance</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your seance boon is a minor bonus relevant to the spirit in question. &nbsp;Starting at 2nd level, you can invite your allies to participate in your seance to share this boon. &nbsp;The value of this varies depending on your party composition, but there&rsquo;s little reason for any of your allies </span><span class="c7 c15">not </span><span class="c8 c7">to join you in your spooky daily ritual. &nbsp;Like a bard, be sure to remind your allies of your little bonuses, as they can be easy to forget.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10">Taboo</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spirit surge can be really handy. &nbsp;If you are desirous of using it more often, you can obey a taboo, based off of a small list provided by each spirit. &nbsp;These restrict your behavior in some way, in exchange for two free uses of spirit surge; remember, you can only pick one, so you can&rsquo;t squeeze more uses of spirit surge out of it. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8 c7">Breaking your taboo comes with nasty penalties, potentially even barring access to a spirit for a whole week, so you want to be careful here. &nbsp;Some taboos are little more than an inconvenience, while others can put you or your party in jeopardy. &nbsp;In extreme situations, you&rsquo;re usually better off breaking your taboo and tanking the penalties, rather than giving away a vital secret or engaging a red dragon in single combat. &nbsp;Use your best judgement here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10">Haunt Channeler</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8 c7">Haunts are &lsquo;ghost traps.&rsquo; &nbsp;The frequency with which they show up depends on your campaign, so you may never get to use this ability (while you could swap it out for an archetype, most of the medium archetypes are crap). &nbsp;Even in a game with haunts, this is probably a somewhat rare occurrence. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp; This can be a flavorful way to learn more about haunts; many APs and modules feature cool flavor and history behind haunts, so you can learn more plot points here. &nbsp;Absorbing a haunt entirely into your body is risky, but it makes for an interesting strategy: your friends tie you up and throw you into every room of the haunted house, letting you suck up the haunts and waiting for you to regain your sanity.</span></p><p class="c3 c20"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c9 c13">Location Channel</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sort of like a bonus spell known, this power allows your allies to ask questions of the deceased. &nbsp;Nice and flavorful and spooky, this could be a nice tool for gathering clues.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c9 c13">Connection Channel</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">An improvement on Location Channel. &nbsp;Convenience! &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c12">Propitiation </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a painful wait, but finally at 9th level you can lower your influence score by 1, once per day. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s basically a free use of a more powerful spirit ability or spirit surge, but you need to do this out of combat, since it takes 10 minutes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c12">Ask the Spirits</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A risk-free, at-will </span><span class="c7 c15">contact other plane</span><span class="c8 c7">, this is pretty handy for information gathering during downtime. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10">Astral Journey</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve never understood the purpose of </span><span class="c7 c15">lesser astral projection, </span><span class="c8 c7">but from level 14 onward a medium can just do this&hellip; whenever.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10">Trance of Three</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this ability represents a marked increase in your versatility and flexibility, this ability is expensive in terms of influence, so you can&rsquo;t rely on it too frequently. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s limited to intermediate spirit powers, so the Champion, Hierophant, or Trickster are probably your best bet; a bonus attack, emergency healing, or sneak attack can be handy things to produce at an opportune moment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c8"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10">Spacious Soul</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weird class abilities continue to accrue as you reach the end of your career. &nbsp;This ability cuts off access to spirits, so it&rsquo;s probably only worth it in the direst of emergencies. &nbsp;Sadly, allied casters are better candidates than others, since they can still use their spells from inside your body. &nbsp;Hope you never have to use this; regardless, you&rsquo;ll probably only use it once a campaign or so if you get this far.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c9 c13">Spirit Mastery</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically two free uses of spirit surge a day, by this level channeling weaker spirits is ill-advised (unless you enjoy the Marshal), since supreme spirit abilities are extremely useful. &nbsp;Pretty tame for your penultimate ability&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c28 c13 c5">Astral Beacon</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c7">Oh man! &nbsp;Your capstone is </span><span class="c7 c15">huge. &nbsp;</span><span class="c7">Your flexibility increases insanely. &nbsp;Regardless of your primary spirit, you now have </span><span class="c7 c15">miracle </span><span class="c7">once per day, a pocket 9th level spell, 1/day ignore a single attack or spell entirely, can add 1d6 to any spirit surge-qualified roll for free&hellip; the list goes on. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s best to pick abilities that don&rsquo;t accrue influence, but this is a </span><span class="c7 c15">free action </span><span class="c8 c7">for you, so go nuts. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ve waited a long time for this, so enjoy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><a id="id.atmlcpfysk3"></a><p class="c26"><span class="c9 c17">The Spirits</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">Below I rate the spirits. &nbsp;My ratings are based off comparing each spirit to each other, how &lsquo;user-friendly&rsquo; they are, how much they accumulate influence, and how well they do what they&rsquo;re supposed to do on the tin. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, though, a medium is encouraged to pick the right spirit for the job. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s wise to &lsquo;build around&rsquo; a favorite spirit, using it as your go-to for adventuring, but versatility is one of the medium&rsquo;s greatest strengths. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c18"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c28 c18 c23">Archmage</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Easily one of the most powerful mythic archetypes, the archmage medium spirit is a very specialized one that doesn&rsquo;t play well with combat-focused builds. &nbsp;With a harsh influence penalty and influence-increasing intermediate and greater powers, this is a spirit to build around if you want to use it on adventures; otherwise, you might be better served relying on it for utility during downtime.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Archmage spirits are likely to be curmudgeonly, absent-minded, or insatiably curious. &nbsp;Some of them likely manifest from the foulest of villains, so losing control to an archmage can be potentially disastrous. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c13"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c23">Spirit Bonus:</span><span class="c13">&nbsp; </span><span class="c8 c7">While the bonus to concentration checks is nice, the bonus to INT-based rolls and skills is of modest utility. &nbsp;Spirit surge is unlikely to be in high demand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c23">Seance Boon: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">This minor boost to spell damage is nice to share with other casters in your party, but you&rsquo;re not built to be a blaster yourself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c23">Favored Locations: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">You&rsquo;re going to have trouble tapping into the Archmage in tiny villages, backwaters, and the wilderness. &nbsp;This is a civilization-bound spirit to be sure. &nbsp;That said, &lsquo;magical locations&rsquo; might afford you opportunities to ally with this spirit in strange and unexpected places.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c23">Influence Penalty: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">During downtime or a more social situation, these penalties aren&rsquo;t too bad. &nbsp;A combat-focused medium will want to avoid them like the plague during an adventure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13">Taboos:</span><span class="c13">&nbsp; </span><span class="c8 c7">Of the options available, choose the one that demands you never pass up the opportunity to learn something new. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s pretty open-ended and doesn&rsquo;t have much in the way of constraints. &nbsp;Of course, if you don&rsquo;t see yourself using spirit surge very much you probably don&rsquo;t have to worry about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p

class="c8 c7">This is the main reason to take the Archmage. &nbsp;You become a 1-6 caster, and get a slew of bonus sorcerer/wizard spells known. &nbsp;You can have a fresh set of new spells every day, giving you excellent flexibility, especially during downtime. &nbsp;You can use this ability to produce magic items, perform divinations, or provide transportation. &nbsp;The major drawback of this ability is that your bonus spells are subject to arcane spell failure from your armor, so you have to strip down if you&rsquo;re expecting combat. &nbsp;</span></li><li class="c6 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c23">Intermediate - Arcane Surge: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">Instead of burning a spell slot, you gain a point of influence. &nbsp;The spell also gets a little bump to the save DC and CL. &nbsp;This is likely a better use of influence accumulation than spirit surge, but you&rsquo;ll need to be cautious; it&rsquo;s one free spell a day before the influence penalty kicks in.</span></li><li class="c6 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4">Greater - Wild Arcana:</span><span class="c4 c23">&nbsp; </span><span class="c8 c7">While this is a handy ability to have in your pocket for emergencies, the Archmage continues to thirst for influence. &nbsp;This ability is less useful during downtime, so you&rsquo;re better channeling a weaker spirit in that case.</span></li><li class="c6 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c5">Supreme - Legendary Archmage: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">A 9th level spell of your choice is a damn handy thing to have in

c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13">Thoughts: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">The archmage is a crotchety, attention-seeking spirit. &nbsp;Although you probably won&rsquo;t care too much about spirit surge, the intermediate and greater powers will quickly pile on that annoying influence. &nbsp;This is the spirit of choice if you want to focus on offensive or utility spellcasting, but for 90% of your career most other 1-6 casters will be better at it than you. &nbsp;If you want to try offensive magic, remember to avoid spells that require attack rolls to lessen the burden of your influence penalty. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7">My biggest problem with the archmage is that your spirit bonus is </span><span class="c7 c15">almost </span><span class="c8 c7">wasted: INT-checks aren&rsquo;t your forte, and while the concentration bonus is nice, you get no other offensive or defensive benefits. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8 c7">Where this spirit really shines is during downtime. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;ve got days, weeks, or months free, you can become a handy source of spells, cherry picking from a large and impressive list as the need arises. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c28 c18 c5">Champion</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is your primary combat spirit. &nbsp;If you are desirous of getting up in your enemies&rsquo; business, or even being a stellar archer, this spirit will grant you the tools you need to succeed. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Champion spirits are brave, even brash, and potentially bloodthirsty. &nbsp;The echoes of great heroes can be found here, as well as savage bullies and brutes. &nbsp;Losing control to a champion spirit is a terrible gamble, and is almost certain to generate violence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c13"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c5">Spirit Bonus: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">Attack rolls, non-spell damage rolls, and Fort. saves! &nbsp;By the time Sudden Strike comes online, you&rsquo;ll start to resemble a proper full BAB class. &nbsp;Attack rolls and Fort. saves are excellent candidates for your spirit surge.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c5">Seance Boon: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">+2 damage doesn&rsquo;t seem

class="c13">Favored Locations: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">Most communities will have a practice yard at the very least. &nbsp;The &lsquo;places of violence&rsquo; location is of potential interest, as the site of any major battle you participated in might resonate as such a location. &nbsp;If your GM is lenient with this interpretation, you&rsquo;ll nearly always have easy access to this spirit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c23">Influence Penalty:</span><span class="c13">&nbsp; </span><span class="c8 c7">At low levels this isn&rsquo;t too big a deal, since all it does is cut you off from your knacks. &nbsp;During most of the middle of your career, you&rsquo;ll need to use caution, as it can cut you off from your highest level spells, and it reduces the effectiveness of the spells you still can cast in terms of duration and potency. &nbsp;While not especially crippling, particularly if you aren&rsquo;t focusing on your spellcasting in general, it&rsquo;s something you need to be aware of.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c23">Taboos: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">Of the options here, picking a single weapon you must use is probably the least painful. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll be kicking yourself if you face a challenge requiring another weapon though (ranged combat when you&rsquo;ve picked a melee weapon, say, or running into foes with an odd DR type). &nbsp;The taboo where you must accept combat challenges isn&rsquo;t too terrible&hellip; until the your enemies (or the GM) begin to pick up on it, and then you get screwed every time someone calls you out. &nbsp;Spirit surge is useful for the champion, so consider your taboos carefully.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c9 c13">Spirit Powers:</span></p><ul class="c2 lst-kix_ckqm33fngzjo-0 start"><li class="c6 c22

class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13">Thoughts: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">There&rsquo;s a lot to like about the champion spirit. &nbsp;Aside from spirit surge, there are no influence risks, and all of its abilities are useful for its intended role: offensive combat. &nbsp;The big weakness of the champion is the possible hit to your spellcasting; if you&rsquo;ve got friends that dish out the buffs, you won&rsquo;t have to worry too much about the influence penalty.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c0"><span

class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Guardian archetype is one of the least effective mythic options, since ultimately the best defense is a good offense in Pathfinder. &nbsp;The Guardian spirit brings a similar mentality to the medium, with similar end results. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If for some reason you </span><span class="c7 c15">need </span><span class="c8 c7">to turtle up, this spirit will certainly boost your defenses. &nbsp;It is utterly lacking in offensive tools, so you&rsquo;ll have to rely on your base abilities for attacks and damage, or else the buffs of your friends.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guardian spirits are likely to be conservative and cautious, even stubborn. &nbsp;Of all the spirits to lose control to, the guardian might be the least risky, as few villains are willing to put their lives before others. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c13"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c5">Spirit Bonus: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">Give this some time to rank up a bit, and you&rsquo;ll effectively have all good saves like a (chained) monk, with a scary AC to boot. &nbsp;Spirit surge will only apply to non-Will saves, so influence buildup will depend on the situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c21">Seance Boon: &nbsp;</span><span class="c7">There&rsquo;s no reason </span><span class="c7 c15">not </span><span class="c8 c7">to participate in a guardian seance, since everyone can benefit from a bump to CMD. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s the sort of minor bonus you really need to remember you have, though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13">Favored Locations: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">Guardian spirits are very bound to civilization; you&rsquo;ll need communities big enough to warrant some defenses. &nbsp;However, if you find yourself in a dungeon that used to be a fortress or castle, you might be able to commune with latent guardian spirits while adventuring. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c11">Influence Penalty: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">If you&rsquo;re sharing your soul with a guardian, chances are you&rsquo;re in the thick of melee. &nbsp;The last thing you want is a nasty penalty to damage, and the restrictions on your attacks and spellcasting are unpleasant as well. &nbsp;Avoid this at all costs!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13">Taboos:

&nbsp;You&rsquo;ll be taking hits, so the peak physical condition one is counter productive; you might be able to manage the vow of silence, especially if you&rsquo;ve got telepathy going, but it can be hard to avoid negative statuses that force you to break the taboo anyway. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c13"></span></p><p

c23">Lesser - Guardian&rsquo;s Shield: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">At low levels, you probably can&rsquo;t afford heavy armor. &nbsp;Shields are nice, but a heavy darkwood shield is pretty cheap and has no penalties if you&rsquo;re not proficient with them. &nbsp;This power can thus be negated by Armor Proficiency (heavy); you&rsquo;re better off with the Champion weapon proficiencies. </span></li><li class="c6 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c23">Intermediate - Absorb Blow: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">Some slow-scaling DR and energy resistances. &nbsp;These will pretty much

considering the Guardian is: why not the Champion? &nbsp;You can turtle up with your simple weapons, take feats towards an area control / lockdown build, and focus on tanking, but a Champion-focused medium can still do this, and likely do it </span><span class="c7 c15">better</span><span class="c8 c7">. &nbsp;The best thing here is the spirit bonus&hellip; </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&rsquo;ll ultimately wind up protecting your friends better by going with the Champion and </span><span class="c7 c15">killing things. &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">Sadly, the Guardian is probably the least powerful of the spirits; you can&rsquo;t really change the combat meta of the game.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8

spirits,&rsquo; the hierophant expands your spellcasting into the world of the divine. &nbsp;Like the mythic archetype, there is a heavy focus on healing, which turns the medium into a useful secondary healer.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hierophant spirits are as diverse in disposition as the gods and forces they serve. &nbsp;From pacifist priests to stern and distant druids to the nihilistic adepts of dark gods, losing control to a hierophant is as dangerous as the power of zealotry itself. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13">Spirit Bonus: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">Aside from Perception and Sense Motive checks, you&rsquo;ll only find yourself using spirit surge on Will saves. &nbsp;Considering you&rsquo;ll have a MEGA WILL SAVE while bound to this spirit, influence creep is likely to be quite manageable. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13">Seance Boon: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">The only people that will benefit from this seance are yourself and any other

class="c8 c7">Even the smallest community likely has a shrine, and you often find sites dedicated to the divine in the strangest of places. &nbsp;A lenient GM might allow you to contact a druidic Hierophant when you&rsquo;re out in nature, even if it&rsquo;s not necessarily a &lsquo;sacred grove.&rsquo; &nbsp;Lastly, a small portable shrine is pretty feasible to keep around, making this one of the easier spirits to contact overall. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c23">Influence Penalty: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">The social risks are likely manageable, but the restriction to non-lethal damage only can potentially be bad news, especially if you&rsquo;re fighting lots of undead or constructs. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re planning on fighting, manage your influence with care.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13">Taboos: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">None of these taboos are especially difficult. &nbsp;The paladin code is probably the easiest, considering the number of adventuring paladins out there that get by day to day. &nbsp;Avoid the truth-telling one if you&rsquo;re in for some intrigue or espionage. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c9 c13">Spirit Powers:</span></p><ul class="c2 lst-kix_yu4r1pklgrgu-0 start"><li class="c6 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c21">Lesser - Divine Surge: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">Like the Archmage, this is the main draw of this spirit. &nbsp;You can still wear your armor and cast your new spells, making it more adventure-friendly at any given moment compared to the Archmage.</span></li><li class="c6 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c21">Intermediate - Energy Font: &nbsp;</span><span class="c7">The language is a little unclear here. &nbsp;I assume they mean you can channel energy as a cleric of your medium level. &nbsp;If instead they mean you can use your new spells known a limited number of times per day, this is </span><span class="c23 c7">not so good. &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">If it works as intended, this gives you a nice pool of extra healing, and you don&rsquo;t have to waste your bonus spells known on the cure spells. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll want to avoid evil spirits that give you negative energy channeling for most situations, but you&rsquo;ll have the CHA score to make offensive channeling a more interesting option than a regular cleric.</span></li><li class="c6 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c24">Greater - Overflowing Grace: </span><span class="c4 c23">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">By the time you reach 11th level, the bonus this provides is so small, fleeting, and triggers on such a specific condition, that it&rsquo;s practically useless. &nbsp;Definitely summon a weaker spirit when this comes online until you reach the supreme spirit power.</span></li><li class="c6 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c5">Supreme - Legendary Hierophant: &nbsp;</span><span class="c7">Even with the minor limitations, having a 1/day pocket </span><span class="c7 c15">miracle </span><span class="c8 c7">is nothing to sneeze at. &nbsp;</span></li></ul><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13">Thoughts: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">For those interested in pursuing a more caster-focused medium, the Hierophant spirit will likely prove much more user-friendly than the Archmage. &nbsp;You can still enjoy your armor, get some nice healing abilities on the side, and will generally be quite helpful to your allies. &nbsp;Cycling through the cleric spell list every day provides some excellent downtime utility as well, as you can request the more niche healing spells as the need arises, or request divinations or other utility spells. &nbsp;An industrious medium could even become a part-time necromancer this way. &nbsp;The cleric list has lots of great buffs, so you can still mix it up in combat if you so desire. &nbsp;The Champion does this better &lsquo;out of the box,&rsquo; but using the Hierophant spirit doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to take a back seat when a fight breaks out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c28 c18 c23">Marshal</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marshal mythic archetype represents a great leader, capable of inspiring their allies to great feats of bravery. &nbsp;The Marshal spirit does this to a degree, but relies heavily on spirit surge to do so. No other spirit will accumulate influence as quickly as the Marshal.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you hit your influence cap, the Marshal becomes very close to dead weight. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll still dazzle with your CHA skills, and perhaps retain the ability to spam a 1-round party buff, but the Marshal definitely has the lowest &lsquo;adventuring endurance&rsquo; of any spirit.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marshal spirits are likely to be driven, emotional, and active. &nbsp;At best, they can be sensitive, gregarious, and inspiring. &nbsp;At worst, they can be tyrannical, egotistical, or just plain insufferable. &nbsp;Losing control to a Marshal is an invitation to great heroics or terrible villainy, and is all but assured to be foolhardy, or at the very least annoying.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c21">Spirit Bonus: &nbsp;</span><span class="c7">You already have a good CHA score; binding the Marshal will make you a social </span><span class="c7 c15">beast. &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">Importantly, you also apply your spirit bonus to all spirit surge dice, and the Marshal can apply spirit surge to all sorts of rolls.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c5">Seance Boon: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">The Marshal has hands-down the best seance boon, in that you get to pick one from any other spirit. &nbsp;From level 2 onwards, everybody in your party will want to get in on your daily seance. &nbsp;Mix and match for maximum effectiveness! </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13">Favored Locations: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">Another spirit bound to civilization, you&rsquo;ll probably need to be in a decent-sized community to have a guaranteed

c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13">Influence Penalty: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">Mercifully, the Marshal has perhaps the least-painful influence penalty of all the spirits. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll take a hit to Perception and Sense Motive, but as long as everyone calls you &lsquo;Captain&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll be fine. &nbsp;This is good news, because no other spirit is as dependant on spirit surge as the Marshal, so you&rsquo;ll be accumulating influence guaranteed. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13">Taboos: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">As long as you&rsquo;re not trying to lay low, pick the third option. &nbsp;If you don&rsquo;t have any summoners, necromancers, or other disposable-minion types in your party, the &lsquo;no man left behind&rsquo; taboo isn&rsquo;t too bad either. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll definitely want to take a taboo, since you&rsquo;ll need every last use of spirit surge you can.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c9 c13">Spirit Powers:</span></p><ul class="c2 lst-kix_cn0ihw6usl67-0 start"><li class="c6 c22 li-bullet-0"><span

influence system means you can only use this a limited number of times every day, even with taboos and your later class features, and even then only once per round. &nbsp;Used conservatively, you&rsquo;ll benefit from this a handful of times an encounter, and once you hit 4 points of influence this ability is dead weight (until level 17).</span></li><li class="c6 c22 li-bullet-0"><span

&nbsp;+1d6 to most rolls for free is okay, but it counts against your 1 spirit surge/round limit, and doesn&rsquo;t add your spirit bonus. &nbsp;This is actually handy for Astral Beacon, though.</span></li></ul><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13">Thoughts: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">Almost everything the Marshal does is dependent on spirit surge, and thus, accumulates influence. &nbsp;Even at level 19, assuming you channel a weaker spirit three times and take a taboo, you&rsquo;ll have 18 uses of spirit surge a day. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s a pretty decent pool, and allows you to add 1d8+5 (1d10+6 at level 20; not counting feats) to any d20 roll, but that&rsquo;s it. &nbsp;Every other spirit&rsquo;s spirit bonus is &lsquo;on&rsquo; all day, with other benefits besides. &nbsp;You become a small bonus factory, but you&rsquo;re cutting yourself off from your higher level abilities. &nbsp;Perhaps most frustratingly of all, you can only ever have one surge per round, on yourself or your allies.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly more reasonably, you can keep Inspiring Call and utilize your swift action to provide a bard-like bonus to your team, using spirit surge when needed on clutch rolls. &nbsp;This doesn&rsquo;t become really feasible until 11th level, though. &nbsp;If you keep your supreme power, you&rsquo;ll only have 8 official surges a day, relying on your +1d6 for everything else. &nbsp;Remember: this is level 17 we&rsquo;re talking about. &nbsp;9th level spells are being cast in anger. &nbsp;I would avoid the Marshal at the early to mid levels, only considering it if your party has all the important roles covered and you want to just grease the gears in the background.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c18">Trickster</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trickster mythic archetype is one of the most malleable, full of surprises, and this holds true for the Trickster spirit. &nbsp;While it starts off relatively modestly, the Trickster becomes a very versatile spirit in and out of combat as you accumulate more power. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s one of the best spirits for intrigue-laden or social encounters; any scenario where skill will win the day, a trickster is extremely useful.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trickster spirits are cunning, cautious, and confident. &nbsp;Many legendary tricksters were criminals, so it&rsquo;s unlikely you&rsquo;ll be sharing your soul with a noble being. &nbsp;Losing control to a Trickster risks you running afoul of the law, or even falling under the influence of a murderer or worse. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c5">Spirit Bonus: &nbsp;</span><span class="c7">You get your bonus to all DEX checks (including initiative!), Ref. saves, and </span><span class="c7 c15">all skill checks. &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">You&rsquo;ll make a bard green with envy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c21">Seance Boon: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">Basically a free floating skill trait, everyone in your party can likely benefit from what amounts to roughly half a feat. &nbsp;It encourages everyone in your party to invest a skill point or two in a non-class skill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13">Favored Locations: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">Tricksters might be the easiest spirits to get ahold of. &nbsp;Every town has an alley, and likely a tavern as well. &nbsp;Most dungeons could count as a maze, and many are laden with traps. &nbsp;The world is full of shadows, and within them likely lurks a spirit willing to work with you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c23">Influence Penalty: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">You&rsquo;ll want to avoid this if you can; paranoia doesn&rsquo;t help anybody. &nbsp;A medium works best as a team player, so manage your influence with care.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c23">Taboos: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">All of the trickster taboos are pretty harsh. &nbsp;Of the three, telling nothing but lies is probably the easiest to work with, but potentially disruptive in a social scenario. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c9 c13">Spirit Powers:</span></p><ul class="c2 lst-kix_uxp7c4q2mdg0-0 start"><li class="c6 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c21">Lesser - Trickster&rsquo;s Edge: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">While this ability starts off humbly, it is quite potent in scope. &nbsp;You basically gain two floating class skills with max ranks. &nbsp;Need an expert boat captain? &nbsp;Check. &nbsp;Whip up a stellar dessert for a testy genie? &nbsp;You&rsquo;ve got it covered. &nbsp;Need a master of disguise? &nbsp;Give it a shot. &nbsp;It only gets better with age.</span></li><li class="c6 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c21">Intermediate - Surprise Strike: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">By level 6, the Trickster becomes a viable spirit in combat, giving you a lesser sneak attack ability. &nbsp;The first attack is an automatic sneak attack if you can successfully land it!</span></li><li class="c6 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4">Greater - Transfer Magic: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">It accumulates influence, and is a bit risky to pull off, but stealing a random buff from a foe is a nasty surprise. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s forgivable to channel a weaker spirit at this point until your supreme power arrives.</span></li><li class="c6 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c5">Supreme - Legendary Trickster: &nbsp;</span><span class="c7">Holy hell! &nbsp;At-will </span><span class="c7 c15">greater polymorph? &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">This opens up an insane can of versatility for you. &nbsp;The possibilities are nearly endless. &nbsp;Note that this is less useful for Astral Beacon, since it only lasts 1 round; since it&rsquo;s a free action, you can just keep reapplying it, but it&rsquo;s a little sketch. &nbsp;This is best when the Trickster is your primary spirit. &nbsp;And hey, enjoy a free natural 20 on a skill check once a day while you&rsquo;re at it.</span></li></ul><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13">Thoughts: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">The Trickster starts off slow, but will always be useful throughout your entire career. &nbsp;By level 17 it becomes insanely good, but I give it the black rating overall as a good baseline comparison for what benefits a spirit should be bringing to the table. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8 c7">The Trickster is a great trump card for unusual situations, as long as you&rsquo;ve got time for a new seance. &nbsp;Whenever an obscure skill is called for, you can produce results, and still pull your weight in a fight. &nbsp;At level 20, you can grab any skill at +29 before ability mods are taken into consideration.</span></p><p class="c3 c20"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><a id="id.fjrl8o9mdcz2"></a><p class="c26 c27"><span class="c9 c17">Racial Selection</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8 c7">The medium&rsquo;s dependence on CHA is relatively mild, especially if you&rsquo;re not planning on taking advantage of spellcasting. &nbsp;Combat-focused mediums will want to prioritize their physical ability scores. &nbsp;In general, avoid races with a CHA penalty, and you should be fine. &nbsp;There are a LOT of races out there with a CHA bonus, so just pick one that also has a bonus in a physical score you want and you&rsquo;ll be golden.</span></p><p class="c3 c20"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c23">Dwarf: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">Normally a strong defensive choice, the dwarven racial ability score spread is not very medium-friendly. &nbsp;Their racial favored class bonus is too narrow to warrant; you&rsquo;re better off taking bonus hp. &nbsp;A dwarf medium will make a tough combat-focused medium, but is at a disadvantage for anything more magic-focused. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13">Elf: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">Elven weapon proficiencies make selecting non-Champion spirits a bit more combat-ready out of the box. &nbsp;Elven mediums are best off as archers to negate the disadvantage of their CON penalty, but most of their other racial features are of middling importance for most mediums. &nbsp;Avoid the racial favored class bonus; occult skill unlocks are fun and flavorful, but not worth investing resources into.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c21">Gnome:</span><span class="c13">&nbsp; </span><span class="c8 c7">Gnomes make fine caster-leaning mediums, with the defensive benefits of a CON bonus and being small-sized. &nbsp;By the same token, their size limits their effectiveness at combat slightly. &nbsp;Their racial favored class bonus is a bit too niche to warrant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c21">Half-elf: &nbsp;</span><span class="c7">Much like humans, half-elves are perfectly flexible and make fine mediums. &nbsp;No disadvantages to speak of, although their racial favored class bonus is the same as the elf&rsquo;s, and thus pretty pointless. &nbsp;If you plan on being more caster-focused, half-elves can pick up the amazing </span><span class="c7 c15">paragon surge </span><span class="c8 c7">spell, further enhancing your chameleonic adaptability. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c5">Halfling: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">Finally, a core race that actually jumps out as a really solid choice. &nbsp;Despite the hit to weapon damage for being small, halflings have the perfect spread for an archer or finesse-melee medium build. &nbsp;Even better, their racial favored class bonus actually provides a mechanically significant benefit. &nbsp;Seance boons are mostly pretty mild, but the damage bonus from the Champion spirit adds up; you&rsquo;ll make up for your smaller weapon damage dice in three levels, and consistently out-damage a fighter of equal level later in your career.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c21">Half-orc: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">Similar to half-elves, but with a racial favored class bonus worth a damn. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s wasted on any archetype that eliminates taboos, but a half-orc will see more mileage out of the Marshal spirit than other races (aside from humans). &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a mild advantage to be sure, but there aren&rsquo;t any other ways to squeeze more use out of taboos.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c21">Humans:</span><span class="c13 c5">&nbsp; </span><span class="c8 c7">For a class as versatile as the medium, it should come as no surprise that humans are a strong choice. &nbsp;Customizable in the extreme, humans are slightly more effective than half-orcs in the long run, with the same racial favored class bonus and the advantage of a bonus feat and skill points.</span></p><p class="c3 c20"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><a id="id.oclh45p8bw6a"></a><p class="c26"><span class="c9 c17">Archetypes</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occult Adventures includes five archetypes for the medium. &nbsp;The big problem with nearly all of them is that they penalize or further limit your interaction with the influence system, which is already extremely restrictive. &nbsp;In general, a medium archetype is going to wind up with fewer uses of spirit surge or other abilities that increase influence, which alters the value of the spirits they channel accordingly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c26"><span class="c28 c18 c24">Kami Medium</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather than inviting strange spirits into their soul, kami mediums channel the benign nature spirits known as kami. &nbsp;This is closer to a druid-medium with some Japanese mythological flavor.</span></p><p class="c26 c20"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c11">Kami Channeler: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">You lose access to the Archmage spirit entirely, which is a big blow to your versatility. &nbsp;The Champion also becomes extremely difficult to contact, as you must rely on the arrival of stormy weather.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13">Natural Taboo: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">You&rsquo;re basically restricted on equipment like a druid, but you get two free uses of spirit surge regardless of spirit every day. &nbsp;Druids make it work, and so can you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c23">Ofuda:</span><span class="c11">&nbsp; </span><span class="c8 c7">On the plus side, your spells can no longer be dispelled. &nbsp;The downside, even though a hostile target can&rsquo;t see their own ofuda, their allies can, and can remove your magic sticker with a standard action. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d say your casting becomes slightly less reliable overall. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c21">Shikigami: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">You lose some of your more flavorful class abilities in exchange for what will eventually be an improved familiar. &nbsp;Since your familiar is useful all the time, rather than a limited number of times per day or in rare situations, I&rsquo;d call this an upgrade.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13">Ask the Kami: &nbsp;</span><span class="c7 c15">Commune with nature </span><span class="c7">probably won&rsquo;t provide quite the same level of specific useful information that </span><span class="c7 c15">contact other plane </span><span class="c8 c7">can, but overall I&rsquo;d call this a wash.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13">Ward: &nbsp;</span><span class="c7">Merging with a ward is probably about as useful as </span><span class="c7 c15">lesser astral projection, </span><span class="c8 c7">so another wash.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13">Thoughts: &nbsp;</span><span class="c7">Losing the Archmage is losing &#8537; of your overall versatility and power, and you get basically nothing in exchange. &nbsp;The ofuda change to your spellcasting might end up more of a liability than a benefit, especially if your enemies catch on. &nbsp;If you like the flavor, it&rsquo;s still </span><span class="c7 c15">functional</span><span class="c8 c7">, but it&rsquo;s objectively weaker than a regular medium.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c26"><span class="c18 c23">Reanimated</span><span class="c28 c18 c24">&nbsp;Medium</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the more unusual archetypes out there, period. &nbsp;Rather than channeling spirits, the reanimated medium is channeling their own spirit, which animates their dead(?) body, making it alive again, somehow. &nbsp;You can only take this archetype after level 1 if you&rsquo;ve died, and there is a vague implication that any character could return to life after dying by taking a level in reanimated medium. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s </span><span class="c7 c15">weird. &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">And this is only the tip of the iceberg. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c23">Channel Self: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">Instead of accruing influence, you begin with 3 influence and lose it as you use abilities &lsquo;powered&rsquo; by influence. &nbsp;All of the influence transactions are reversed. &nbsp;So just after your seance, you are under the influence penalty of your spirit, but it goes away after one use of spirit surge of what-have-you. &nbsp;Rather than losing control of yourself at 5 influence, you fall into a coma at 0 influence. &nbsp;What happens after 24 hours, then? &nbsp;Do you fall into a coma and die? &nbsp;Do you have to perform a seance at hour 23 of your own possession without fail every day, or else you die? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It says you have a maximum capacity of 6 influence, but as far as I can tell, you can only hit a maximum of 4 influence after level 9, once you gain the propitiation ability. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What this ultimately means, by the RAI as best I can tell, is that you can only use influence-related abilities two times a day (three times a day after level 9). &nbsp;While you&rsquo;ll probably be walking around without an influence penalty more often than not, you wind up with one less use of &lsquo;influence&rsquo; than a regular medium, with no way to gain more, since you can&rsquo;t channel a weaker spirit or take a taboo. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c23">Ease Passage: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">While Haunt Channeler might be only sporadically useful, this ability is only useful if you die (again). &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13">Lingering Spirit: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">Another form of death insurance, but you don&rsquo;t really lose anything worthwhile in exchange.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c21">Spirit Warding: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">You lose a few more of your more flavorful or niche abilities for some nice resistances, and eventually immunities.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c11">Living Legend: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">You lose the awesomeness that is Astral Beacon in exchange for a stinking pile of maggot-ridden garbage. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13">Thoughts: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">For 95% percent of your career, a reanimated medium will basically function as a slightly-gimped regular medium, if the RAI functions as I think they&rsquo;re supposed to. &nbsp;You might as well multiclass, though, since your capstone becomes a joke. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would only suggest this archetype for the flavor, or if your character dies and there are no other options to bring them back, but that&rsquo;s pretty much GM fiat at that point.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c26"><span class="c18">Relic </span><span class="c28 c18 c23">Channeler</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather than worry about having access to spirits when their favored locations are unavailable, a relic channeler carries their connection to the spirits with them. &nbsp;This comes at the price of versatility; once a choice is made, it is &lsquo;locked&rsquo; for that spirit. &nbsp;This is mollified somewhat by the Powerful Bond ability, giving you one more bonus spell known / class skill / exotic weapon proficiency, etc., but you will no longer be the virtuoso of versatility that is the vanilla medium. &nbsp;You can&rsquo;t channel a weaker spirit, and your taboo choice is locked as well, so you&rsquo;ll generally have less uses of spirit surge, which is mostly a blow to the Marshal spirit. &nbsp;Lastly, should you lose your relics, you&rsquo;re screwed until you can perform a long and expensive ceremony.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You get the occultist&rsquo;s Object Reading ability, which is nice, and some of your other SLA&rsquo;s are swapped out for other stuff, but that&rsquo;s mostly the thick and thin of it,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c13"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13">Thoughts: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">The relic channeler is less flexible, and over long periods of downtime is almost certainly less powerful than a normal medium. &nbsp;However, as long as you make solid decisions, you&rsquo;ll wind up nearly as effective for the vast majority of your career. &nbsp;This archetype has the advantage of always having access to the spirit you want, and you won&rsquo;t be overwhelmed with choices whenever you perform a seance. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, I would argue that the medium&rsquo;s flexibility is the main strength of the class. &nbsp;This archetype neuters that strength; use it at your own risk. &nbsp;I would only advise it if your GM is a real stickler when it comes to favored locations for spirits, which seems to be against the RAI according to recent FAQ&rsquo;s.</span></p><p class="c26"><span class="c9 c18">Spirit Dancer</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the medium not complicated enough for you? &nbsp;Do you enjoy doing lots of math on the fly? &nbsp;Do you want preposterous versatility in exchange for yet another resource to manage? &nbsp;Look no farther than the Spirit Dancer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13">Spirit Dance: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">Rather than pick one spirit for the day, the spirit dancer contacts all six spirits, and makes all of his daily choices in advance. &nbsp;Then, he can access a spirit through a &lsquo;spirit dance,&rsquo; which is sort of like a rage mechanic. &nbsp;You have a limited number of rounds per day to use your spirit abilities, and are effectively sickened for 1 minute afterwards. &nbsp;This gives you the advantage of tailoring which spirit to use per encounter, but you run the risk of running out of rounds of spirit dance and being left with nothing but your baseline abilities. &nbsp;Your daily spirit dance rounds are increased by your CHA, so it&rsquo;s even more important for a spirit dancer than a regular medium.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can&rsquo;t channel weaker spirits or accept taboos, so influence-dependent abilities are on an extremely short clock, since influence accumulates for all of your spirits. &nbsp;You can gain a point of influence to regain 4 rounds of spirit dance, so you&rsquo;ll be even more reluctant to use spirit surge than a regular medium.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13">Spirit Aura: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">Your allies only benefit from seance boons during your spirit dance, and only if they&rsquo;re within 30 ft. &nbsp;This is mostly a downgrade, but it&rsquo;s the price you pay for versatility. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c5">Spirit Troika:</span><span class="c13 c21">&nbsp; </span><span class="c7 c25">It&rsquo;s a long wait, but at level 15 things start to get truly interesting. &nbsp;If you burn triple your spirit dance rounds, you can double up on spirits simultaneously, a power the regular medium can never experience. &nbsp;Suddenly, the Champion and the Guardian can combine, giving you a huge temporary boost to offense and defense, for example. &nbsp;This is a very open-ended and potent ability indeed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c25 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c5">Attacca: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">Few games will ever reach 18th level, but this is preposterous for a spirit dancer. &nbsp;It effectively allows you to &lsquo;rage cycle,&rsquo; letting you pick which spirit(s) you want on a round-by-round basis, with no penalty in between dances. &nbsp;Hope you like copious amounts of fiddly math!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13 c5">Dance of Infinite Forms: &nbsp;</span><span class="c7">Your capstone is basically Astral Beacon, giving you full access to your 1/day supreme spirit powers (you can only use one when you first gain access to them). &nbsp;Better yet, you get a discount on Spirit Troika. &nbsp;If you want to hemorrhage spirit dance rounds, you can channel </span><span class="c7 c15">all six spirits </span><span class="c8 c7">at once, although this is pretty wasteful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13">Thoughts: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">Spirit Dancer is almost an entirely different class. &nbsp;The regular medium is stronger for any situation where you have the advantage of time; longer, more ponderous skill checks, social situations, stealth, espionage, etc. &nbsp;The spirit dancer is stronger on a tactical level, encounter by encounter, but only really pulls ahead in the later levels when Spirit Troika comes online. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In practice, I only see a spirit dancer switching between Champion and Hierophant; everything else messes with weapon and armor proficiencies a bit too much for ease of use. &nbsp;The Marshal is too costly in terms of influence to warrant using, especially if you&rsquo;re concerned about spirit dance round consumption, and the Trickster typically needs time to scout, sneak, or use skills. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It makes for an interesting thought experiment, but it seems the regular medium is ultimately stronger. &nbsp;A spirit dancer is also much more likely to bog down the game as their spirit bonus and various other abilities keep changing around. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only area I&rsquo;m still unsure about is the Archmage and Hierophant giving temporary access to more spell slots. &nbsp;Do they share a single 1-6 caster progression pool, or do they have two separate ones? &nbsp;Does casting your native medium spells count against the Archmage and Hierophant? &nbsp;Ask your GM today!</span></p><p

bard and medium, the storyteller is&hellip; an option you can take, certainly. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c11">Diminished Spirits: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">So no taboos, no ability to channel weaker spirits, and you start with 2 points of influence rather than 1. &nbsp;You have essentially 2 uses of spirit surge or other influence-increasing abilities per day (you lose propitiation). &nbsp;That&rsquo;s harsh. &nbsp;You also lose seance boons...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c11">Knowledge of Tales: &nbsp;</span><span class="c7">You lose your </span><span class="c7 c15">spirit bonus. &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">It&rsquo;s replaced with an ability that&rsquo;s worse than bardic knowledge&hellip; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13">Versatile Surge: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">With no spirit

(</span><span class="c7 c15">microcosm </span><span class="c8 c7">in this case). &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c13">Thoughts: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">Perhaps I&rsquo;m judging this archetype too harshly; you&rsquo;re a much more team-support sort of character. &nbsp;But it seems the value of bardic performance is being overblown quite a bit. &nbsp;The main issue I have with this archetype is the extreme limitation on spirit surge and anything having to do with influence. &nbsp;A party-support character might be inclined to pick the Marshal spirit, but with only 2 uses of spirit surge before losing control, it&rsquo;s a waste of a spirit. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can certainly function, probably by picking the Hierophant spirit and just sticking to the back in a support role, but this is a much more limited archetype. &nbsp;I might suggest just having storyteller&rsquo;s performance replace spirit bonus/seance boons and allow the storyteller to keep propitiation, spirit mastery, taboos, etc. as a more reasonable houserule. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><a id="id.tkada0221zx7"></a><p class="c26"><span class="c9 c17">Feat Selection</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your spirits pull most of the weight when it comes to being good at any given task. &nbsp;You can focus on generally useful feats and rely on your spirits and spells for offensive and defensive options, or you can use your feats to improve your capabilities in a specific role, complementing your spirit of choice. &nbsp;You don&rsquo;t have a source of bonus feats, so you won&rsquo;t be able to mix and match too much, especially if you pick a feat-intensive strategy such as archery or two-weapon fighting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c18"></span></p><p class="c26"><span class="c18">General Feats</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4 c16">Additional Traits (APG): &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">Some traits are really amazing. &nbsp;Handy for expanding your class skills, shoring up saves, or boosting initiative as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4 c16">Combat Casting:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp; </span><span class="c8 c7">This is of most value to melee mediums that might find themselves casting in close quarters.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c28 c7 c30 c21"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Expanded Arcana (APG):</span><span class="c4 c16">&nbsp; </span><span class="c7">This feat is valuable for expanding your list of medium spells known, particularly for mediums that won&rsquo;t be focusing on the Archmage or Hierophant. &nbsp;Considering you can &lsquo;learn&rsquo; new spells every day, this is less valuable to mediums than it is to other spontaneous casters.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4 c16">Iron Will: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">Even though Will is your strong save, and you&rsquo;ll have lots of spells and class features to improve it even further, nothing messes with your casting ability like a failed Will save. &nbsp;Every little bit helps. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll be happy to have the improved version when you need it as well; consider taking it in a very caster-heavy or occult-y game.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4 c23">Legendary Influence (UI):</span><span class="c4 c16">&nbsp; </span><span class="c8 c7">Six feats for the price of one? &nbsp;This is the sort of versatility a medium dreams about! &nbsp;But&hellip; read this more carefully.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7">First, it limits the feats you can pick; item creation feats are banned. &nbsp;Too bad, too, as this would be automatically blue in that case, allowing you to pick item creation feats for your caster spirits when you&rsquo;re doing downtime.<br>Secondly, any feats you pick can&rsquo;t be used as prereqs for your actual feats. &nbsp;I thought it would be cool for a champion-main to pick Weapon Focus for a martial or exotic weapon, thus opening up some feat trees, but nope! &nbsp;Not allowed. &nbsp;(Okay, a 17th level champion can use it as a prereq for his supreme spirit ability, but </span><span class="c7 c15">come on</span><span class="c8 c7">)</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7">Third, and worst of all, you have to tank a point of influence </span><span class="c7 c15">to use these feats in the first place. &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">Your cap thus drops from 4 to 3, ruinous for a marshal-main and extremely irritating for everyone else. &nbsp;If you don&rsquo;t want to pay the influence cost, you&rsquo;re sitting on a wasted feat slot.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7">It has been pointed out that nothing&rsquo;s stopping you from simply picking Spirit Focus for each legend. &nbsp;This is </span><span class="c7 c15">cheesy. &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">It&rsquo;s also just about the only thing holding it back from a red rating. &nbsp;Make informed feat selections. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t gimp yourself for the illusion of versatility. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4 c24">Improved Legendary Influence (UI): &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">If you want to benefit from taking this, you start the day with 2 influence. &nbsp;That means using a single influence-mechanic ability earns you an automatic influence penalty, which is crippling for certain builds. &nbsp;This isn&rsquo;t worth it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Mage&rsquo;s Tattoo (ISWG):</span><span class="c4 c16">&nbsp; </span><span class="c8 c7">This is an easy +1 to CL if you&rsquo;re already taking Spell Focus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4 c5">Racial Heritage (APG): &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">This is a human-only racial feat, which you can pick up to take the halfling favored class bonus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Spell Focus, Greater Spell Focus:</span><span class="c4 c16">&nbsp; </span><span class="c7">I would only advise these feats for caster-focused occultists; as a 1-6 caster, your saving throw DCs will begin to trail behind full casters, so these help close the gap.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Spell Penetration, Greater Spell Penetration:</span><span class="c4 c16">&nbsp; </span><span class="c8 c7">Metamagic such as Piercing Spell is difficult for mediums to pull off, even with casting spirits. &nbsp;These feats are a simpler solution, and a wise investment if you enjoy blasting or you&rsquo;re playing in a caster or outsider-heavy game.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4 c5">Spirit Focus (OA): &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">Mediums only get ONE feat out of Occult Adventures, which is somewhat baffling. &nbsp;Perhaps Occult Origins will give them more love (like a feat that lessens the horrors of influence? &nbsp;Please?), but for now, you have Spirit Focus. &nbsp;Thankfully, it&rsquo;s really good! &nbsp;Pick your favorite spirit, and enjoy a +1 to your spirit bonus with that spirit. &nbsp;This is better than Weapon Focus for the Champion, since it also applies to Fort. saves. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a +1 on all skill checks, initiative, and Ref. saves for the Trickster. &nbsp;You get a lot of mileage out of this feat, although it&rsquo;s probably least useful for the Archmage and Hierophant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Steadfast Personality (ACG): &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">With your CHA focus, this feat helps alleviate MADness by allowing you to ignore WIS entirely and still have a great Will save.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4 c16">Toughness:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp; </span><span class="c8 c7">For a melee medium, this is basically essential; you&rsquo;ll need the extra hp to keep up with your full BAB compatriots. &nbsp;Archer or caster mediums can benefit from this feat as well, but it&rsquo;s not as high a priority.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Undead Master: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">If you&rsquo;re interested in necromancy, this feat allows you to animate bigger / more things at once. &nbsp;It won&rsquo;t allow you to control any more than you normally can, but it&rsquo;s helpful if you find yourself with a particularly large and impressive corpse.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c26"><span class="c9 c18">Combat Feats</span></p><p class="c26 c20"><span class="c9 c18"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Armor Proficiency (Heavy): &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">Once you can afford heavy armor, this is worth consideration for a melee occultist. &nbsp;The Guardian spirit provides you this for free, but it&rsquo;s pretty much inferior to the Champion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Critical Focus: &nbsp;</span><span class="c7">The critical feats are a late-career consideration, best if you&rsquo;re using a weapon with a generous crit range. &nbsp;Of the critical feats this unlocks for you, </span><span class="c4">Staggering Critical </span><span class="c8 c7">is probably your best bet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Improved Critical: &nbsp;</span><span class="c7">This saves you a bit of money on a </span><span class="c7 c15">keen </span><span class="c8 c7">weapon. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Dazzling Display: &nbsp;</span><span class="c7">With a CHA focus and Intimidation as a class skill, a combat-Intimidation build can be quite effective for a medium.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4 c5">Deadly Aim: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">An archer will want to pick this up eventually, once the essentials are obtained. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Furious Focus (APG): &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">This is a nice companion to Power Attack.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4 c5">Improved Initiative: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">Is there a guide out there where this isn&rsquo;t blue? &nbsp;Always worth picking up if you can.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Lunge: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">Another solid melee feat that affords you some extra casting security.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4 c23">Martial Weapon Proficiency: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">The weapon proficiencies provided by the Champion spirit are temporary, so you can&rsquo;t qualify for feats such as Weapon Focus with non-simple weapons without picking up an actual permanent proficiency. &nbsp;Racial weapon proficiencies are thus beneficial to a medium.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4 c5">Piranha Strike (PC: SLC): &nbsp;</span><span class="c7">Basically Power Attack for finessable light weapons, useful on a Two-Weapon Fighting build.</span><span class="c4 c5 c28">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Point-Blank Shot (</span><span class="c4 c5">Rapid Shot, Precise Shot, </span><span class="c1">Manyshot</span><span class="c4">): &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">These are the foundational feats for an archer build, and there are many more solid archery-related feats beyond these. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4 c5">Power Attack: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">The king of melee feats is a solid addition to any STR-based build.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Slashing Grace / Fencing Grace / Dervish Dance (ACG / ACO / ISWG):</span><span class="c4 c21">&nbsp; </span><span class="c8 c7">It&rsquo;s a little tough to meet the prereqs, but these feats allow you to get DEX to damage. &nbsp;Unfortunately, you can&rsquo;t do two-weapon fighting with these, or use a shield bigger than a buckler.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4 c21">Two-Weapon Fighting:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp; </span><span class="c7">Your access to the later feats in this chain will be slower than a full BAB class, but the Champion&rsquo;s spirit bonus and seance boon applies to damage on every attack, so this is a decent strategy for a DEX melee build. &nbsp;The Trickster theoretically benefits from these as well, providing more opportunities for sneak attack, but the Champion will out-fight the Trickster in pretty much all situations. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Weapon Finesse: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">This is a good backup feat for an archer if you can fit it in, and mandatory if you&rsquo;re going for a DEX-based melee build.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Weapon Focus: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">It&rsquo;s a prereq for several decent feats, but you&rsquo;ll be stuck with simple weapons unless you can pick up a real proficiency somehow, due to the Champion&rsquo;s temporary martial weapon proficiency.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c26"><span class="c9 c18">Item Creation Feats</span></p><p class="c26 c20"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the Archmage and Hierophant&rsquo;s ability to provide you with new bonus spells known every day, the medium has a unique advantage during downtime when it comes to item creation. &nbsp;For slower-paced campaigns, these feats will save you money and expand your options, both for yourself and your allies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4 c21">Brew Potion: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">Though pricier than scrolls, potions have the advantage of not requiring UMD to use, from yourself or your allies. &nbsp;A better choice for more industrious mediums that don&rsquo;t plan on focusing on casting during actual adventures.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4 c5">Craft Wand:</span><span class="c4 c21">&nbsp; </span><span class="c8 c7">Cheaper than staves, and more economical in the long run than scrolls, wands are also easy to UMD. &nbsp;They&rsquo;ll help add adventuring endurance to caster-focused mediums, and provide excellent out-of combat healing and other benefits.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4 c21">Craft Wondrous Item: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">The largest category of magic items, you can probably meet most of the prerequisites on whatever you want, keeping the crafting DC&rsquo;s low. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll need to invest more in Spellcraft than other mediums, however.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4 c21">Scribe Scroll: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">Reasonably cheap, and available right out of the gate, an industrious medium can create an impressive and diverse collection of scrolls given time. &nbsp;If you have a wizard, magus, or alchemist in the party, you can flesh out their spellbook every day of downtime. &nbsp;Scrolls are harder to UMD than wands, but a medium can rock a pretty decent UMD modifier when not channeling a caster spirit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c26"><span class="c9 c18">Metamagic Feats</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">You&rsquo;ve got two things working against you when it comes to metamagic feats: you&rsquo;re not a full caster, and thus have fewer spell slots to work with, and you&rsquo;re a spontaneous caster on top of that, so using metamagic in combat is cumbersome. &nbsp;Thus, you&rsquo;re best off relying on metamagic rods. &nbsp;That said, there are a few that are worth consideration, but only if you think you&rsquo;re going to favor the Archmage or Hierophant. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Extend Spell:</span><span class="c4 c16">&nbsp; </span><span class="c8 c7">Possibly the most popular metamagic feat, this is an old standby that&rsquo;s great for buffing before a dungeon delve. &nbsp;A lesser rod of this is nice and cheap, so you can probably skip it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4 c24">Intuitive Spell (OA): &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">You can negate the downside of thought components with a move action; using this feat will take a full round action. &nbsp;Grab a rod if you can spare some extra cash, otherwise don&rsquo;t worry about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4 c16">Logical Spell (OA): &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">The big weakness of psychic magic is emotion components. &nbsp;There are ways to defend against negative emotion effects, but inevitably something&rsquo;s going to get through. &nbsp;This is handy in rod form, but you won&rsquo;t regret simply knowing this feat either. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c26 c20"><span class="c9 c18"></span></p><a id="kix.ksm6vdye0era"></a><p class="c26"><span class="c9 c18">Trait Selection</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">If your game features the optional trait rules (and most seem to these days), you basically have two options: pick something flavorful or appropriate for your backstory, or min-max them like the conniving Munchkin you are. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ll be looking at &lsquo;optimal&rsquo; traits, many of which are basically half-feats. &nbsp;There are so many of these damn things, from so many different sources, that I&rsquo;m basically going to throw up my hands and say &lsquo;look them up on the SRD.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4 c5">Reactionary: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">This applies to any similar initiative-boosting trait. &nbsp;Going first is very important, so any trait that boosts this for you is gold.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4 c5">Magical Lineage: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">One of the only examples of metamagic reducers in Pathfinder, a wisely-picked spell coupled with this feat is potent indeed. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4 c16">Disillusioned (QaC): &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">+2 to saves against any effect that could shut you off from emotion component spells is certainly handy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4 c16">Focused Mind: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">Most folks might not have the room to fit in a feat like Combat Casting. &nbsp;Traits like this are a nice compromise. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4 c5">Fate&rsquo;s Favored: &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">Awesome for half-orcs with the sacred tattoo racial trait, this is a handy trait for anybody really. &nbsp;Pick up a four leaf clover or a luckstone!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><a id="id.mbbnpojzgp1a"></a><p class="c26"><span class="c9 c17">Spell Selection</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of the spirits you channel, a medium eventually learns a modest number of psychic spells, up to 4th level. &nbsp;Like the Bloodrager, you have a full caster level, and you gain access to 0-level spells from the get-go. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your spell selection is important for all kinds of medium builds. &nbsp;Channeling a caster spirit like the Archmage or Hierophant gives you more spell slots to work with, and while they give you some bonus spells known your base medium spells serve as the backbone of your casting capabilities. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your saving throw DCs will always trail behind proper casters, so it&rsquo;s wise to select buffs or spells that don&rsquo;t allow a saving throw. &nbsp;There are some pretty solid spells on your list, so don&rsquo;t neglect to invest in CHA for more bonus spells as you gain levels. &nbsp;Below I list the most generally useful spells, but you can usually afford to devote one or two spells known to more flavorful or niche spells if you wish.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, there is some overlap now and then between the Medium spell list and the cleric/oracle and sorcerer/wizard spell list. &nbsp;If an overlapping spell is somewhat niche or unlikely to be used in combat or on an adventure, </span><span class="c4">don&rsquo;t learn it. &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">You can temporarily learn the spell through the Archmage or Hierophant spirits (for example, the Planar Ally / Planar Binding line). &nbsp;Save your Medium spells known for spells you&rsquo;ll want regular access to, regardless of which spirit you channel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c9 c13">0-Level Spells / Knacks (6 known):</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c7">For your first three levels, knacks are your only source of magic outside of spirits. &nbsp;They&rsquo;re handy little things to thave, but you can pick whatever you want and still be perfectly serviceable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><ul class="c2 lst-kix_uf29qoe1xncv-0 start"><li
