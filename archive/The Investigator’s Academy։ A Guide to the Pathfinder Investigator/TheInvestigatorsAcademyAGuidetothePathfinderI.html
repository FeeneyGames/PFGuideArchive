At the end of the day, I hate expending resources in RPGs, and the promise of the skill monkey is a character who can keep performing essential duties as well at the end of a long day of adventuring as they can at the beginning. Once upon a time, bards and rogues were the only real classes that could fill this crucial role&mdash;but that all changed with the release of the Advanced Class Guide, which introduced hybrid classes more generally, and the investigator class specifically. Much as the ranger class benefited from being split into two more specialized classes (the hunter and the slayer) the rogue class also benefited from being split into two more specialized classes. The slayer took over many of the sneaky-stabby combat skills that the rogue chassis hints at, and the investigator was gifted with all of the rogue&rsquo;s skill domination, getting abilities like inspiration that make it a cinch to identify monsters on the fly, recall knowledge about esoteric topics, and figure any puzzle out in five seconds flat. Of course, the rogue is not the investigator&rsquo;s only parent class. The other is the fan-favorite alchemist class, which brings with it almost unparalleled versatility through extract casting, potion brewing, and more. The translation of the alchemist class doesn&rsquo;t preserve quite as many of the alchemist&rsquo;s excellent class features as I would like, but I accept that the two classes must be kept mechanically distinct lest the investigator become an &ldquo;alchemist, but better&rdquo; class as has happened historically with classes like the slayer or primalist bloodrager. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c1">If you&rsquo;re wondering about why you should play an investigator over another class, I&rsquo;d like to suggest asking yourself a series of questions to see whether the flavor and mechanics of the class will jive with you:</span></p><p class="c0 c2 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><ul class="c34 lst-kix_el2a0ztvb6g8-0 start"><li class="c0 c38 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">Do I want to be uncannily intelligent?</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Investigators will be the class that knows the most about nearly everything in the game; if you&rsquo;re curious to solve mysteries before anyone else, learn metainformation about what&rsquo;s going on with enemy creatures or the lore of Golarion, or astound people with displays of eerie intellect, the investigator has what you&rsquo;re looking for in spades.</span></li><li class="c0 c38 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">Do I want to strike precisely, exploiting enemies&rsquo; vulnerabilities for a kill?</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Thanks to studied combat, studied strike, and the many wonders of crushed Knowledge checks, investigators will always be able to tell where an opponent is weakest, then hit them where it hurts.</span></li><li class="c0 c38 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">Do I want to always have the perfect spell for the job?</span><span>&nbsp;Extract casting is among the most flexible spellcasting systems in all of Pathfinder. It takes only one minute for the investigator to brew up new spells, and feats like Formula Recollection, items like the </span><span class="c8">formula alembic,</span><span>&nbsp;and spells like </span><span class="c8">alchemical allocation</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;will let you consistently pull out the best spell you could possibly have available at the perfect time. Where other casters have to take an hour to prepare spells, you can be ready for anything with a minute of prep work&mdash;or even less, depending on your investment in talents like Numerical Alchemy.</span></li><li class="c0 c38 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">Do I want access to iconic, cool archetypes?</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;The bonded investigator, portal seeker, gravedigger, empiricist, psychic detective, questioner, jinyiwei&mdash;the investigator has cool archetypes bursting from every seam. If you don&rsquo;t like what the base class has on offer, you may just find what you&rsquo;re looking for in an archetype.</span></li></ul><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I hope I&rsquo;ve managed to make the sale by this point, because investigators truly are one of the coolest classes in Pathfinder, intellectually rigorous, alchemically stocked, and perpetually ready for whatever lurks in Golarion&rsquo;s darkest byways. And if you have questions, comments, or concerns, hit me up on any of the platforms listed on the title page! I&rsquo;m always happy to help people out.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With best regards for a good game,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c31 c6"><a class="c14" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.reddit.com/user/Allerseelen&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117394450000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1fbh8cgM0I_SFzWOJj2e8G">Allerseelen</a></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h1 class="c36 c5" id="h.ejc0fwgh21kr"><span class="c41 c6">INV 101: Class Chassis</span></h1><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span>I&rsquo;m going to try something just a wee bit different in this newest guide of mine. Used to be that I would simply give a rating of class features as I went down the line and leave it at that, but part of understanding any class is to really dive into the fine print of the rules text. If you misunderstand that extracts don&rsquo;t </span><span class="c8">entirely </span><span class="c1">work like potions and go handing them out without the Infusion discovery, well, that&rsquo;s going to be one unhappy GM you&rsquo;re working with. So in this guide to the investigator, we&rsquo;ll not only discuss what each class feature is worth as the investigator develops, but also what rules (implicit or explicit) you might be missing. Think of it as an exercise to improve your systems mastery!</span></p><p class="c0 c2 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c36 c5" id="h.6zzm0dms4qb5"><span class="c28">The Rating System</span></h2><p class="c0 c2 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c1">Throughout this guide, you&rsquo;ll see feats, spells, class features, etc. rated using a color coding system that was first introduced by Treantmonk and since copied in many other guides. Everyone tends to use their own colors, though, so here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll be working with:</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c35 c6">Purple</span><span>&nbsp;ratings are singular, the one ability at a given level or for a given playstyle that is cream of the crop. The apex, the zenith, the pinnacle: purple options are the royalty, the nobility. You </span><span class="c8">will</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;pick purple abilities, and damn the torpedoes.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c6 c7">Blue</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;abilities are the cream of the crop: options that define the way an investigator is played, or that otherwise provide some exponential leap in effectiveness. Try your utmost to pick up these options.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c12 c6">Green</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;abilities are almost universally useful, a good pick for nearly any build. If they&rsquo;re not gamebreakingly powerful, they&rsquo;re definitely holding up the line at a solid B+.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c15 c6">Yellow</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;abilities are our C standard, neither good nor bad. A yellow rating can also denote situational abilities that might be useful to some playstyles but not others.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c3 c6">Red</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;abilities are the traps. Stay away from these.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c36 c5" id="h.advl5vyfih3n"><span class="c28">The Chassis</span></h2><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c15 c6">d8 Hit Die:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Like most &#8532; casting striker classes (magus, warpriest, inquisitor, hunter, bard, etc.) you get a d8 Hit Die, making you squishier than your full-BAB cousins. You&rsquo;ll have to overcome this inherent squishiness with clever tactics and ample self-buffing from your extracts, but on the whole, you&rsquo;ll do well so long as you remember not to draw too much attention to yourself. Try to park Constitution at 12, minimum, and preferably 14. If you can&rsquo;t do that, consider the Toughness feat or choosing HP as your favored class bonus.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c12 c6">&frac34; BAB Progression:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Again, the other &#8532; casting classes all have &frac34; BAB, as well. This isn&rsquo;t too big of an issue, as studied combat will eventually put your to-hit rolls on par with (and even ahead of!) full-BAB classes. It will mean slower access to BAB-gated feats and fewer iterative attacks, however, so investigators will need to set simple build priorities that don&rsquo;t rely on a bevy of hard-to-get feats, then stick to those priorities.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c6 c7">Skills:</span><span>&nbsp;One of the defining features of the investigator class is that they&rsquo;re incredibly good with skill checks. Rogues get more ranks per level, true, but what they </span><span class="c8">don&rsquo;t</span><span>&nbsp;get are many bonuses to those skills above and beyond normal investment&mdash;a fighter who&rsquo;s heavily invested in Handle Animal is likely to be about as effective with that skill as a rogue. We&rsquo;ll get into the mechanics of inspiration later, but suffice it to say for now that this class feature, your natural Intelligence focus, and </span><span>extract</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;casting are what take you that last mile into skill domination. You can check out the inspiration section for more information on which skills you&rsquo;ll be investing in, and why.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c15 c6">Armor Proficiencies:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Getting proficiency with light armor only pushes you toward a Dexterity build, at least without modification. One-level dips in other classes are easy ways to up your armor game, and since there&rsquo;s no arcane spell failure chance associated with extracts, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about your casting suffering in heavier armors. We&rsquo;ll go over what these dips might be in later sections, but suffice it to say that a one-level dip of inspired blade swashbuckler is quite nice for Dexterity-based investigators and a one-level dip of fighter can do good things for Strength-based investigators.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c15 c6">Weapon Proficiencies:</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;</span><span>You get simple weapons, hand crossbow, rapier, shortbow, sap, short sword, and sword cane. That&rsquo;s not too bad! Assuming you&rsquo;re not dipping into any other classes to get better weapon and armor proficiencies, you&rsquo;ll likely go with the shortbow for ranged Dexterity builds (or longbow if your race offers it, like elves), the rapier for Weapon Finesse Dexterity builds, and the longspear for Strength builds. I&rsquo;d advise that every melee investigator also invest in a </span><span class="c8">+1 morningstar </span><span>to help overcome DR/Bludgeoning when it inevitably comes up.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c6 c7">Good Will Save,</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12 c6">Good Reflex, </span><span class="c3 c6">and Bad Fortitude Saves:</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;</span><span>Yet another reason to get your Constitution score up to 12 or 14 at point buy.

They&rsquo;re how the investigator casts spells, silly! Extract casting is both more powerful than prepared arcane or divine spellcasting in some ways (namely, how long it takes to prepare your extracts vs. how long a cleric or wizard would need to spend preparing their spells) and less powerful in other ways (e.g., you cannot &ldquo;cast&rdquo; extracts on allies without investing in an alchemist discovery, Infusion). </span><span class="c6">One very important feature to note about extract casting is that investigators are not considered &ldquo;spellcasters&rdquo; for just about any purpose!</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;I cannot stress how big of a change this is. Investigators don&rsquo;t have a &ldquo;spell list,&rdquo; so they cannot use wands or scrolls&mdash;ever&mdash;without a UMD check. They cannot poach spells off the samsaran&rsquo;s Mystic Past Life trait, because again, not spellcasters. Can&rsquo;t qualify for a whole slew of feats based on casting because&mdash;have you got the refrain now?&mdash;they&rsquo;re not spellcasters. Whew. Let&rsquo;s jump in.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c53 c10"><span class="c39">When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an investigator gains a </span><span class="c39 c6">competence bonus equal to his class level</span><span class="c39">&nbsp;on the skill check. In addition, an investigator can </span><span class="c39 c6">use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions</span><span class="c39">&nbsp;as if using </span><span class="c8 c39">detect magic.</span><span class="c39">&nbsp;He must hold the potion for 1 round to attempt such a check.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span>Alchemy hits you right off the bat with an incredibly large bonus to create alchemical items. This is not trivial! There are a million and one excellent alchemical items out there beyond your average, humdrum alchemist&rsquo;s fire, and given enough time and funding, you can reliably craft all of them. </span><span class="c6">Special notes:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;competence bonuses don&rsquo;t stack. If you get a competence bonus to Craft from another source, take the higher bonus and throw the other out.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c53 c10"><span class="c39">Like an alchemist, an investigator prepares his spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical power into a number of extracts, </span><span class="c39 c6">and then effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract.</span><span class="c39">&nbsp;These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator. </span><span class="c39 c6">Extracts behave like spells in potion form,</span><span class="c39">&nbsp;and as such their effects can be dispelled by dispel magic and similar effects, </span><span class="c39 c6">using the investigator&rsquo;s level as the caster level.</span></p><p class="c0 c2 c10"><span class="c32 c15 c6"></span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span>Paizo has caught a bit of flak for the way this is worded&mdash;by tying the class feature to potions, even conceptually, you open up a whole can of rules interpretations. The consensus is: drawing and drinking an extract is a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity, exactly like a spell. There is no such thing as &ldquo;defensive drinking&rdquo;&mdash;if you drink the extract while in an enemy&rsquo;s threatened area, you&rsquo;ll get hit&mdash;but there are also no concentration checks to do so, and you don&rsquo;t risk losing the spell unless the enemy chooses to use their AoO to sunder the extract. This is a mean yet valid option for GMs to take. </span><span class="c6">Special notes:</span><span>&nbsp;unlike potions, which usually take effect at lower caster levels than the drinker&rsquo;s caster level, extracts always use the investigator&rsquo;s level as their CL. In this way, they function exactly like spells. </span><span class="c8">But remember that investigators are not considered spellcasters for most purposes.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c53 c10"><span class="c39">When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. </span><span class="c39 c6">An extract immediately becomes inert if it leaves the investigator&rsquo;s possession, </span><span class="c39">reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping&mdash;an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every day. </span><span class="c39 c6">Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.</span></p><p class="c0 c2 c10"><span class="c32 c15 c6"></span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span>Extracts aren&rsquo;t potions, and they can&rsquo;t be used by either friends or foes without the Infusion alchemist discovery. Other third-party content creators (most notably N. Jolly) have suggested that this is an unnecessary tax imposed on the investigator and alchemist, and I&rsquo;m inclined to agree&mdash;granting Infusion at 1st level and allowing these classes to hand out buffs doesn&rsquo;t bust the power curve any more than having a different &#8532; casting class on the team would. </span><span class="c6">Special notes:</span><span>&nbsp;the 1-minute prep time is what truly makes the investigator and alchemist&rsquo;s &ldquo;casting&rdquo; special. While wizards, clerics, and other prepared casters need to spend 1 hour preparing their spells in the morning, the investigator can leave many of their slots unfilled, then whip up more extracts to suit the challenges of the day. Headed into a swamp that will likely contain poisons and disease? Brew up some </span><span class="c8">channel vigor.</span><span>&nbsp;Traipsing into a volcano where you&rsquo;re likely to face fire-based enemies? A quick </span><span class="c8">resist energy</span><span>&nbsp;couldn&rsquo;t hurt. If you really want to take this to the max, the Numerical Alchemy and Greater Numerical Alchemy talents will let you create new extracts within the space of a </span><span class="c8">round,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;allowing you to respond flexibly even mid-combat.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c53 c10"><span class="c39 c6">Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant</span><span class="c39">&mdash;comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. </span><span class="c39 c6">If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. </span><span class="c39">Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.</span></p><p class="c0 c2 c10"><span class="c32 c15 c6"></span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span>The main takeaway here is that the material components used in extract casting aren&rsquo;t significantly different from casting in other traditions. If you want to brew up some </span><span class="c8">restoration,</span><span>&nbsp;you&rsquo;ll still need to pay the material cost. I&rsquo;m genuinely unsure how to interpret the clause about spells that have focus requirements being ineligible to become extracts&mdash;just as an example, </span><span class="c8">fly</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;has a focus component (a wing feather) and is an extract. So...which is it, Paizo?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c53 c10"><span class="c39">An investigator uses the alchemist formula list to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. </span><span class="c39 c6">To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the extract&rsquo;s level.</span><span class="c39">&nbsp;The saving throw DC for an investigator&rsquo;s extract is equal to 10 + the extract&rsquo;s level + the investigator&rsquo;s Intelligence modifier.</span></p><p class="c0 c2 c10"><span class="c32 c15 c6"></span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span>The bulk of your extracts are personal affairs that won&rsquo;t interact with enemies at all. It&rsquo;s therefore perfectly okay to build an investigator (especially a combat-focused investigator) with only a halfway-decent Intelligence score&mdash;say, a 15 at point buy, with the goal of bumping up to a 16 at 4th level. Sure, you can get </span><span class="c8">more</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;extracts by investing more, and your skills, inspiration, and studied combat will benefit, but it&rsquo;s not strictly necessary for casting.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c53 c10"><span class="c39">An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1st-level formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modifier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create.</span><span class="c39 c6">&nbsp;An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements</span><span class="c39">. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook. </span><span class="c39 c6">An investigator can study a wizard&rsquo;s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains</span><span class="c39">. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. </span><span class="c39 c6">An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator&rsquo;s or an alchemist&rsquo;s formula book (and vice versa).</span><span class="c39">&nbsp;An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.</span></p><p class="c0 c2 c10"><span class="c32 c15 c6"></span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span>Between the 1-minute prep time and the ability to have a whole slew of spells in your formula book, investigators can truly become masters of versatility.

A key strategic aspect to building an investigator is to figure out how you&rsquo;re going to extend the mileage of your inspiration pool. Let&rsquo;s do our quick rules rundown:</span></p><p class="c0 c2 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c53 c10"><span class="c39">An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&rsquo;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&rsquo;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. </span><span class="c39 c6">This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed.</span><span class="c39">&nbsp;An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. </span><span class="c39 c6">The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&rsquo;s trained in the skill.</span></p><p class="c0 c2 c10"><span class="c32 c15 c6"></span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span>The key takeaway from this paragraph is </span><span class="c8">when</span><span>&nbsp;you get to choose to use inspiration or not: after you roll the d20, but before you know whether you succeeded or failed. This is vital! If you&rsquo;re trying to escape a grapple using Escape Artist and roll a &ldquo;tweener&rdquo; roll like a 9, 10, or 11, the extra few points from inspiration might be enough to put you over the edge into success. If you&rsquo;re confident that you crushed it with an 18, 19, or 20, you can safely leave inspiration in its holster. The other aspect to remember about inspiration is that you get it for free on some checks&mdash;</span><span class="c8">but only if you have at least one skill rank invested.</span><span>&nbsp;If a Knowlege (History) check comes up and you didn&rsquo;t invest one point to get 1 Skill Rank + 3 Class Skill + 3.5 Inspiration, you&rsquo;re going to feel pretty dumb. Make it a rule to always invest at least one skill rank in skills that you could get free inspiration for.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c20 c6"></span></p><p class="c0 c53 c10"><span class="c39 c6">Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&rsquo;s pool.</span><span class="c39">&nbsp;In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</span></p><p class="c0 c2 c10"><span class="c32 c15 c6"></span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span>But wait! Inspiration isn&rsquo;t just for skill checks! You can also use it to bolster saves and attack rolls. Remember </span><span class="c8">when</span><span>&nbsp;you get to use it, though: after the d20 roll, but before you learn whether you succeeded or failed. These uses are extra expensive, so you need to play like your 18 Intelligence character would and really pick and choose your battles. If you know that failing the Fortitude save will mean you&rsquo;re shaken for 1 round, yeah, maybe not. If you&rsquo;re getting attacked by ghouls and know that failing the Fortitude save will mean you become paralyzed for 1d4+1 rounds, heck yes, burn that inspiration to the ground! Just remember, though, that you can&rsquo;t take more than one immediate action in a round, and that it eats up your swift action on your next turn. You can&rsquo;t burn inspiration to pass a series of saves thrown at you when it&rsquo;s not your turn. The Combat Inspiration and Greater Combat Inspiration talents (or </span><span class="c8">inspired</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;weapon enchantment) will really serve you well if you want to use inspiration offensively more often; you&rsquo;ll get them as you move up in level.</span></p><p class="c0 c2 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c1">And now that we&rsquo;ve covered inspiration, the mechanic that lets you achieve total skill domination, what should we be looking at putting our many skill ranks into?</span></p><p class="c0 c2 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><ul class="c34 lst-kix_h2vmqcqfp8av-0 start"><li class="c0 c38 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Knowledge (Arcana, Dungeoneering, Local, Nature, Planes, Religion):</span><span>&nbsp;With the possible exceptions of bards and wizards, investigators are Pathfinder&rsquo;s premiere knowledge jockeys, which means that the task of monster identification will fall to you much of the time.

Poison is always pricey and only sporadically effective in Pathfinder, and the investigator can&rsquo;t even poison as well as the alchemist, whose discoveries can improve the poison game significantly. You&rsquo;re far better off trading poison lore away for something better.</span></p><p class="c0 c2 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c6">(2)</span><span class="c15 c6">&nbsp;Poison Resistance:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;You do have a weak Fortitude save, and poison effects generally target Fortitude. Remember that this bonus is untyped, first, and that it applies to any spell with the [poison] descriptor or any (Su) or (Ex) ability that specifically calls out being a poison effect. I&rsquo;d recommend you trade away poison resistance, too, but the immunity at 11th level is lovely if you decide to keep it around.</span></p><p class="c0 c2 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c6">(3) Investigator Talents:</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">Now</span><span>&nbsp;we&rsquo;re talking. Investigator talents are as good as alchemist discoveries or ninja tricks, and can generally be separated into a few categories: talents that improve your skill checks or inspiration, talents that improve your studied combat or studied strike class features, miscellaneous talents, and talents that poach class features from the alchemist or rogue. The </span><span class="c31"><a class="c14" href="#h.fxqmbi44xm82">Talents section</a></span><span>&nbsp;has the complete rundown. </span><span class="c6">Special notes:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;because you do not gain the investigator talent class feature until 3rd level, you cannot select the Extra Investigator Talent feat until then. This becomes particularly problematic for investigator archetypes that trade away their first few investigator talents, as the level at which you could supplement your talent progression with Extra Investigator Talent is pushed back in parallel with the class feature itself! I&rsquo;ll call out archetypes that push this mechanic too hard; you really do need your talents.</span></p><p class="c0 c2 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c6">(3) </span><span class="c3 c6">Keen Recollection:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Even History, Geography, Nobility, and Engineering deserve at least one skill rank in order to collect your free uses of inspiration. Given that, why would you need keen recollection?</span></p><p class="c0 c2 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c6">(3) </span><span class="c15 c6">Trap Sense:</span><span>&nbsp;As with trapfinding, you&rsquo;d need to be invested in becoming a dedicated trapfinder in order to make good use of trap sense. This is also prime real estate for an archetype trade, so don&rsquo;t feel too attached to it if you don&rsquo;t feel like you need it. </span><span class="c6">Special notes:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;dodge bonuses stack with other dodge bonuses. Wipe that nervous brow sweat away, my friend.</span></p><p class="c0 c2 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c6">(4) </span><span class="c6 c7">Studied Combat:</span><span>&nbsp;Inspiration, alchemy, and studied combat are the cornerstones of investigators. Everything else? Window dressing. So, then, what does it do? In short, studied combat gives you huge insight bonuses to attack and damage rolls against a single target that you&rsquo;ve studied as a move action. When I say &ldquo;huge insight bonuses to attack and damage rolls,&rdquo; I mean it, too&mdash;at 20th level, you&rsquo;ll be rocking a +25/+20/+15 full-attack rotation with a +10 damage bonus to each attack. For reference, a fighter at that same level will be doling out +25/+20/+15/+10 with a +5 damage bonus to each attack. Now, I&rsquo;m not saying the investigator is better at combat than the fighter, especially once you factor in crits and precision damage, but with self-buffing extracts, studied combat, mutagens, etc., investigators can more than hold their own. A few rules text items to consider:</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c20 c6"></span></p><p class="c0 c53 c10"><span class="c39">With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a </span><span class="c6 c39">move action </span><span class="c39">to study a single enemy </span><span class="c39 c6">that he can see.</span><span class="c39">&nbsp;Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an </span><span class="c39 c6">insight bonus</span><span class="c39">&nbsp;on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. </span><span class="c45 c39 c6">This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</span></p><p class="c0 c53 c2 c10"><span class="c45 c39 c6"></span></p><p class="c0 c10 c53"><span class="c39">An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and </span><span class="c39 c6">once a creature has become the target of an investigator&rsquo;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&rsquo;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</span></p><p class="c0 c2 c10"><span class="c32 c15 c6"></span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span>It&rsquo;s always a move action to initiate studied combat, and you can&rsquo;t study enemies that you can&rsquo;t see due to blindness, total cover, </span><span class="c8">invisibility, deeper darkness,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">obscuring mist,</span><span>&nbsp;Stealth checks, etc. Your bonus is an insight bonus; these don&rsquo;t stack with themselves, but the only other insight bonus you have to attack rolls is </span><span class="c8">true strike,</span><span>&nbsp;and a +20 will beat out studied combat&rsquo;s bonus even at 20th level. </span><span class="c6">Crucially,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">your studied combat ends if you hit someone with a studied strike.</span><span>&nbsp;Under no circumstances do you want to end a studied combat prematurely unless you can be sure that an opponent will die from your studied strike! If you hit with a studied strike and the opponent is still standing, you&rsquo;ve blown your biggest bonus to attack and damage and will have to pay both the action and inspiration cost to re-subscribe. Don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t let that happen! Part of becoming a good investigator player is understanding that yielding to the temptation of a studied strike is a trap in many scenarios. Save it for when studied combat is about to expire or something is about to change drastically in the flow of battle&mdash;you&rsquo;re about to go unconscious, you got a huge 1-round buff from an ally, your GM tips their cap that the enemy is about to die, etc. The last thing to note is that both studied combat and studied strike are precision damage. Crit fishing is definitely something that investigators can do, but it won&rsquo;t help your damage output much. We&rsquo;ll consider special weapon enchantments and the </span><span class="c31"><a class="c14" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?sa%3Dt%26rct%3Dj%26q%3D%26esrc%3Ds%26source%3Dweb%26cd%3D%26cad%3Drja%26uact%3D8%26ved%3D2ahUKEwi58N_Q_ILqAhUsSjABHWzOAGsQFjAAegQIAhAB%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Faonprd.com%252FFeatDisplay.aspx%253FItemName%253DButterfly%252527s%252520Sting%26usg%3DAOvVaw2iOd_ml-pWqLWRINl81LTb&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117394481000&amp;usg=AOvVaw00mgQf9SchmzV9Ihf_D69S">Butterfly&rsquo;s Sting feat</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;to alleviate this issue.</span></p><p class="c0 c2 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c6">(4) </span><span class="c12 c6">Studied Strike:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Ahhh, studied strike. So flashy, yet so dangerous to the wielder. Taking our hypothetical 20th-level investigator as an example yet again, let&rsquo;s consider two different attack approaches, one using studied strike prematurely, the other holding off. To illustrate, we&rsquo;ll make simplistic assumptions: a 20th-level investigator with 10 Strength, 10 Dexterity, and a mundane rapier is within full-attack range and is attacking an enemy with AC 30 using a +15/+10/+5, 1d6+0 damage scheme. (Like I said, very simplistic.) Here&rsquo;s how the different tactics fare:</span></p><p class="c0 c2 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><a id="t.d92a5b6bd39c1348fdc6505fc1c6713e59c5ead2"></a><a id="t.0"></a><table class="c29"><tbody><tr class="c18"><td class="c24" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span class="c20 c6">Round</span></p></td><td class="c65" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span class="c20 c6">Studied Strike:</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c20 c6">Way Too Soon</span></p></td><td class="c43" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span class="c20 c6">Studied Strike:</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c20 c6">Just Right</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c18"><td class="c24" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span class="c20 c6">Round 1</span></p></td><td class="c65" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c47"><span class="c1">(SC) +25, or 80% chance to hit.</span></p><p class="c47"><span class="c20 c6">(SS) 1d6+9d6 damage, average 33.</span></p><p class="c47 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c47"><span class="c1">(No SC) +10, or 5% chance to hit.</span></p><p class="c47"><span class="c1">(No SS) 1d6 damage, average &lt;1.</span></p><p class="c47 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c47"><span class="c1">(No SC) +5, or 5% chance to hit.</span></p><p class="c47"><span class="c1">(No SS) 1d6 damage, average &lt;1. </span></p><p class="c47 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c47"><span class="c20 c6">Total: 35</span></p></td><td class="c43" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c47"><span class="c1">(SC) +25, or 80% chance to hit.</span></p><p class="c47"><span class="c1">(No SS) 1d6+10 damage, average 10.8.</span></p><p class="c47 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c47"><span class="c1">(SC) +20, or 55% chance to hit.</span></p><p class="c47"><span class="c1">(No SS) 1d6+10 damage, average 7.4.</span></p><p class="c47 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c47"><span class="c1">(SC) +15, or 30% chance to hit.</span></p><p class="c47"><span class="c1">(No SS) 1d6+10 damage, average 4.</span></p><p class="c47 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c47"><span class="c20 c6">Total: 22.2</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c18"><td class="c24" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span class="c20 c6">Round 2</span></p></td><td class="c65" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c47"><span class="c1">(No SC) +15, or 25% chance to hit.</span></p><p class="c47"><span class="c1">(No SS) 1d6 damage, average &lt;1.</span></p><p class="c47 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c47"><span class="c1">(No SC) +10, or 5% chance to hit.</span></p><p class="c47"><span class="c1">(No SS) 1d6 damage, average &lt;1.</span></p><p class="c47 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c47"><span class="c1">(No SC) +5, or 5% chance to hit.</span></p><p class="c47"><span class="c1">(No SS) 1d6 damage, average &lt;1. </span></p><p class="c47 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c47"><span class="c20 c6">Total: 38</span></p></td><td class="c43" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c47"><span class="c1">(SC) +25, or 80% chance to hit.</span></p><p class="c47"><span class="c1">(No SS) 1d6+10 damage, average 10.8.</span></p><p class="c47 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c47"><span class="c1">(SC) +20, or 55% chance to hit.</span></p><p class="c47"><span class="c1">(No SS) 1d6+10 damage, average 7.4.</span></p><p class="c47 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c47"><span class="c1">(SC) +15, or 30% chance to hit.</span></p><p class="c47"><span class="c1">(No SS) 1d6+10 damage, average 4.</span></p><p class="c47 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c47"><span class="c20 c6">Total: 44.4</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c0 c2 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>As you can see from this simplistic simulation, investigators </span><span class="c8">need</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;studied combat in order to keep their attack and damage rolls relevant throughout the game. If you blow your studied combat as soon as you possibly can for that burst of studied strike damage (which actually isn&rsquo;t that large, in the grand scheme of things) the investigator next to you who kept studied combat up will outpace you within two rounds. You don&rsquo;t want that, right? So really truly, take my advice and save your studied strike for the ideal moment. Your teammates and combat effectiveness will thank me later.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a rules perspective, there&rsquo;s not much that we need to know about studied strike that we didn&rsquo;t already learn about studied combat: it&rsquo;s precision damage (i.e., doesn&rsquo;t multiply on a critical hit), it doesn&rsquo;t work on creatures immune to sneak attacks (oozes, elementals, proteans, and incorporeal creatures, unless you have a </span><span class="c8">ghost touch</span><span>&nbsp;weapon), and it won&rsquo;t function unless you can visually confirm a vital spot on the creature (again, any effect that gives an enemy concealment, whether blindness, </span><span class="c8">obscuring mist, deeper darkness, </span><span>etc. will hamper your studied strike, so consider a weapon enchantment like </span><span class="c8">limning</span><span>&nbsp;to deal with this). There&rsquo;s some stuff in here about dealing nonlethal damage, but nonlethal damage is a niche option for the investigator. You can&rsquo;t take Sap Adept or Sap Master, and your weapon proficiencies aren&rsquo;t particularly well-suited to Bludgeoner or Enforcer unless </span><span>you&rsquo;re </span><span class="c1">playing with a morningstar or some nonlethal Sarenite scimitar build. Best just to leave it alone.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">(4) </span><span class="c15 c6">Swift Alchemy:</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">The crafting upgrade is great if you plan to brew potions or create alchemical items, but no one should be super excited about the poison clause. Overall, swift alchemy is another class feature that&rsquo;s ripe for an archetype trade.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c20 c6"></span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c68 c6">(20)</span><span class="c12 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c7">True Inspiration:</span><span>&nbsp;True inspiration amps everything about your inspiration up to 11, and rewards you the more you&rsquo;ve invested in talents that modify or improve your inspiration. I&rsquo;m not entirely clear how true inspiration works with Combat Inspiration + Greater Combat Inspiration: the text in true inspiration says &ldquo;</span><span class="c8">whenever he expends inspiration</span><span>&nbsp;on an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check,&rdquo; which indicates that you can&rsquo;t get free 2d8 added to every attack. You should, however, get the better of two separate 2d8 rolls if you choose to expend one point of inspiration, though, and if you have an </span><span class="c8">inspired</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;weapon, you&rsquo;ll also get to add 4d8 damage to the attack. True inspiration is plenty good as a capstone.</span></p><p class="c0 c2 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c6">Alternate Capstones:</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">Chronicle of Legends</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;was one of the last books published for Pathfinder 1e before the system went dark, and one of the coolest features it added was alternate capstone powers for each and every class. My ratings of these are as follows:</span></p><p class="c0 c2 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><ul class="c34 lst-kix_ensv36a5w0t3-0 start"><li class="c0 c26 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Perfect Body, Flawless Mind:</span><span>&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re heavily invested in combat, push Strength or Dexterity up by 8 and watch the enemies crumble before you; if you&rsquo;re more focused on extracts or skill monkey stuff, boosting Intelligence by 8 will get you there, too. No wrong answers. (Except Charisma. Charisma is the wrong answer.)</span></li><li class="c0 c26 li-bullet-0"><span class="c12 c6">Deadly Study:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Deadly Study is the investigator-exclusive alternate capstone, and on the outside, it&rsquo;s picture-perfect. You just heard me extol the virtues of studied combat for three freaking pages, so why am I not rating this ability blue? Well, if it&rsquo;s just better attack and damage rolls you&rsquo;re after, Perfect Body, Flawless Mind can give you a +8 to your attack stat, which not only boosts attack and damage but also boosts skill checks, possibly initiative rolls and Reflex saves, etc. Deadly Study is fine, as these things go, but it lacks imagination.</span></li><li class="c0 c26 li-bullet-0"><span class="c12 c6">With This Sword:</span><span>&nbsp;Another solid capstone if you have a unique weapon that simply must go down in history as the Greatest Sword Cane Ever To Be Used As A Sword Or Cane. Ultimately, however, With This Sword is reproducible by 20th-level PCs with ease. How hard would it be to find, plunder, steal, or otherwise connive your way into 100,000 gp as a living god? Heck, even loaning out your healing services (</span><span class="c8">heal, restoration, greater neutralize poison, </span><span>etc.) could probably </span><span>earn</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;you that much before long.</span></li><li class="c0 c26 li-bullet-0"><span class="c15 c6">The Boss:</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">By 20th level, The Boss is more likely to be a flavor ability than a combat ability.

I vividly remember being a new player, awash in a sea of archetypes, classes with terms like &ldquo;hybrid,&rdquo; &ldquo;base,&rdquo; and &ldquo;alternate&rdquo; that I didn&rsquo;t understand, and class features with clauses I didn&rsquo;t understand or whose scope I didn&rsquo;t fully grasp. One of the ways to build the &ldquo;which class do I pick?&rdquo; brand of systems mastery is to run comparisons and contrasts between classes. What&rsquo;s different? What&rsquo;s the same? Based on the mechanics in front of you, what can you extrapolate about the role the class is meant to play, both in combat and out? In this section, we&rsquo;ll take a look at how the investigator matches up with three other similar-ish classes (the alchemist, the rogue, and the slayer) and try to draw some conclusions about what investigators are and aren&rsquo;t meant to do.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c36 c5" id="h.x4ar8r654ec5"><span class="c28">Investigator vs. Alchemist</span></h2><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you had to submit the investigator class to a paternity test, the alchemist is definitely the baby daddy. And that&rsquo;s a really good thing! Alchemists are incredibly powerful as Pathfinder classes go, with the archetypes and extracts to be able to fill just about any role that they want, and often at a moment&rsquo;s notice. Thanks to investigators&rsquo; access to alchemist discoveries through their investigator talent class feature and a number of identical class features (poison resistance, alchemy, etc.) there&rsquo;s a lot of thematic and mechanical overlap between the two classes. Let&rsquo;s dig in.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we start with spellcasting, the investigator and alchemist are almost identical. They prepare extracts in the same way, and in the same amount of time; as &#8532; casters, they both receive the same number of extracts per day, with bonus extracts keyed off of Intelligence; they both get access to game-changing spells like </span><span class="c8">alchemical allocation</span><span>&nbsp;that are so powerful that they act like class features. Both classes will try to aggressively expand their formulae books, whether through rote copying of other wizard, &nbsp;alchemist, or investigator formulae books, through magic items like the </span><span class="c8">formula alembic,</span><span>&nbsp;or through feats like Formula Recollection. Having a wide variety of extracts available at all times is the best way to foster the versatility that both these classes are known for. There is one key difference between investigators and alchemists that turns out to be non-trivial, however: </span><span class="c6">investigators cannot use wands of their extracts without a successful UMD check, whereas alchemists can.</span><span>&nbsp;This seemed like an oversight for a while, but no, Paizo eventually clarified their position on the matter. Neither of the classes that use extract casting are counted as spellcasters in the traditional sense, and so the &ldquo;spells&rdquo; that they cast don&rsquo;t actually count as spells known for the purposes of activating spell-completion items (scrolls) and spell trigger items (wands). In order to get back on an even playing field, investigators will almost certainly need to take traits like Pragmatic Activator, talents like Device Talent, or create custom magic items to give them competence bonuses to UMD (a +5 competence bonus will only cost 2500 gp) in order to effectively use their own extracts without &ldquo;casting&rdquo; them by drinking them. This quest to become excellent at UMD yields dividends in other arenas, of course, because UMD will work for wands and scrolls from </span><span class="c8">any</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;class, not just your own. By the time investigators can reliably hit a DC 20 UMD check, they&rsquo;ll be off the races, stealing everyone&rsquo;s spells.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning now to combat prowess, I&rsquo;m sad to report that alchemists definitely have the edge in both ranged and melee arenas. An alchemist&rsquo;s bombs can deal any energy type, debuff like crazy, and inflict massive nova damage to a single target and great splash damage to adjacent targets; it&rsquo;s simply not possible for the investigator class to beat that level of damage in a head-to-head fight. Likewise, the alchemist&rsquo;s ability to foray into the feral mutagen, greater mutagen, and grand mutagen discoveries makes them effortlessly better at melee combat if they&rsquo;ve selected the vivisectionist archetype or other combat-focused archetypes. Investigators, who don&rsquo;t share access to any of the alchemist&rsquo;s bombs or mutagen powers (barring the base mutagen ability, which must be selected as an investigator talent) will struggle to keep up with a well-built alchemist in terms of raw damage output. Investigators will probably be more accurate after studied combat has a few levels to ramp up, and the </span><span class="c8">inspired</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;weapon enchantment can go a decent way toward plumping up your damage numbers; even so, alchemists tend to rule the roost when it comes to insta-gibbing legions of enemies or getting scary-big and trashing bosses. It&rsquo;s okay! Investigators were built for other things.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What other things, you ask? Well, skills would be a good place to start. Alchemists get two fewer skill ranks every level than investigators do, and the inspiration mechanic lets investigators pull immediately ahead of alchemists. If alchemists want to be good at skills, they&rsquo;ve either got to burn resources on the inspiring cognatogen line (and forsake either mutagens or cognatogens, taking penalties to their physical ability scores while they&rsquo;re at it) or they&rsquo;ve got to invest in sub-par discoveries like pheromones or webbed extremities. Thanks to inspiration and the various talents associated with that resource, investigators can excel at skill checks all day. Don&rsquo;t discount the importance of this ability! A good number of combats begin only because someone can&rsquo;t crush the skill check needed to avoid, bluff, spook, or outsmart the enemies in question; an investigator can do so without having to expend any resources, which opens their extracts up for truly important combat applications. Alchemists do well in combat, but need extract support to do well outside of it; investigators tend to do well outside of combat, but need extract support to truly excel in a melee. Both have advantages and disadvantages!</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, if I may speak from a somewhat personal, subjective standpoint, alchemists are a bit </span><span class="c8">flighty.</span><span>&nbsp;They&rsquo;re okay at figuring out mysteries, passing Knowledge checks, connecting the dots&mdash;you can only force an INT-based class to land so far from the tree on that one&mdash;but ultimately there&rsquo;s not a lot of </span><span class="c8">finesse</span><span>&nbsp;to the class. If you&rsquo;re a grenadier, you&rsquo;ll get fast bombs, precise bombs, a couple debuffing variants, and then just spam explosives at every problem until it&rsquo;s a fine powder; if you&rsquo;re a vivisectionist or other melee monster, you&rsquo;ll grab mutagens and as many natural attacks as you can, get big with </span><span class="c8">enlarge person</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;or other polymorph extracts, and hit stuff until it dies. You can get very good at those things as an alchemist, don&rsquo;t mistake me! But some problems require discernment, skill, patience, and perspicacity instead of raw might, and it&rsquo;s there that you ought to accept no substitute for the investigator. Where alchemists madly amputate with a hacksaw, investigators go in with a scalpel and exquisite knowledge of anatomy.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c20 c6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tl;dr version: in spite of many similarities, alchemists need less support from extracts, magic items, etc. to do their thing in combat, but more support to contribute meaningfully outside of combat; for investigators, it&rsquo;s the reverse. Both classes have similar weapon proficiencies, armor proficiencies, and extract casting, making them evenly paired on that front.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c36 c5" id="h.ndid4xtjsrts"><span class="c28">Investigator vs. Rogue</span></h2><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, the rogue: &ldquo;the class so nice they wrote it twice.&rdquo; Rogues are odd ducks in the Pathfinder world, and there&rsquo;s a reason they&rsquo;ve acquired a reputation as being significantly behind the power curve. Paizo got better at writing balanced classes as time went on (one could also argue that that was simply due to power creep); to whit, the rogue, ranger, and monk all got more and more musty as time went. Barring specialized archetypes, monks mostly got superseded by unchained monks and brawlers in later class releases, and rangers&rsquo; souls were split into slayers (non-magical combat monsters) and hunters (&frac34;-BAB, &#8532; casters with powerful animal companions) in order to clarify their purpose. Rogues likewise got their &ldquo;spirits&rdquo; refined and purposes clarified in future books. There was very clearly a split in what the rogue class chassis wanted to be: either the deadly assassin type, striking from the dark to kill enemies in a single well-placed blow, or the consummate skill monkey on the wrong side of the law, able to pick any lock, steal anything not nailed down, and charm the hearts of gentlefolk everywhere. All these identities, as it turned out, were better rendered in other classes, which finally swept the core rogue&rsquo;s leg and sent it tumbling onto the mat. The slayer, of course, is the immediate choice for rogue players who want to be able to actually deal a lot of damage in combat, boasting full BAB, studied target, and even sneak attack dice. The vigilante, meanwhile, can take over many of the rogue&rsquo;s stealth, infiltration, intimidation, and assassination functionalities better than the rogue itself. But as for that skill monkey, well, that role fell to the investigator!</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span>One of the problems, you see, is the way skill ranks </span><span class="c8">work</span><span>&nbsp;in Pathfinder&mdash;an inherent, mechanical limitation of the system. The rogue class tells you that it is the One True Skill Monkey, then points to its 8 + Intelligence skill ranks as evidence supporting this assertion. But surely skills aren&rsquo;t just about breadth, but also depth, right? This was where things started to go off the rails. The problem is that there simply aren&rsquo;t that many class-exclusive ways to get skill bonuses in Pathfinder. Class skills? Yeah, everyone has those. Ranks? Yep, even the 2 + Intelligence classes can still invest in a few skills. Magic items? Everyone has the same wealth by level, so it&rsquo;s definitely possible for a full-BAB martial character to get those </span><span class="c8">eyes of the eagle.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Spells? Rogues never had those to begin with, barring wands or scrolls they could use with UMD. Do you begin to see the problem? With roughly the same level of investment, a rogue who was hyperspecialized in Perception, or Disable Device, or Disguise wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily be any better than a summoner, or a swashbuckler, or even a fighter that was hyperspecialized in those things. Because the rogue didn&rsquo;t add bonuses on top of what skill ranks and magic items could provide, it didn&rsquo;t have a truly legitimate claim to the title of the One True Skill Monkey.</span></p><p class="c0 c2 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span>Other classes, of course, managed to solve this. Bards and skalds have bardic knowledge, inquisitors have stern gaze and monster lore, occultists have magic item skill&mdash;and investigators have inspiration. Although the mechanic is, by its nature, a little more random than the static, passive bonuses available in other classes, I think that&rsquo;s part of what makes it fun! Investigators have lived a whole lot of life, and that shows up in their moments of sudden acuity. Now, if you want to be noticeably </span><span class="c8">better</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;at a single skill, rather than the same amount of better at a lot of skills, you have only to invest in talents that improve your inspiration and skill checks: there&rsquo;s Expanded Inspiration and Underworld Inspiration, of course, then the Amazing Inspiration and Tenacious Inspiration talents; certain archetypes like the questioner or empiricist can take bonuses and stack even more bonuses on. Even by 3rd or 4th level, it will become clear to most investigator players that they&rsquo;re spanking the pants off of their rogue parent where skills are concerned.</span></p><p class="c0 c2 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span>As far as combat and versatility go, the investigator once again has the rogue pretty handily outclassed. Alchemy alone is a </span><span class="c8">huge</span><span>&nbsp;boost to what the investigator is capable of, and can slather on even more skill or combat bonuses when you need them. And man, talk about alchemy making rogue talents like Major Magic look ridiculous! A 1st-level spell, once per day? Gee, golly, mister, you shouldn&rsquo;t have! The other problem that rogues suffer from in the combat arena is what I call &ldquo;Core Monk Syndrome.&rdquo; The basics? You&rsquo;ve got a bunch of damage, but no way to </span><span class="c8">hit anything.</span><span>&nbsp;A 20th-level core monk can launch a flurry of </span><span class="c8">seven</span><span>&nbsp;blows, all with 2d10 damage dice. &ldquo;Whoa,&rdquo; you think, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s going to be </span><span class="c8">insane</span><span>&nbsp;when I get there!&rdquo; Guess what the median AC of a CR 20 creature is, though? 37. Sure, you&rsquo;ll have some bonuses from Strength and your handwraps, but the fact is that 3-5 of those attacks </span><span class="c8">couldn&rsquo;t</span><span>&nbsp;land against an enemy with AC 37 except on a Nat 20. The core rogue suffers from a similar problem: sneak attack dice are sooo enticing, but the rogue has &frac34; BAB and no way to significantly raise their attack bonuses through magic, class features, etc. So there they sit, whiffing on a good 50-75% of their attacks against even-CR creatures. Against enemies with precision damage immunities, all-around vision or improved uncanny dodge, </span><span class="c8">true seeing,</span><span>&nbsp;etc., rogues simply don&rsquo;t have anywhere left to go. Investigators do, though! Thanks to studied combat, a 20th-level investigator&rsquo;s basic attack bonuses will be brought up to +25/+20+15, with </span><span class="c8">haste</span><span>&nbsp;making that +25/+25/+20/+15, whereas rogues will still be stuck at +15/+10/+5. They won&rsquo;t deal the awe-inspiring damage that rogues can on a successful sneak attack, but they&rsquo;ll also be hitting far, far more often than rogues. You can fish for criticals, dole out debuffs through Sickening Offensive and Sapping Offensive, proc weapon enchantments like </span><span class="c8">inspiring,</span><span>&nbsp;etc., but </span><span class="c8">only if you hit.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Except where DR is a concern, I&rsquo;d take a 100% chance to hit for 5 damage over a 5% chance to hit for 100 damage any day of the week.</span></p><p class="c0 c2 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c6">The tl;dr version: core rogues can&rsquo;t really surpass investigators in skills, versatility, </span><span class="c8 c6">or</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;combat. The class was just designed before Paizo really knew how to break free from the restrictions of 3.5e, and other classes swooped in and took over much of its turf. Investigators are one take on &ldquo;rogues as they should have been.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c36 c5" id="h.jii3wdb5v18j"><span class="c28">Investigator vs. Slayer</span></h2><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The investigator-slayer pairing is probably the most dissimilar of any I&rsquo;ll discuss here, which is why it comes last. It&rsquo;s not </span><span class="c8">totally</span><span>&nbsp;dissimilar, though. Remember that both the slayer and the investigator have the core rogue as one of their parent classes, and that commonality shines through in a couple of class features. The most noticeable commonality between them is their &ldquo;studied ____&rdquo; class feature. These are different class features, technically, but they function in much the same way: assuming that both classes can see their target, they can pick out some vital area and continue to strike that vital for more damage. For investigators, studied combat is limited in duration, restricted to only one target, harder to get started in the action economy, and deals entirely precision damage, which doesn&rsquo;t multiply on a crit; for slayers, studied target is unlimited in duration, limited to fewer than five targets, pretty easy to squeeze in as a swift action, and provides normal damage bonuses that </span><span class="c8">do</span><span>&nbsp;multiply on a crit. All in all, I believe that studied target is the mechanically superior class feature, but it does make sense&mdash;slayers are meant to be incredibly lethal in combat, and their mechanics should match that design goal. Against studied targets, however, there&rsquo;s not that great of a difference between a 20th-level investigator and 20th-level slayer; the slayer will be hitting at +25/+20/+15/+10, while the investigator will be hitting at +25/+20/+15. Even with the addition of </span><span class="c8">haste</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;or other common buffs, that&rsquo;s not a world of difference.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slayers do come with other advantages, though. There&rsquo;s sneak attack, which, while weaker than the rogue&rsquo;s version, is far easier to take advantage of with full BAB and studied target. There&rsquo;s the slayer&rsquo;s access to ranger combat styles, which lets them build themselves out to be anything they want to be by scooping feats with onerous prerequisites for free. Investigators, perpetually hamstrung by their slower BAB progression and lack of any bonus feats, won&rsquo;t be able to keep up with the fancy tricks that slayers can pull. Pure power isn&rsquo;t everything, as the investigator proves, and what slayers earn in power they pay for in versatility and out-of-combat utility. Inspiration, skill ranks, and extract casting wipe the floor with anything the slayer chassis is capable of; you&rsquo;ll find the investigator &ldquo;stumped&rdquo; by far fewer situations than a slayer would be.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tl;dr version: slayers more than earn their reputation as one of Pathfinder&rsquo;s most fearsome combat classes, but investigators don&rsquo;t do </span><span class="c8 c6">too</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;badly at keeping up. Where skills and versatility are concerned, slayers lose to investigators like one-legged men at a butt-kicking contest.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c36 c5" id="h.mzv8ek7l7sey"><span class="c28">Some Conclusions</span></h2><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><ul class="c34 lst-kix_wuqknczdyb1h-0 start"><li class="c0 c38 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">Investigators aren&rsquo;t meant to be the frontline combatants: think of them as &ldquo;battlefield helpers.&rdquo;</span><span>&nbsp;Slayers and alchemists are both more powerful in outright combat, but investigators can often take the subtle approach to dismantling enemies: succeeding at Knowledge checks, advising their team, flanking, debuffing with investigator talents, passing off crits with Butterfly&rsquo;s Sting...investigators can hold their own admirably if they need to, certainly far better than core rogues, but they&rsquo;re still meant to be a class that helps </span><span class="c8">other</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;classes shine.

In Pathfinder, specialization is rewarded more than generalization, and investigators don&rsquo;t get a pass on that precept: specializing lets you distribute your stats more tightly, streamlines your feat and talent progression, lets you know which skills and magic items will be important, and logically suggests extracts and archetypes that will complement your playstyle. All Pathfinder PCs need to have some kind of primary combat specialization, and investigators will usually have enough talents and extract support to be able to achieve some kind of secondary specialization. Let&rsquo;s dive in!</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c36 c5" id="h.x18rt4a5wibm"><span class="c7 c57">Melee (STR)</span></h2><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By far the simplest route available to investigators is to ignore the shiny allure of Weapon Finesse or ranged playstyles and just go with a melee Strength build.

Both are acceptable paths, although a one-level fighter dip does quite a bit for STR-based investigators; between the innate proficiencies you&rsquo;ll acquire and the extra feat, you can come out a fair bit ahead.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the melee playstyle goes, STR-based melee investigators will want to wield a longspear unless their racial choice grants them a demonstrably superior option; longspears have a good damage die, decent crit modifier, and most importantly, </span><span class="c8">reach.</span><span>&nbsp;The ability to stand back and poke at someone while a more heavy-duty frontliner takes them on is emblematic of the &ldquo;battlefield helper&rdquo; role that investigators are meant to play, and it&rsquo;s great for keeping yourself alive, threatening ranged attackers or enemy spellcasters, and generally being a simple weapon badass.

The &ldquo;DEXvestigator&rdquo; build (no? How about &ldquo;PoinDEXter&rdquo;?) is a classic playstyle that hearkens back to the likes of Sherlock Holmes and other Victorian-era detectives and duelists, folks who would rather use their quick reflexes and knowledge of human anatomy--rather than brute force--to strike a killing blow. The investigator is suited to this role for one reason, and one reason only: the inspired blade swashbuckler archetype. Normally, getting DEX to both attack and damage takes </span><span class="c8">at least</span><span>&nbsp;three feats (Weapon Focus, Weapon Finesse, and one of the &ldquo;____ Grace&rdquo; feats, usually Fencing Grace for investigators) which, when you don&rsquo;t have any bonus feats, puts rather a dent in your early progression. Most players would agree that you need to be able to fill your combat role before 5th level. Fortunately, the inspired blade swashbuckler gives you both Weapon Finesse and Weapon Focus (Rapier) for free at 1st level, which then lets you grab Fencing Grace at 1st level using your remaining feat. Boom, you&rsquo;re set! With your stat priorities focusing on </span><span class="c6 c7">DEX, INT</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;&gt; </span><span class="c12 c6">CON</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;&gt; </span><span class="c3 c6">STR, WIS, CHA,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;you can hop into some light armor and be all ready to go.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combat calculus is a little different for DEX builds than it is for STR builds. Whereas STR builds will want to use </span><span class="c8">enlarge person</span><span>&nbsp;and their various polymorph extracts to get </span><span class="c8">larger,</span><span>&nbsp;thereby netting STR bonuses, DEX builds will usually want to get </span><span class="c8">smaller.</span><span>&nbsp;Your damage dice will go down in size, which will reduce your damage output ever so slightly, but when most of your damage is coming from your DEX and studied combat, it&rsquo;s actually not that large of a deal--plus, the benefits in Reflex saves, AC, and attack bonuses are well worth the cost. There&rsquo;s really only one weapon for a DEX build: the rapier. With an 18-20/x2 crit modifier, you&rsquo;re more than well-positioned to go fishing for crits, although you won&rsquo;t see huge damage numbers even when you do crit, given that your weapon damage die is small and your studied combat bonuses are precision damage. But scooping up weapon enchantments that grant improved effects on a critical hit (</span><span class="c8">flaming burst, sapping,</span><span>&nbsp;etc.) or the Butterfly&rsquo;s Sting feat can help you turn those crits into better effects. Anyway, DEX builds will usually hit themselves with a </span><span class="c8">reduce person, long arm,</span><span>&nbsp;or </span><span class="c8">shield,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;then use Combat Reflexes to dole out AoOs while they flank with allies, debuff, and generally make nuisances of themselves. Adopting Small or smaller forms with later polymorph extracts can land you some nice special abilities and grant you further DEX bonuses.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><a id="t.761a323661c5fd4bdaa914b6a8378cc64fc0f8a5"></a><a id="t.2"></a><table class="c29"><tbody><tr class="c18"><td class="c17" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span class="c4">Pros</span></p></td><td class="c17" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span class="c4">Cons</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c18"><td class="c17" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c30"><span class="c6 c7">Focused stat distribution.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;DEX builds are as close as investigators come to being single attribute-dependent, getting most of what they need out of DEX and INT alone.</span></p></td><td class="c17" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c30"><span class="c15 c6">Not as much damage.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;DEX builds generally deal less damage than STR builds, and that&rsquo;s okay: hopefully you know what you&rsquo;re signing up for when you go DEX-based.</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c18"><td class="c17" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c30"><span class="c6 c7">Better AC, Reflex saves, and initiative.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Although STR is almost certainly better for dealing damage in combat, DEX is better at just about everything else.

It&rsquo;s no secret that ranged builds are monstrously powerful in Pathfinder, capable of taking full-attack actions when melee allies are still struggling to get in position and chock-full of feats like Clustered Shots, Rapid Shot, and Manyshot that pump your damage to frankly laughable levels. Do I love ranged builds? Yes. Do I think that investigators make good ranged combatants? Absolutely not. The problem, simply put, is feats. Ranged builds must always, </span><span class="c8">always</span><span>&nbsp;surrender at least three feats to become acceptable combatants (Point-Blank Shot, Precise Shot, and Rapid Shot, probably in that order); if they&rsquo;re full-BAB, they&rsquo;ll probably also take Deadly Aim; as time goes on, Point-Blank Master, Improved Precise Shot, Clustered Shots, Hammer the Gap, Manyshot, Snap Shot, Improved Snap Shot, Shot on the Run, Pinpoint Targeting, and more will become staples of the ranged diet. And crossbows or firearms? Forget it! You can&rsquo;t pile on Rapid Reload or Crossbow Mastery when your list of necessary feats is already so long. With &frac34; BAB and absolutely no bonus feats of any kind (not even the option to trade an investigator talent for a combat feat!) investigators struggle to keep up with even the basic requirements of a ranged build--but to add to the pain, investigators are also slapped with the feat taxes Weapon Focus and Ranged Study in order to be able to use their studied combat class feature at range. For those keeping track, that&rsquo;s </span><span class="c8">five</span><span>&nbsp;feats just to do what you absolutely need to, not counting all the upgraded feats that you&rsquo;d sure </span><span class="c8">like</span><span>&nbsp;to have. Now, I did make a ranged investigator build using hinterlander prestige class levels--I think it works pretty well, given the constraints I was under--but overall, this is a really, </span><span class="c8">really</span><span>&nbsp;tough row to hoe as an investigator. If you&rsquo;re still interested, set your attributes at </span><span class="c6 c7">DEX, INT</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;&gt; </span><span class="c15 c6">STR, CON</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;&gt; </span><span class="c3 c6">WIS, CHA</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and we&rsquo;ll take it from there.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming you can get all the feat taxes out of the way, life as a ranged investigator is pretty sweet. Investigators were never meant to withstand much punishment, so staying out of melee range goes a long way toward keeping you alive, and getting more attacks through Rapid Shot multiplies your studied combat damage in a way that I find highly pleasing. Not to mention, you&rsquo;ve got pretty decent support from investigator talents--Castling, Fortified Position, and the Knowledge (Geography) benefit of Chronicler&rsquo;s Insight will go a long way toward keeping you safe from stray hits that drift your way. I think the mathematically optimal way to play a ranged investigator is to shrink down to Small size, whether innately at racial selection or through </span><span class="c8">alter self, infuse self, reduce person,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;or other polymorph extracts. You&rsquo;ll be able to benefit from Castling better, the AC and attack bonuses are nice, and CMD will matter less when you&rsquo;re not in melee.

Like everything in Pathfinder, there are a dizzying number of options available to dedicated trawlers of Archives of Nethys, and as it would be minimally fruitful to review every class Pathfinder has on tap, I typically review all of the core races and a select few other races that suit the class chassis well. If you&rsquo;re not sure about what you&rsquo;re looking for in a potential class pairing, let me give you the run-down:</span></p><p class="c0 c2 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><ul class="c34 lst-kix_v8bd9fvicpzj-0 start"><li class="c0 c38 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Bonuses to Intelligence and Strength/Dexterity.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Strength and Dexterity are the main combat stats for all Pathfinder characters, depending on whether you&rsquo;re playing as a melee bruiser (Strength-based), a finesse fighter (Dexterity-based), or a ranged sniper (Dexterity-based again). Intelligence, meanwhile, determines the investigator&rsquo;s skill ranks&mdash;remember, that little thing you&rsquo;re known for?&mdash;studied combat duration, bonus extracts, inspiration pool, and more. To say that Intelligence is important to what investigators do would be like saying that water and sunlight are important to what plants do, so say and do anything you need to in order to get bonuses there.</span></li><li class="c0 c38 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Bonus feats.</span><span>&nbsp;Investigators are chronically feat-starved, and even though only a few races offer bonus feats (humans and half-elves are the big ones among the core races) you&rsquo;ll still want to </span><span class="c8">seriously</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;consider your feat priorities before selecting a race. Humans start to look mighty enticing when you realize how long it takes to progress two more levels to that next feat.</span></li><li class="c0 c38 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Favored class bonuses.</span><span>&nbsp;FCBs can be powerful upgrades in the right race&rsquo;s hands, or they can be so bad that you&rsquo;ll be running to bonus skill ranks or hit points faster than me to the bathroom after that dodgy Indian buffet downtown. Three abilities stand out among the investigator&rsquo;s FCBs: </span><span class="c6">1)</span><span>&nbsp;Bonus extracts known. You can&rsquo;t be sure how long it will take to run into a decent spell or formula book, so this FCB never, never hurts. </span><span class="c6">2) </span><span>Bonuses on inspiration rolls. Think of it this way: everytime you get a +1 on all inspiration rolls, it&rsquo;s like getting a minimum of 12 free skill ranks (the default number of skills you get free inspiration added to). That&rsquo;s a hard package to beat. </span><span class="c6">3)</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Bonus inspiration. Using inspiration in combat, on saves, etc. can often eat up your resources quickly, and you&rsquo;ll need at least 1 point of inspiration in your pool at all times in order to leverage your free inspiration on certain skill checks. Bonus inspiration goes a long way toward extending your resources throughout the day.</span></li><li class="c0 c38 li-bullet-0"><span class="c12 c6">Vision.</span><span>&nbsp;Of course, the downside to humans is that they suck at navigating in the dark. Unlike other casters, who generally get </span><span class="c8">light</span><span>&nbsp;or </span><span class="c8">dancing lights</span><span>&nbsp;to mitigate this problem, investigators and alchemists simply can&rsquo;t compensate for a lack of darkvision without </span><span class="c8">continual flame, discovery torch,</span><span>&nbsp;or other alchemical support items like sunrods. I consider bonus feats and attribute bonuses bigger racial priorities, but better vision never hurts. Always remember, too, that </span><span class="c8">alter self</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;can polymorph you into a race with darkvision when you really need it.</span></li><li class="c0 c38 li-bullet-0"><span class="c12 c6">Skill bonuses.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;These bonuses have to be evaluated in light of how useful the skill is. Bonuses to Perception, like the elf and half-elf&rsquo;s Keen Senses? Pure gold. Bonuses to Appraise or Handle Animal? Poop on a stick.</span></li></ul><p class="c0 c2 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c42"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c42 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c36 c5" id="h.im81t2k8ie71"><span class="c28">Core Races</span></h2><p class="c0 c2 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><h3 class="c0 c5" id="h.vgqpkhzcyjyp"><span class="c44 c15">Dwarf</span></h3><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwarves are straight-up </span><span class="c8">stanky</span><span>&nbsp;as base investigators.

For some reason, there&rsquo;s a bevy of traits that swap out normally Wisdom- or Charisma-based skills for Intelligence, and if you&rsquo;re guessing that investigators want to get their hands on those traits, you&rsquo;d be guessing correctly. Investigators typically dump Charisma and leave Wisdom at 10, which means we want our Intelligence to be fueling as many skills and class functions as possible. New players, please note that you can only select one trait from each trait category unless you&rsquo;ve selected an appropriate Exemplar trait.</span></p><p class="c0 c2 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c36 c5 c10" id="h.fptjgn300gx6"><span class="c28">Combat Traits</span></h2><p class="c0 c2 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Accelerated Drinker:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Investigators and alchemists do a lot of potion drinking, so it only stands to reason that you might want to be able to consume them as fast as possible. This is definitely a top-tier trait, and certainly better than Potion Glutton after its errata.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Reactionary:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;+2 to initiative is powerful and useful throughout your adventuring career.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Resilient:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Half of Great Fortitude, sitting here for the taking! Your Fortitude save isn&rsquo;t great, after all.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Arodenite Sword Training:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;The longsword is a good weapon, with a solid damage die and a decent crit range. If you don&rsquo;t want to use a rapier or sword cane and your race doesn&rsquo;t grant any novel proficiencies, this is a solid way to expand your options.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Bloody-Minded:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Initiative bonuses are eternally useful, and Intimidate is certainly something that investigators can do well, so long as they have Bruising Intellect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Careful Combatant:</span><span>&nbsp;Adding another square of AoO-free movement to the </span><span>withdraw</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;action lets you escape from enemies with reach weapons or 10 feet of natural reach. Can be very good for a class that&rsquo;s not meant to withstand harsh punishment in melee range.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Dirty Trickster:</span><span>&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re going to choose any combat maneuver to specialize in, it should </span><span>be dirty</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;trick. It&rsquo;s versatile, powerful, and doesn&rsquo;t depend on the number of legs your enemy has. Problem with all maneuvers is that they need you to take Combat Expertise before you can get to the Improved [Maneuver] feat. Dirty Trickster neatly eliminates that requirement, which saves you a feat tax and gets you to your goal faster. Plus a little bonus! Nice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Hard to Kill:</span><span>&nbsp;We obviously don&rsquo;t want you going unconscious very often, but if you do, your Constitution score isn&rsquo;t likely to be high enough to stabilize yourself efficiently. Hard to Kill goes a long way toward solving that problem.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Killer:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span><span>Most investigators have the ability to crit fish, especially investigators who use rapiers on the regular. Killer isn&rsquo;t an </span><span class="c8">enormous </span><span class="c1">damage bonus when you confirm a crit, but enough that this is a solidly good trait.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Natural Flyer:</span><span>&nbsp;Investigators can expect to fly quite a bit with </span><span class="c8">fly</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;on their class list, but Fly isn&rsquo;t a class skill! Thankfully, there&rsquo;s Natural Flyer.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Ambush Training:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Lamplighters in particular might be interested in Ambush Training, which increases their initiative checks to even more ridiculous levels and grants them a little bonus damage, while they&rsquo;re at it. It&rsquo;s not quite as powerful as Reactionary, but it&rsquo;s also less cheesy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Guerrilla Tactics:</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span>Strictly better than Reactionary if you&rsquo;re in a forest, for example in an </span><span class="c8 c6 c7">Ironfang Invasion</span><span class="c6 c7">&nbsp;campaign.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Surprise Weapon:</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">Criminally </span><span>good for </span><span class="c6 c7">gravediggers,</span><span>&nbsp;who can use shovels and gravedigger&rsquo;s tools as improvised weapons at no penalty. If you&rsquo;re going Shikigami Style (again, see the Shovel Knight build below) then this is a free +2 on attack rolls </span><span class="c8">all the time.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c6">Helpful:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Battlefield Disciple is better.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c36 c5" id="h.p2iqynoketwi"><span class="c28">Faith Traits</span></h2><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Called:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Reroll a Nat 1 once per day.

Now, investigators don&rsquo;t have as many luck bonuses available as other classes, especially divine classes that get spells like </span><span class="c8">divine favor,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;but you can easily massage a few luck bonuses from other places, like the half-orc&rsquo;s Sacred Tattoo alternate racial trait.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Focused Disciple:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;The worst effects you can ever be subjected to! Nice to have the bonus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Oathbound:</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Similar to Focused Disciple, and similarly good.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Totemist:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Whoa! Totemist is a huge, flexible competence bonus to attacks, saves, skill checks...you can only use it 1/day, but how many times will a trait grant you a +10 bonus on something at 20th level?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Imperfect Recall:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Knowledge checks made &ldquo;while you are in danger or distracted&rdquo; will be most monster identification checks. You could do way worse than a 1/day +3 to those skills.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Indomitable Faith:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">I prefer Disdainful Defender or Focused Disciple, but Indomitable Faith is great, too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Schooled Inquisitor:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Undead and outsiders are frequent enemies in most campaigns; a +2 bonus to identify them is nothing to sneeze at.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Meditative Rest:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;An interesting trait to consider if your GM likes to harass you while you sleep to prevent you from regaining spell slots. It&rsquo;s kinda mean, but I&rsquo;ve done it before when I feel like a party is steamrolling content a bit too easily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Patient Calm:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Perhaps for taking 12 on Craft (Alchemy) checks?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Sacred Touch:</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Most investigators will be able to hit a DC 15 Heal check pretty easily. If you&rsquo;re feeling like writing off those checks, though, Sacred Touch is a great way to do it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Unnatural Presence:</span><span>&nbsp;This trait will be</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;mandatory</span><span>&nbsp;for </span><span class="c6 c7">demoralize builds,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;who will welcome the opportunity to expand their demoralize attempts to previously unshakable foes.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c36 c5" id="h.pxtbq0yy9591"><span class="c28">Magic Traits</span></h2><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Acadamae Neophyte:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;So&hellip;a permanent +5 to Knowledge (Planes), perhaps the most useful of all Knowledge skills? Yes, please.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Enduring Mutagen:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Any investigator can benefit from the Mutagen discovery; Enduring Mutagen makes it last longer, which is always, always good.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Magical Knack:</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">The perennially useful trait for multiclassed Pathfinder PCs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Magical Lineage:</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c31"><a class="c14" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://paizo.com/threads/rzs2q42l?Alchemists-Metamagic&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117394617000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1PizWI6AsS3y6AHmMOeFTB">Magical Lineage&mdash;most unfortunately&mdash;does not apply to extracts,</a></span><span>&nbsp;which are not counted as spells for many purposes, despite the similarities. </span><span class="c8">However,</span><span>&nbsp;metamagic feats </span><span class="c8">can</span><span>&nbsp;be applied to potions, so if you want to take Brew Potion and Extend Spell (by far the best, most universally applicable metamagic feat for investigators) you can enjoy </span><span class="c8">free Extend Spell</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;on your most-crafted potion. Rocks my world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Pragmatic Activator:</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Woo! Intelligence to UMD instead of Charisma is probably the best of all the Magic traits. UMD is incredibly useful, and depending on how hard you dumped Charisma, this could easily equate to a +10 bonus by the end of your career. If you&rsquo;ve got one trait and don&rsquo;t know what to do with the other, make it this one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Precise Treatment:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Precise Treatment does for Heal what Pragmatic Activator does for UMD. If you&rsquo;re going for a non-magical healing build (see the Herr Doktor build below) you&rsquo;ll get Precise Treatment and love it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Transmuter of Korada:</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Transmutation spells are an investigator&rsquo;s bread and butter; doubling the length of a stat-boosting transmutation spell and getting a permanent +1 CL is bueno, bueno, bueno.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Cross-Knowledge:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">A 1/day CL boost for one of your extracts. Could do worse.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Less Effort:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Transmutation and abjuration spells are, like, 90% of what an investigator does. So sure, take a permanent +2 CL to your most commonly cast spell!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Meticulous Concoction:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Longer duration on an extract, 1/day. Good.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Unscathed:</span><span>&nbsp;Tieflings, aasimar, and other races that get access to multiple energy resistance types will positively love Unscathed. Now you can literally stand in a bonfire and take no damage at all. Check with your GM about how they interpret this trait in relation to spells like </span><span class="c8">resist energy;</span><span>&nbsp;if they allow it for those purposes, increase its rating to </span><span class="c32 c6 c7">blue.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Unstable Mutagen:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a gamble, but there can be good effects in store for you if you beat the odds.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Alchemical Adept:</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span>Great for </span><span class="c32 c6 c7">crafting builds.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Perfectionist&rsquo;s Brew:</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span>And also great for </span><span class="c6 c7">crafting builds.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c5 c36" id="h.3zr2xpqwd521"><span class="c28">Social Traits</span></h2><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Adopted:</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Adopted is a little cheesy, in my opinion, but there&rsquo;s no denying that being able to pick a Race trait at will is super, super powerful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Arodenite Historian:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;All of an investigator&rsquo;s Knowledge skills are likely to be equally high, so Arodenite Historian is kinda like a free reroll on every Arcana, History, and Religion check you ever roll.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Bruising Intellect:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Intelligence instead of Charisma to determine your Intimidate bonus singlehandedly makes investigator demoralize builds possible. You&rsquo;ll need this if you want to intimidate in combat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Clever Wordplay:</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span>Student of Philosophy will beat out Clever Wordplay in </span><span class="c8">most</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;social situations, but Clever Wordplay still pulls ahead if you&rsquo;re intending to feint in combat (in which case, select Bluff), gather information (using Diplomacy), or infiltrate enemy organizations (using Disguise) often.

What if I told you I&rsquo;d figured out how to do that with Mock Gladiator?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Monster Scholar:</span><span>&nbsp;Like Acadamae Neophyte, but for Arcana, Dungeoneering, </span><span class="c8">or</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Nature!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Rich Parents:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Even though 900 gp is unlikely to be significant in the long-term, a cash infusion that large at the start of your career is just what you need to get going.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Student of Philosophy:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Student of Philosophy is the Social trait that most investigators will want&mdash;Diplomacy and Bluff are the most universal face skills.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Ancestral Armor:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Free masterwork armor?

That&rsquo;s problematic, however, as you can only have on Social trait. You could try to pick...or you could take this Exemplar trait, which gives you a stacking bonus depending on the number of Social traits you have, and allows you to pick more than one Social trait using the Additional Traits feat. If you really, really want to turn your investigator into a feinting, demoralizing, bluffing, persuading master, you&rsquo;ll need to invest in Charming Smile, Cunning Soul. I&rsquo;m not entirely convinced that it&rsquo;s worth it, though, as investigators are better off with the Skill Focus (Linguistics) + Orator combo if they want to act as the party face.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c36 c5" id="h.6dx46pja8wzm"><span class="c28">Race Traits</span></h2><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather than rate all racial traits, I&rsquo;ve only rated racial traits from races that make particularly good investigators.

If you&rsquo;ve never played an alchemist or investigator before, you may wish to revisit the rules text in the Class Chassis section, as there are important elements that distinguish extracts from other kinds of casting that the player must understand before jumping in headlong. I would always advise that investigators try to leave a few extract slots when preparing their spells for the day, as you never know when you&rsquo;ll need to bring up a niche extract that exactly fits the situation your team is in.</span></p><p class="c0 c2 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c36 c5" id="h.ooh9fub42ig6"><span class="c28">1st-Level Extracts</span></h2><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c35 c6">Tears to Wine:</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span>At 10 minutes/level, </span><span class="c8">tears to wine</span><span>&nbsp;is easily the best 1st-level skill buff you have. </span><span class="c8">Heightened awareness</span><span>&nbsp;will beat it out for a time due to the latter&rsquo;s initiative bonus, but once you reach CL 9, you should have </span><span class="c8">tears to wine</span><span>&nbsp;running more or less constantly. Your Knowledge, Spellcraft, Perception, and Sense Motive checks will thank you for it. Also noteworthy as a high-CL potion, paired with </span><span class="c8">alchemical allocation.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;It would stink to use a 2nd-level extract on a 1st-level spell, but it may be worth it to you to get the upgraded bonuses sooner.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Coin Shot:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span><span>Investigators aren&rsquo;t particularly good at ranged combat, but </span><span class="c8">coin shot</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;gives you a quick and easy effect that targets touch AC, hits for surprisingly decent damage, and overcomes several forms of DR.

You Want This.&trade; The duration is a little too short to make it a good </span><span class="c8">alchemical allocation</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;pairing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Cure Moderate Wounds:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Best used at the end of an adventuring day if you have leftover extracts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Focused Scrutiny:</span><span>&nbsp;Huge, untyped bonuses and an excellent duration make </span><span class="c8">focused scrutiny</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;a prime choice for any social interaction. Unfortunately not eligible for potions due to its personal range.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Investigative Mind:</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">Acute senses, focused scrutiny, investigative mind...</span><span>2nd-level is a great level for skill buffs. This spell could conceivably be active for large swaths of time, and only gets better as you level up. Remember: if you ever fail a Knowledge check as an investigator, I haven&rsquo;t been doing my job correctly. As with </span><span class="c8">focused scrutiny,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;not eligible for potion-making.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Invisibility:</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span>You don&rsquo;t need me to explain why </span><span class="c8">invisibility</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is good, right?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Resist Energy:</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span>Powerful, versatile, and long-lasting, </span><span class="c8">resist energy</span><span>&nbsp;is everything that a defensive extract should be. I prefer it to </span><span class="c8">protection from energy</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;by a wide margin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Restoration, Lesser:</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span>I prefer a wand of </span><span class="c8">lesser restoration,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;but it&rsquo;s not bad to know it as an extract, either. Nice that there&rsquo;s no material component.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">See Invisibility:</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Very, very necessary for casters and many creatures in the bestiaries.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Skinsend:</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span>You don&rsquo;t want to use this yourself, but it&rsquo;s instant death to any creature who gets injected with an Infusion of </span><span class="c8">skinsend.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;No save, no SR. Brutal.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Ablative Barrier:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span><span>I used to poo-poo </span><span class="c8">ablative barrier,</span><span>&nbsp;but it actually doubles the effectiveness of your healing by converting lethal damage to nonlethal damage, which is healed in parallel with lethal damage. Makes for a very good </span><span class="c8 c6 c7">alchemical allocation</span><span class="c6 c7">&nbsp;candidate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Adhesive Blood:</span><span>&nbsp;Against enemies wielding manufactured weapons, </span><span class="c8">adhesive blood</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;can cause valuable turns to be wasted as foes attempt to pry their swords away from your gluey hide.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Alter Self:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Perpetually useful for picking up new vision modes, movement modes, etc. Keep in mind that this isn&rsquo;t an Illusion effect, so there&rsquo;s no Will save to disbelieve.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Animal Aspect:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">Animal aspect</span><span>&nbsp;is a good spell, but remember that many of the effects here are reproducible at lower spell levels. Raptor can be duplicated by </span><span class="c8">expeditious retreat,</span><span>&nbsp;Frog by </span><span class="c8">jump,</span><span>&nbsp;Monkey and Tree Lizard by </span><span class="c8">monkey fish</span><span>, Otter by </span><span class="c8">touch of the sea...</span><span>the real strength of </span><span class="c8">animal aspect</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is that it can be any of those spells, depending on what you need, but you have better options if you&rsquo;re given prep time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Barkskin:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span><span>Unlike </span><span class="c8">shield,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">barkskin</span><span>&nbsp;will be duplicated by an </span><span class="c8">amulet of natural armor</span><span>&nbsp;at some point. The spell can hit a +5 bonus much faster than an amulet can, however, which is why you&rsquo;ll keep </span><span class="c8">barkskin</span><span>&nbsp;in rotation for quite a while. High-CL potions of </span><span class="c8">barkskin</span><span>&nbsp;are also the </span><span class="c6 c7">classic </span><span class="c8 c6 c7">alchemical allocation </span><span class="c6 c7">spell.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Bear&rsquo;s Endurance:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span><span>Whether you&rsquo;re Strength- or Dexterity-based for damage, it&rsquo;s likely that you won&rsquo;t have enough money to buy a dual-attribute physical belt, which means that Constitution is open for business with </span><span class="c8">bear&rsquo;s endurance.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Better Fortitude saves and more HP never hurt anyone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Blistering Invective:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span><span>I&rsquo;m struggling to think how </span><span class="c8">blistering invective</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;would work in extract form, but hey, it&rsquo;s a magical pretend game. This spell&mdash;in addition to being wicked cool&mdash;deals respectable damage, demoralizes, and has the potential to light enemies on fire. It&rsquo;s one of your few AoE damage spells, so enjoy it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Blur:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span><span>Miss chance spells like </span><span class="c8">blur</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c8">displacement</span><span>&nbsp;scale much better into the endgame, because they ignore enemies&rsquo; to-hit bonuses. </span><span class="c8">Blur </span><span class="c1">is an important component of early-game defense, so learn it when you can.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Darkvision:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">Darkvision</span><span>&nbsp;isn&rsquo;t as versatile as </span><span class="c8">alter self,</span><span>&nbsp;but it does last much longer. You&rsquo;ll know whether you need this extract or not. If you have the Infusion talent, this can be a phenomenal potion to pass out to others with </span><span class="c8">alchemical allocation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Fire Breath:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">Firebelly</span><span>&nbsp;couldn&rsquo;t quite get there, but </span><span class="c8">fire breath </span><span class="c1">can. This is your swarm-killer, and a decent means of dealing some damage to tightly packed enemies. With a Reflex save for half, SR, and no scaling damage, though, it won&rsquo;t stick with you beyond the early to middle levels.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Hidden Blades:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span><span>As a &frac34;-BAB class, investigators might consider feinting as a useful strategy to improve their chances to hit. </span><span class="c8">Hidden blades </span><span class="c1">makes your feints and concealed weapons that much more deadly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Invigorating Poison:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span><span>The utility of </span><span class="c8">invigorating poison</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is predicated on you having it prepared and recognizing an enemy as likely to use poison. That being said, it&rsquo;s hilarious to take what should be a debuff and turn it into a buff!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Ironskin:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span><span>It&rsquo;s better than </span><span class="c8">barkskin,</span><span>&nbsp;but also ten times shorter in duration. Your call, </span><span class="c8">muchacha.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Owl&rsquo;s Wisdom:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span><span>Much like Constitution for </span><span class="c8">bear&rsquo;s endurance,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Wisdom is the overlooked hero of the investigator&rsquo;s mental attributes. Better Will save, better Perception and Sense Motive checks...you can get some decent benefits here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Spider Climb:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">Monkey fish</span><span>&nbsp;can probably fit most of your adventuring needs, but when you need </span><span class="c8">spider climb,</span><span>&nbsp;you really need it. It&rsquo;ll get outclassed soon by </span><span class="c8">fly</span><span>, but it also makes a pretty good </span><span class="c8">alchemical allocation</span><span>&nbsp;candidate, whereas </span><span class="c8">fly</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;generally does not.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Undetectable Alignment:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">A must-have for any intrigue game.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Vine Strike:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Entangled is actually quite a good condition to go handing out. Plus, Reflex saves tend to be pretty weak. I&rsquo;d say you should pick up the Chaos Reigns conduit feat and get to work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Vomit Swarm:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Sometimes a swarm will do better work than you could, and using your standard action every round will be worth it. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Aid:</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">A decent combat buff, but nothing gamechanging.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Air Step:</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Better and better as you add ranks to Fly. A prime candidate for Numerical Alchemy if you ever need to ignore difficult terrain in an encounter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Aldori Alacrity:</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span>I think I&rsquo;d prefer </span><span class="c8">expeditious retreat</span><span>&nbsp;in most circumstances, but </span><span class="c8">aldori alacrity</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is decent enough at what it does.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Aram Zey&rsquo;s Focus:</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">A primo spell for disabling traps, but I would try to boost this skill high enough on your own that you don&rsquo;t need it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Blood Armor:</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span>It stinks that you need to take damage in order to </span><span>proc the effect</span><span>; it also stinks that </span><span class="c8">blood armor</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;gets less effective as you get better armor. Useful in early levels, though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Blood Transcription:</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span>We-ell, it&rsquo;s powerful, but also has the [evil] tag. Using this spell is an evil act, and your GM may rule that such an act has consequences. Evil investigators can rejoice, though, because it&rsquo;s a </span><span class="c6 c7">great spell.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Bullet Shield:</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Is the improved deflection bonus worth the niche applications? Whip it up if you know you&rsquo;re going to be facing a ranged combatant. Otherwise, let it go.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Bull&rsquo;s Strength:</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span>As an enhancement bonus, you can&rsquo;t use both </span><span class="c8">bull&rsquo;s strength</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and a physical attribute belt. Strength-based investigators will want the latter full-time; Dexterity-based investigators won&rsquo;t care about Strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Cat&rsquo;s Grace:</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span>As with </span><span class="c8">bull&rsquo;s strength, </span><span class="c1">Strength-based investigators won&rsquo;t particularly care, while Dexterity-based investigators will have a physical stat belt.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Certain Grip:</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">You don&rsquo;t run across many effects that grant outright immunity to a combat maneuver. Maybe think about it if your GM is particularly disarm-happy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Delay Disease / Poison:</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span>Both of these spells are fairly lackluster as extracts, but </span><span class="c8 c6 c7">awesome</span><span class="c6 c7">&nbsp;as </span><span class="c8 c6 c7">alchemical allocation</span><span class="c6 c7">&nbsp;potions.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Basically disease/poison immunity as 2nd-level spells.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Detect Thoughts:</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">I&rsquo;d sooner use the Empathy investigator talent for this effect, but it&rsquo;s still not bad.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Dongun Shaper&rsquo;s Touch:</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span>Hard to know what to do with this one. </span><span class="c8">Gloves of shaping</span><span>&nbsp;are the way you&rsquo;d normally achieve this effect, but </span><span class="c8">dongun shaper&rsquo;s touch</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;can&rsquo;t do things quite that flexibly. On balance, I think its uses will be limited&mdash;non-magical and unattended are hard restrictions to meet as levels go by.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Enchantment Sight:</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span>This spell has always been a strong candidate for </span><span class="c8">permanency</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;on my PCs, as it&rsquo;s very helpful to know when someone has been hit with an enchantment spell. Best used for spot checks until you can get it made permanent, though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Enshroud Thoughts:</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">I suppose if you&rsquo;re playing an intrigue-heavy game, maybe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Extreme Flexibility:</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span>It&rsquo;s a poor man&rsquo;s </span><span class="c8">freedom of movement</span><span class="c1">. Not a bad idea to have one handy in earlier levels.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">False Age:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Half-elf only. I&rsquo;m sure there are shenanigans to be had here from boosting your mental scores on non-adventuring days and physical scores on adventuring days. Seems like a lot of work, though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">False Life:</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span>It&rsquo;s rather a lot of work to go through for a limited benefit. I&rsquo;d sooner use </span><span class="c8">ablative barrier.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Fire&rsquo;s Friend:</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Goblin only. This is actually a pretty decent disincentive to attack you, and definitely a disincentive to grapple you. I like it!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Fox&rsquo;s Cunning:</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s great for investigators early on, but quickly loses utility once you can achieve a +4 enhancement bonus to Intelligence through your headband slot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Ghostly Disguise:</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">I could maybe think of some intrigue uses for this spell.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Heroic Fortune:</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span>Assuming you use hero points and can stomach the expensive material component, </span><span class="c8">heroic fortune</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;gives you good things.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Invisibility Bubble:</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">You&rsquo;ll know when it&rsquo;s called for.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Pouncing Fury:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">Pouncing fury</span><span>&nbsp;won&rsquo;t be applicable to most weapon builds, but </span><span class="c6 c7">ratfolk with Sharp Claw</span><span>&nbsp;can use it to turn charges into dual attacks that deal full studied combat damage. A fantastic surprise round opener for them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Tattoo Potion:</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">There are lots of possibilities here, but it&rsquo;s certainly not an &ldquo;everyday&rdquo; kind of extract.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Twisted Innards:</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span>It&rsquo;s not strictly bad, but I think I&rsquo;d prefer to use </span><span class="c8">ironskin</span><span>&nbsp;and get a 100% certain crit negation. It&rsquo;s not like either spell lasts long enough to protect you through multiple fights.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c6">Ancestral Regression:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;How many friendly Drow have you met in your travels?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c6">Ant Haul, Communal:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span>Probably better at this point to just give an Infusion of </span><span class="c8">ant haul</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;to your strongest party member.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c6">Beloved of the Forge:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span>Use </span><span class="c8">crafter&rsquo;s fortune</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;for crafting. The other bonuses are inconsequential.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c6">Bestow Weapon Proficiency:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Just use weapons you&rsquo;re proficient with, dammit!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c6">Blood Blaze:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Totally metal, and totally weak.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c6">Catatonia:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Okay, Juliet, we get it, you&rsquo;re not really dead.

If you have a face skill that&rsquo;s still using Charisma, I haven&rsquo;t been doing my job correctly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c6">Elemental Touch:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Weeeak.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c6">Empower Holy Water:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s more convenient just to attack undead and kill them normally.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c6">Extreme Buoyancy:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span>Drink a </span><span class="c8">touch of the sea</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and swim up that way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c6">Fiery Runes:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Weak, weak damage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c6">Fire Sneeze:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Goblin only.

Best used when you know you&rsquo;re going up against a really tough fight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Penumbral Disguise:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">A huge, long-lasting buff to Stealth and Disguise.

Definitely a disincentive to attack an investigator.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Undead Anatomy I:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span><span>There aren&rsquo;t any abilities here you couldn&rsquo;t get through </span><span class="c8">alter self,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;but you never know when being undead will come in handy.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Absorbing Touch:</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s an alchemist/investigator-only extract, which makes me think that it should be great for us; there are certainly some uses, true, like sneaking nonmagical weapons into weaponless events, carrying sensitive documents to the right people, etc., but overall it&rsquo;s pretty niche.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Age Resistance, Lesser:</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span>Age is a funny thing in Pathfinder. There aren&rsquo;t </span><span class="c8">that</span><span>&nbsp;many ways to boost your mental stats beyond point buy, new attribute points that you gain as you level up, mental stat headbands, magical stat tomes...and getting older. The </span><span class="c8">age resistance</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;suite represents a pretty clear trade-off: in exchange for one of your daily extract slots (3rd, 4th, or 5th-level) you can get all the benefits of advancing age with none of the penalties. Being venerable, for example, can give you +3 Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, at the expense of -6 Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution. If you can lose those penalties, that&rsquo;s a huge deal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Animal Aspect, Greater:</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span>I don&rsquo;t think that any of the benefits in the second tier of </span><span class="c8">animal aspect</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;merit the higher-level spell slot. You can still gain many of these effects with 1st-level extracts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Burrow:</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span>Novel movement modes are always worth taking note of, but </span><span class="c8">burrow</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;isn&rsquo;t great at what it does, being both slow and risky.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Countless Eyes:</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Okay, gross. But also potentially worth it at hours/level.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Create Drug:</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Useful for bribes and the like.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Darkvault:</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span>You drink the spell, but it must be cast on an area? Not sure how that works.

Investigators are incredibly dependent on opponents not having concealment: if you can&rsquo;t pick out a vital spot visually, you might as well be playing a core rogue, for all the damage you&rsquo;ll do.

Talents are generally dedicated to improving your use of inspiration and skills (see Inspiration Enhancers), your combat efficacy from studied combat or studied strike (see Studied Combat Enhancers), miscellaneous other skill or extract casting buffs (see Miscellaneous Talents), or talents/discoveries that are ripped straight from the pages of the rogue and alchemist classes. In general, talents are very powerful, usually quite a bit more powerful than feats; any archetype that trades away a large number of investigator talents will be required to bring something truly special to the table, and failing that litmus test is a great way to suss out subpar archetypes. Always remember that the Extra Investigator Talent is available to help you ease the crunch&mdash;it&rsquo;s a great option for double-digit levels when your immediate combat needs have been taken care of and you want to revisit some of the options from your base class. Alright! Let&rsquo;s hit it!</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c36 c5" id="h.w4d5rc29s9xm"><span class="c28">Inspiration Enhancers</span></h2><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h3 class="c0 c5" id="h.217jnzwgtn1v"><span class="c37">3rd Level</span></h3><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Atheist Inspiration:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Divine Defiance is already a good feat, granting you +2 vs. saves against divine spells or SLAs; Atheist Inspiration is even better, granting you (on average) +3.5 vs. those same rolls and qualifying you for skill buff feats like Divine Denouncer or primo magehunting feats like Focused Disbelief. Definitely up there if you want to capitalize on your already-strong Will save.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Expanded Inspiration:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Expanded Inspiration could easily hit a blue rating just for the Perception buff; add useful social skills like Diplomacy and Sense Motive, and it does even better for itself. Heal and Profession will be the most niche uses of Expanded Inspiration, but can still do good work if you need to treat diseases, stabilize someone on the fly, make various Profession checks untrained, etc.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Device Talent:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Wands of spells that aren&rsquo;t on your class list are fair game after you can reliably hit a 20 on a Use Magic Device check. Even if you&rsquo;re an Empiricist using your Intelligence modifier instead of Charisma on UMD checks, it can still be a long march to a 20. Device Talent makes that much, much easier, although investigator talents are limited enough that you might not be able to find room for it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Underworld Inspiration:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;The skills included in Underworld Inspiration aren&rsquo;t as universally useful as those in Expanded Inspiration. Still, Underworld Inspiration is a necessary adjunct to any build that attempts to be the world&rsquo;s best skill monkey.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Inspired Alertness:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Mostly present on your talent list to ensure that you don&rsquo;t get splattered in surprise rounds. It&rsquo;s okay; there are much more pressing priorities among your talents, however.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Inspired Intelligence:</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Base investigators can already add their inspiration dice to these skills&mdash;this talent is here for investigator archetypes that traded away that particular ability.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c6">Inspired Intimidator:</span><span>&nbsp;Investigators </span><span class="c8">can</span><span>&nbsp;be good at Intimidation with the Bruising Intellect trait, Underworld Inspiration talent, Pathfinder Unchained Intimidate Skill Unlock feat, and a few other helping hands. Inspired Intimidator only increases the </span><span class="c8">duration</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;of the shaken condition, however, which makes it worthless for escalating fear conditions. You shouldn&rsquo;t trade a point of inspiration for one extra round of the shaken condition.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c6">Unconventional Inspiration:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Investigators can get free inspiration on Knowledges, Linguistics, and Spellcraft checks (Base, or Inspired Intelligence), on UMD checks (Device Talent), on Perception, Diplomacy, Sense Motive, Heal, and Profession checks (Expanded Inspiration), and on Bluff, Disable Device, Disguise, Intimidate, and Sleight of Hand checks (Underworld Inspiration). That leaves Acrobatics, Appraise, Climb, Craft, Escape Artist, Fly, Handle Animal, Perform, Ride, Stealth, Survival, and Swim checks up for grabs from Unconventional Inspiration. The best argument I could make is for Acrobatics, Escape Artist, and Stealth, but even so, talents are precious resources; the juice isn&rsquo;t worth the squeeze here.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h3 class="c0 c5" id="h.j92jluqvb3re"><span class="c37">5th Level</span></h3><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Empathy:</span><span>&nbsp;As a 2nd-level spell, </span><span class="c8">detect thoughts</span><span>&nbsp;quickly becomes trivially easy for targets with decent Will saves to resist. Empathy gives you the ability to scale the save DC with your investigator level, however, making your mental intrusions that much more difficult to shake off. </span><span class="c6 c7">Pair Empathy with Expanded Inspiration,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and there should be no earthly reason why anyone pulls the wool over your eyes ever again. Empathy is a top-shelf ability for any intrigue or investigation scenario.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h3 class="c0 c5" id="h.hbykcmne0i1l"><span class="c37">7th Level</span></h3><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Inspirational Expertise:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Inspirational Expertise has several notable flaws, including limited range, short duration, susceptibility to the deafened condition, and poor control over when the ability can be activated. Nevertheless, +4 is a large bonus, easily capable of decimating an enemy boss if your team is properly positioned for sneak attacks, full-attack actions, alchemist bomb fusillades, etc.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Amazing Inspiration:</span><span>&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re like me, you get unreasonably excited by effects that increase your die size, without pausing to consider how the mathematical averages shake out. Amazing Inspiration is effectively a +1 to any check that you use inspiration on. That could be an excellent effect, if you&rsquo;ve invested heavily in Expanded or Underworld Inspiration, Combat Inspiration, etc., or an underwhelming effect if you stuck with what the base investigator was capable of. See my </span><span class="c31"><a class="c14" href="#h.btc6jbtt5iwp">Sidebar: Tenacious Inspiration</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;section for more info about Amazing Inspiration.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h3 class="c0 c5" id="h.rol5d5p07i9m"><span class="c37">9th Level</span></h3><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c35 c6">Combat Inspiration:</span><span>&nbsp;If you </span><span class="c8">ever</span><span>&nbsp;intend to use inspiration during combat, there&rsquo;s no reason to avoid Combat Inspiration. It doubles your inspiration economy; it paves the way for Greater Combat Inspiration, the worthiest of capstone talents; it makes your &frac34;-BAB chassis that much more effective in encounters. Take it, and especially take it with the </span><span class="c8">inspired</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;weapon enchantment for even more damage.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h3 class="c0 c5" id="h.7t026j9c1a17"><span class="c37">11th Level</span></h3><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Eidetic Recollection:</span><span>&nbsp;Knowledge checks can be the difference between life or death when identifying monster strengths or weaknesses in combat. Even without that utility, Knowledge checks often help players piece together in-game mysteries, advance the plot, and accomplish other useful narrative purposes. Eidetic Recollection is therefore </span><span class="c8">extraordinarily</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;useful for skill monkeys.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c6">Sustained Inspirational Expertise:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Inspirational Expertise is already only good&mdash;not great&mdash;so you can imagine that I&rsquo;m not enthused about spending additional inspiration every turn for a steadily declining benefit. You might be able to get away with this talent if you&rsquo;ve invested in some means of streamlining your inspiration use on other checks; if you haven&rsquo;t done that, Sustained Inspirational Expertise is likely to suck you dry with few perceptible effects.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h3 class="c0 c5" id="h.29eekadim40e"><span class="c37">13th Level</span></h3><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Tenacious Inspiration:</span><span>&nbsp;See my </span><span class="c31"><a class="c14" href="#h.btc6jbtt5iwp">Sidebar: Tenacious Inspiration</a></span><span>&nbsp;section below for a complete, statistical discussion of the relative advantages of Amazing Inspiration, Tenacious Inspiration, or both. The tl;dr version is that Amazing Inspiration is </span><span class="c15 c6">okay,</span><span>&nbsp;Tenacious Inspiration is </span><span class="c12 c6">better,</span><span>&nbsp;but both talents together are </span><span class="c6 c7">best.</span><span>&nbsp;My recommendation would be to take both or neither, but to take Tenacious Inspiration if you have to take one on its own.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h3 class="c0 c5" id="h.4f33a1ajb2cs"><span class="c37">19th Level</span></h3><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c35 c6">Greater Combat Inspiration:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;A fitting capstone for investigators, who are perpetually looking for ways to apply their inspiration rolls to literally everything. Now inspiration on attack rolls is free! Pity you have to wait this long to get it.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c36 c5" id="h.k533mvfhjwtq"><span class="c28">Studied Combat Enhancers</span></h2><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h3 class="c0 c5" id="h.3zisixdx6pht"><span class="c37">3rd Level</span></h3><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Twilight Talon Improvisation:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;As a &frac34;-BAB class with no bonus feats, the Improved [Maneuver] feats are generally traps unless they&rsquo;re given to you for free without the Combat Expertise prerequisite. Dirty trick is the most versatile of all the combat maneuvers, which is why I&rsquo;m not rating it red, but there&rsquo;s still something ironic about trying to blind someone as you let loose with what you hope will be an encounter-ending studied strike.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c6">Didactic Strike:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">I think I&rsquo;m safe in saying that Didactic Strike is garbage. The damage is all precision damage, so you can&rsquo;t pass it off to a crit-fishing ally, unlike Butterfly Sting. It might be good in niche, niche cases where you can&rsquo;t penetrate DR with your weapon, but an ally can, or if your accuracy is debuffed to the hilt, but an ally&rsquo;s is not. These instances aren&rsquo;t worth burning a talent on, though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c6">Timed Strike:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Timed Strike ultimately falls very flat. First, most combats will last only a few rounds, limiting the bonus damage. Second, Timed Strike penalizes you if you&rsquo;ve studied multiple targets sequentially. If you&rsquo;re not focused on one target, you&rsquo;re not stacking up the damage bonus. Third, you get only one chance at a studied strike, so even in the best-case scenario, you&rsquo;ll get your bonus damage precisely once. Fourth, the damage is precision damage, so it&rsquo;s not multiplied on a crit and is vulnerable to enemy immunities&mdash;although this is a limitation of studied strike generally, not Timed Strike specifically. Not worth it, in my estimation.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h3 class="c0 c5" id="h.ks9nj8jn84a5"><span class="c37">5th Level</span></h3><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c35 c6">Quick Study:</span><span>&nbsp;Quick Study is a peerless improvement to your use of the action economy, allowing you to study (swift action), move (move action), and strike (standard action). With </span><span class="c8">very</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;few exceptions, Quick Study should be your 5th-level talent.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Sapping Offensive:</span><span>&nbsp;No save, no studied strike requirement, just flat AoO denial. Especially as time goes on and enemies&rsquo; threatened squares grow more and more numerous, Sapping Offensive becomes indispensable for ally positioning. By the time your level enters the double digits, Sapping Offensive is rocking and rolling pretty hard.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Domino Effect:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Assuming you took Quick Study, Domino Effect is probably superfluous. Unlike Inquisitors or Warpriests, the swift action economy is pretty lax for investigators, which means you should have no trouble burning a swift action to switch to a new target after you perform your studied strike.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Numerical Strike:</span><span>&nbsp;Not only do you have to threaten a critical hit on your studied strike (remember, that&rsquo;s an opportunity you&rsquo;ll get only once per target, if that) you have to confirm it, too! Numerical Strike is decent when you need to ensure that an enemy with low HP dies from your crit, but otherwise acts only as a gateway to the much-better Greater Numerical Strike. Obviously do everything you can to become a crit-fisher if you take Numerical Strike&mdash;a </span><span class="c8">keen </span><span class="c1">rapier or Improved Critical (Rapier) will give a 15-20/x2 threat range.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h3 class="c0 c5" id="h.tfhvgt3ju5e1"><span class="c37">7th Level</span></h3><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Sickening Offensive:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;As with Sapping Offensive, Sickening Offensive is notable for its lack of an opposed save and studied strike requirement. You deal damage to a studied combat target, they get the debuff. And sickened is nice, too! A flat -2 to all saves, skills, to-hit checks, damage rolls...great stuff for contributing to the team effort.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c6">Slowing Strike:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;With a Fortitude save to negate, a weak effect that&rsquo;s easily reversed, and the studied strike requirement, Slowing Strike languishes at the bottom of the barrel. Recommended under no circumstances.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h3 class="c0 c5" id="h.tzyyc459xe1"><span class="c37">9th Level</span></h3><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c35 c6">Combat Inspiration:</span><span>&nbsp;If you </span><span class="c8">ever</span><span>&nbsp;intend to use inspiration during combat, there&rsquo;s no reason to avoid Combat Inspiration. It doubles your inspiration economy; it paves the way for Greater Combat Inspiration, the worthiest of capstone talents; it makes your &frac34;-BAB chassis that much more effective in encounters. Take it, and especially take it with the </span><span class="c8">inspired</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;weapon enchantment for even more damage.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c32 c6 c7"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Studied Defense:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;The option to improve your AC rather than to-hit chances is great to have. Use Studied Defense against weaker minions that you&rsquo;re confident you&rsquo;ll be able to hit without your bonuses; bosses will penetrate extra AC anyway, and you&rsquo;ll need all the help you can get to hit them.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Toppling Strike:</span><span>&nbsp;Trip is OP against humanoid creatures, but the issue with this combat maneuver has always been that you can&rsquo;t guarantee that you&rsquo;ll be </span><span class="c8">fighting</span><span>&nbsp;humanoid creatures. Probably bumps up to green if you also selected </span><span class="c12 c6">Unbalancing Trick,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;but only just. I still don&rsquo;t like that all of the studied strike talents require you to burn your studied strike in order to use them.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h3 class="c0 c5" id="h.at4mz1817blc"><span class="c37">13th Level</span></h3><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Greater Numerical Strike:</span><span>&nbsp;You need to both threaten and confirm your crit in order to use Greater Numerical Strike. If you can, however...hoo laddie, is it powerful. Maximizing weapon </span><span class="c8">and</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;studied strike damage makes for one powerful nova strike.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Prolonged Study:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span><span>Even the dumbest investigator will probably have a +6 or +7 Intelligence modifier by their career&rsquo;s end, which should be plenty of time to focus on one target. If your Intelligence is lower, or you fight a lot of protracted battles where your enemies are striking and disappearing, Prolonged Study might rate a </span><span class="c32 c6 c7">blue.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c6">Iconoclastic Strike:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s nice that you don&rsquo;t provoke on the sunder attempt, and nicer still that you always deal maximum damage. Divine casters (when they&rsquo;re present) usually own multiple holy symbols or have figured out a way to turn their holy symbol into some part of their body or equipment, though. On balance, not worth it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c6">Repositioning Strike:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Reposition is weak. You have &frac34; BAB. You only get this effect once per target, and then only when you&rsquo;re just about to kill them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c6">Stealing Strike:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Same basic problems as the other [Maneuver] Strike talents.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h3 class="c0 c5" id="h.j5ethb40tb1i"><span class="c37">15th Level</span></h3><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Silencing Strike:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Fortitude saves and the silenced condition make this ability fairly good for hunting casters, especially as you get a limited effect even on a successful save. One of the few Strike talents I would consider, although you&rsquo;ll need to keep in mind that the Silent Spell metamagic feat nullifies this talent&rsquo;s effects.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c6">Deafening Strike:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Deafened is a weak condition, and at this level, nearly any caster will be able to remove the effect even if you do manage a failed save.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h3 class="c0 c5" id="h.gyr4q5tizk1k"><span class="c37">17th Level</span></h3><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Masterful Numerical Strike:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;If you came this far with the Numerical Strike line, Masterful Numerical Strike is a decent choice. It does compete with Eternal Potion, however, which should almost certainly be your 17th-level pick.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Blinding Strike:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Blinded is a powerful condition in earlier levels, but not especially powerful at 17th level, when magical healing, blindsight, multiple eyes, and sky-high Fortitude saves run rampant. I can&rsquo;t realistically give it more than a yellow.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h3 class="c0 c5" id="h.1o05wju3cz2w"><span class="c37">19th Level</span></h3><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c35 c6">Greater Combat Inspiration:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;A fitting capstone for investigators, who are perpetually looking for ways to apply their inspiration rolls to literally everything. Now inspiration on attack rolls is free! Pity you have to wait this long to get it.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Confusing Strike:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Getting one round of confusion on a successful save is nice, but you have to remember that 90% of the stuff you fight at 19th level will be outright immune to this effect.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c36 c5" id="h.akyuyd5jx3jh"><span class="c28">Miscellaneous Talents</span></h2><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h3 class="c0 c5" id="h.5d9evokzrj2r"><span class="c37">3rd Level</span></h3><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Effortless Aid:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Builds focusing on the aid another action are a niche application of the Pathfinder rules, but can be astonishingly powerful in the right hands. If you&rsquo;re a halfling or other aid another specialist, Effortless Aid is a great purchase for you.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Chronicler&rsquo;s Insight:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;With Pathfinder Chronicles costing only 50 gp, Chronicler&rsquo;s Insight gives you a good amount of versatility and power in exchange for its paltry monetary and inspiration cost. The Local and Nobility benefits outperform in social and intrigue scenarios, Engineering is great in dungeon crawls, and Arcana, Nature, Planes, Religion, and Dungeoneering can find a home in everyday combat situations, although it&rsquo;s unfortunate that they mostly apply to studied strike, and not studied combat. Even History is good if you&rsquo;re playing an investigator with a lower Intelligence score.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Eldritch Conduit:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;The ability is a little bit tough to envision, but it&rsquo;s worth buying or crafting a high-level potion, wand, or scroll to keep on your person for the instances when you need to supercharge another spell-trigger item you found.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Numerical Alchemy:</span><span>&nbsp;Assuming you leave some of your extracts unprepared at the start of the day, Numerical Alchemy can be a great ability to have for those fights where you have the </span><span class="c8">perfect</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;formula in your formula book.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Occult Dungeoneer:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;A great dungeon-crawling tool, especially early in your career, when you won&rsquo;t be able to beat UMD checks reliably for wands.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Spell Storing:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;If you have an allied spellcaster who&rsquo;s fine with buffing you, it&rsquo;s nice to be able to decide when that buff begins.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Unbalancing Trick:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;One of the few ways that investigators should attempt combat maneuvers.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Applied Engineering:</span><span>&nbsp;I </span><span class="c8">love</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;the flavor of Applied Engineering, especially since Strength checks are usually so difficult to beat. The idea of an investigator with 8 Strength smashing down an adamantine door with nothing more than his mind is...fun. Mechanically, however, these are niche effects that won&rsquo;t be applicable all the time. I&rsquo;m duty-bound to rate it yellow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Castling:</span><span>&nbsp;Castling is one of those abilities that looks unassuming on its surface, but has major implications. If you&rsquo;re playing a </span><span class="c12 c6">Small-sized ranged character</span><span>&nbsp;who can scurry through a battlefield to position friends between himself and the big-bad, you&rsquo;ll be getting some pretty excellent benefits here. Toss in the </span><span class="c6 c7">Fortified Position talent and Knowledge (Geography) benefit of Chronicler&rsquo;s Insight,</span><span>&nbsp;and you&rsquo;ve got a wombo combo building up. Don&rsquo;t forget that enemies can&rsquo;t take AoOs against creatures with cover; Castling can be used as a janky Escape Route in a pinch.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">False Spellcaster:</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span>It&rsquo;s an interesting ability if you&rsquo;re looking to fake being an arcane or divine spellcaster; just hold a holy symbol or arcane-looking book and chant mumbo-jumbo incantations. If you have the </span><span class="c6 c7">Infusion talent,</span><span>&nbsp;the talent&rsquo;s worth goes up considerably, as you no longer need something like an injection spear to put extracts into enemies, and no longer need to waste time with drinking to put extracts into friends.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c15">Favored Beat:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Vigilantes can very easily burn their entire complement of talents on Renown and its older cousins. Some of the talents available to you are decent, but without a Vigilante identity, you can&rsquo;t leverage most of the benefits of Renown. I&rsquo;d skip it in most instances.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Fortified Position:</span><span>&nbsp;Soft cover doesn&rsquo;t provide any bonus to Reflex saves, so Fortified Position is only useful in circumstances where you&rsquo;re partially or fully sheltered behind a solid object. This talent can, however, be excellent for </span><span class="c6 c7">ranged investigators who took the Castling talent.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Now every bit of soft cover is normal cover!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Just a Face in the Crowd:</span><span>&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re playing </span><span class="c8">Hell&rsquo;s Rebels,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">War for the Crown, Council of Thieves, Curse of the Crimson Throne,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and other city-based campaigns, sure. Everywhere else, you&rsquo;re unlikely to see benefit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Perceptive Tracking:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Perception is certainly way better than Survival, at least in non-wilderness games. Even so, following tracks is a niche activity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">The Whole Time:</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">Invisibility</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c8">greater invisibility</span><span>&nbsp;are already on your spell list, so the only real benefit is gaining access to </span><span class="c8">vanish</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(not a bad idea) and being able to sheathe your weapon as a free action.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c6">Anathema:</span><span>&nbsp;Poison in Pathfinder is bad. Unless you&rsquo;re playing with </span><span class="c8">Spheres of Might</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and using the Alchemy sphere, you shouldn&rsquo;t use Anathema.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c6">Extra Earthcraft:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;This would only be important if you were multiclassing with an earthshadow rogue.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c6">Greater Anathema:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;As Anathema. Trade away your poisons, for the love of Groetus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c6">Hidden Agendas:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;This is a worthy talent for any GM to challenge their PCs with, but only narrowly applicable for PC investigators.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c6">One of Those Faces:</span><span>&nbsp;You have </span><span class="c8">disguise self</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;on your class list. This shouldn&rsquo;t be an issue.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c6">Scrying Familiarity:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Another talent that&rsquo;s of more use to GMs as they try to hide their evil investigator&rsquo;s activities from a PC wizard.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h3 class="c0 c5" id="h.3s5gbgfbwkx9"><span class="c37">5th Level</span></h3><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c6">Lingering Venom:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t poison.

Even without that utility, Knowledge checks often help players piece together in-game mysteries, advance the plot, and accomplish other useful narrative purposes. Eidetic Recollection is therefore </span><span class="c8">extraordinarily</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;useful for skill monkeys.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Greater Numerical Alchemy:</span><span>&nbsp;Even if Greater Numerical Alchemy doesn&rsquo;t </span><span class="c8">significantly</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;improve on what Numerical Alchemy brings to the table, it&rsquo;s still quite good. Never again will you need to go without the perfect extract!</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c36 c5" id="h.wbnju34rz8h"><span class="c28">Alchemist Discoveries</span></h2><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h3 class="c0 c5" id="h.yxjfume0nhun"><span class="c37">2nd Level</span></h3><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c35 c6">Extend Potion:</span><span>&nbsp;Free Extend Spell on a bunch of potions per day! Used with high-CL potions, </span><span class="c8">alchemical allocation, </span><span>and </span><span class="c8">amplify elixir,</span><span>&nbsp;you can easily get buffs that last all day: I&rsquo;m talking </span><span class="c8">barkskin, greater magic fang, heroism,</span><span>&nbsp;the like. With Extend Potion, </span><span class="c8">amplify elixir,</span><span>&nbsp;and a CL 20 potion that lasts 10 minutes/level, you&rsquo;ll get 5 hours of buffing for the cost of one 2nd- and one 3rd-level spell. Spells that last hours/level can simply be Extended to last all day. </span><span class="c8">As if this weren&rsquo;t enough</span><span class="c1">, Extend Potion opens the door to Eternal Potion, which is your 17th-level investigator talent, no questions asked.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Enhance Potion:</span><span>&nbsp;Enhance Potion causes potions to behave more or less like extracts, which are automatically heightened to your caster level. This allows you to craft weaker 1st-, 2nd-, and 3rd-level potions at their lowest possible caster level, then boost them as you drink them. Improving the caster level of these items is critical for effects that rely on opposed caster level checks (</span><span class="c8">remove disease, remove curse, neutralize poison,</span><span>&nbsp;etc.) and for effects that get better as CL increases (</span><span class="c8">cure</span><span>&nbsp;spells, </span><span class="c8">resist energy, protection from energy, greater magic fang,</span><span>&nbsp;etc.). And because you can </span><span class="c8">also</span><span>&nbsp;use these enhanced potions with </span><span class="c8">alchemical allocation,</span><span>&nbsp;you can look forward to enhancing &lsquo;em all day, every day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Infusion:</span><span>&nbsp;Although I&rsquo;m rating Infusion blue, it&rsquo;s essentially a talent tax in order to be able to use your extracts on allies. That stinks. Some points to remember: first, recall that the spell slot you used to create the extract remains filled until the person you gave your infusion to uses it. At the worst, it&rsquo;s possible for enemies to steal your infusions, locking you out of casting until you recover them. I&rsquo;m not saying that scenario is likely, only that the rules make it possible. Second, this discovery enables you to use extracts on enemies with a </span><span class="c31"><a class="c14" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://aonprd.com/EquipmentWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName%3DSyringe%2520spear&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117394802000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3pNqaBY00Yd5VKum6ttYw3">syringe spear</a></span><span>&nbsp;or similar piece of equipment. The classic combo is </span><span class="c8">skinsend</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;with a syringe spear, which separates a foe from its body with no save; you then coup de grace the helpless corpse.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Mutagen:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Why are there so many good alchemist discoveries!? Mutagen is particularly potent for Dexterity-based investigators, who won&rsquo;t mind a dip in Wisdom as much as Strength-based investigators will mind a dip in Intelligence. Mutagen has always been great, and will always be great.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c6">Concentrate Poison:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Don&rsquo;t use poison.

Sure, you&rsquo;re using up a higher-level resource, but you also get to double your action economy, which can be </span><span class="c8">crucial</span><span>&nbsp;in a surprise round.

If you do that, Dilution creates 2x the potions for only .75x their market value. Quite nice!</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h3 class="c0 c5" id="h.f9oszh7rw3e"><span class="c37">16th Level</span></h3><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c35 c6">Eternal Potion:</span><span>&nbsp;Holy cow.

The core rogue as a class is, by and large, bad. It won&rsquo;t be surprising, therefore, that there aren&rsquo;t many mechanically decent abilities to be found on the list. Take a look at the green talents, and let the rest go. They&rsquo;re not worth it when you have so many amazing alchemist discoveries and investigator talents to choose from.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Charmer:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;I like that you eventually gain the ability to use this talent more than once per day. You&rsquo;ll like it if you&rsquo;re the party face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Fast Stealth:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Sure! Moving at half speed while using Stealth can be a bit of a pain, especially if you&rsquo;re trying to do it in the middle of a combat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Got Your Back:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Again, a good one for aid another builds. Get into flanking, then pass all these benefits to an ally.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Iron Guts:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Investigators have poor Fortitude saves. You could certainly do worse than give yourself a hefty buff against effects that will sicken, nauseate, or poison you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Peerless Maneuver:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Sapping Offensive is a much better choice if you&rsquo;re looking to avoid AoOs, but I suppose Peerless Maneuver is available if you have to jump like Jordan for a round.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Resiliency:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span><span>It&rsquo;s best to drop and </span><span class="c8">pretend</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;to be unconscious, even if these temporary hit points keep you from dying.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Terrain Mastery:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Even without scaling benefits, getting a favored terrain can be quite strong if you tend to stay in one biome.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Trap Spotter:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Especially useful in dungeon crawls, when you don&rsquo;t want to spend a bunch of time checking every square for a trap.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Wall Scramble:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Investigators aren&rsquo;t likely to have invested very highly in Strength, and Climb isn&rsquo;t one of the skills you can add inspiration to, barring Unconventional Inspiration. Wall Scramble therefore represents a decent way to escape from pits and other nasty falls.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Acrobatic Assist:</span><span>&nbsp;You could do worse than Acrobatic Assist&mdash;and many rogue talents will. Builds focusing on Effortless Aid and the aid another action will be able to put it to good use here. Much easier to take Sapping Offensive and deny </span><span class="c8">any</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;AoOs, though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Black Market Connections:</span><span>&nbsp;I mean, maybe, </span><span class="c8">maybe</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;your GM plays using Pathfinder&rsquo;s rules for determining which magical items are for sale in a given location. I haven&rsquo;t run across many GMs who can be bothered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Canny Observer:</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">A straight bonus to a decent chunk of Perception checks. Especially useful if you&rsquo;re the designated trap spotter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Convincing Lie:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span>Even though Convincing Lie is niche enough that I don&rsquo;t think it would find a home in any but the most intrigue-heavy campaigns, it&rsquo;s still a heck of a lot of fun. Incept people, start rumors that spread like wildfire through a town, have someone use </span><span class="c8">modify memory</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and then Bluff your way into a convincing alibi...lots of possibilities, even though most of them aren&rsquo;t directly useful in combat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Expert Leaper:</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Sure, why not? I still wouldn&rsquo;t prioritize this ability over just about anything else, but it&rsquo;s not a trap option.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Grit:</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Steel hounds will want this boi.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Honeyed Words:</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span>Bluff checks are typically very, </span><span class="c8">very</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;important. I still wouldn&rsquo;t call this ability great with limited uses per day, but it&rsquo;s okay at what it does.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Stand Up:</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Getting knocked prone stinks, and Stand Up fixes that pretty well. Still, I don&rsquo;t think this would come up enough to rate more than yellow.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c6">Assault Leader:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Once per day. Pass. (Weak, 1/day powers will be a running theme with rogue talents, so get ready.)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c6">Camouflage:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Once per day, and only in limited terrains.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c6">Coax Information:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Coax Information doesn&rsquo;t affect Intimidate checks made to demoralize a foe. Anyway, Bruising Intellect + Underworld Inspiration will do a much better job at this goal than Coax Information.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c6">Combat Swipe:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span>Unlike Unbalancing Trick, Combat Swipe does nothing to alleviate the prerequisites for Greater Steal or Quick Steal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c6">Cunning Trigger:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span>Traps aren&rsquo;t effective in core Pathfinder.

What these debates tend to ignore, however, is that Tenacious Inspiration (which is typically rated much higher) isn&rsquo;t </span><span class="c8">all</span><span>&nbsp;that much better, at least in isolation. I&rsquo;ve taken the liberty of </span><span class="c31"><a class="c14" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://anydice.com/program/19cca&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117394818000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2lu6U_SmkZdLCgD-ul_40C">crunching the math underlying this problem</a></span><span>&nbsp;on </span><span class="c31"><a class="c14" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://anydice.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117394818000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2-bDrbT4mdYdqbRxVx2Htk">AnyDice.com</a></span><span class="c1">. (AnyDice is amazing, by the way, and has helped me out with many Pathfinder questions. Kudos to Jasper Flick for creating this great resource.) In order, the rolls are 1) Base Inspiration, 2) Base Inspiration with Tenacious Inspiration, 3) Amazing Inspiration, and 4) Amazing Inspiration with Tenacious Inspiration. I&rsquo;d like to highlight a few things.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, while Amazing Inspiration can increase your average inspiration rolls in a linear fashion (1d6 has an average of 3.5, 1d8 has an average of 4.5, 1d10 has an average of 5.5, etc.) Tenacious Inspiration increases your average roll </span><span class="c8">more</span><span>&nbsp;the higher your die size goes. The &ldquo;best of two&rdquo; mechanic on 2d6 results in an increase of only .97, whereas &ldquo;best of two&rdquo; on 2d8 increases your average result by 1.31. Once you get into 2d10&mdash;possible only with the Focused Inspiration feat&mdash;you get an increase of 1.65. In research, this is known as an </span><span class="c8">interaction effect,</span><span>&nbsp;where we see differential effects on a dependent variable (in this case, our die roll) depending on which combination of </span><span class="c8">two</span><span>&nbsp;independent variables was present. Tenacious Inspiration has an outsized effect in the Amazing Inspiration + Tenacious Inspiration match-up than it does in the Inspiration + Tenacious Inspiration match-up. This interaction effect is something that&rsquo;s readily visible if you look at the graph of this effect&mdash;the slope of Amazing Inspiration + Tenacious Inspiration is higher than Inspiration + Tenacious Inspiration. This being the case, it&rsquo;s fairly easy for me to recommend that you 1) take </span><span class="c8">neither</span><span>&nbsp;Amazing Inspiration </span><span class="c8">nor</span><span>&nbsp;Tenacious Inspiration, or 2) take </span><span class="c8">both</span><span>&nbsp;Amazing Inspiration </span><span class="c8">and</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Tenacious Inspiration. Taken singly, neither Amazing Inspiration nor Tenacious Inspiration does much more than raise your average roll by 1; combine them, however, and the effects aren&rsquo;t additive, they&rsquo;re multiplicative&mdash;you get a 2.31-point bump.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c63 c48">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have to take one and not the other, though, the mathematically &ldquo;correct&rdquo; answer to take Tenacious Inspiration. Why? Well, it has to do with the standard deviations of this probability array. For those of you who haven&rsquo;t yet had the great good fortune to take a statistics class (/sarcasm) standard deviation is a measure of how </span><span class="c63 c48 c8">dispersed</span><span class="c63 c48">&nbsp;data are. Think of it like a shotgun blast of data: if your standard deviation is large, you&rsquo;ll spray pellets all over the side of a barn; if your standard deviation is small, you&rsquo;ll be able to put those pellets into a 1-foot spread instead. Amazing Inspiration and Tenacious Inspiration each increase your mean (i.e., average) roll by about 1 point to 4.5. Tenacious Inspiration has the added effect, however, of decreasing the standard deviation of the array, meaning that you&rsquo;ll see your rolls clustering more reliably around that 4.5 mark, rather than seeing them spray randomly between 1 and 8 with Amazing Inspiration.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h1 class="c36 c5" id="h.4e94h2iuag0g"><span class="c41 c6">INV 305: Feats</span></h1><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investigators are </span><span class="c8">perpetually</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;crunched for feats! There&rsquo;s combat efficacy to consider, and skill buffs, and more instances of Extra Inspiration or Extra Investigator Talent...it can all feel a little overwhelming at times. When building an investigator, just remember the old acronym KISS: Keep It Simple, Stupid. We&rsquo;re not fighters, we&rsquo;re not brawlers; we&rsquo;re a &frac34;-BAB striking class that has to use what it&rsquo;s got as intelligently as if the player had the same Intelligence score as the player&rsquo;s character. I&rsquo;ve tried to break combat functions up into the three broad categories that investigators will pursue (Melee Strength, Melee Dexterity, and Ranged Dexterity) and place other feats in their respective categories. Enjoy!</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c36 c5" id="h.155nvzoyoqku"><span class="c28">Combat Feats</span></h2><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h3 class="c0 c5" id="h.xs4px4kyz2mh"><span>Universal</span></h3><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Barroom Brawler:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Even 1/day, martial flexibility is a powerful ability. Darkness that you can&rsquo;t fix? Blind-Fight. Pinned down by AoOs? Mobility. Big ugly monster? Big Game Hunter. You can&rsquo;t progress all the way up feat trees like brawlers can, but it&rsquo;s enough.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Improved Initiative:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&ldquo;Those who go first, go last&rdquo; should be Pathfinder&rsquo;s unofficial motto. As traditionally Dexterity-based combatants, investigators have to be particularly militant about avoiding the flat-footed condition. You really do want to go first in order to extract up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Lunge:</span><span>&nbsp;The hit to AC is a little hard to swallow on a class that already has some difficulties with defenses, but there&rsquo;s no substitute for reach when you need it. Less necessary if you&rsquo;re </span><span class="c15 c6">investing heavily in </span><span class="c8 c15 c6">long arm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Nature Soul + Animal Ally + Boon Companion:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Three feats is a steep, steep price to pay, but the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow is your very own animal companion, scaled fully with your level! &ldquo;Beary, stay.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Big Game Hunter:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Large and larger creatures make up a large proportion of later CR tranches. You could do worse than to pick this ability up at 11th level or so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Blind-Fight:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Especially if you&rsquo;re human or another race that lacks darkvision, you may wish to pick up Blind-Fight. Concealment comes up more often than players think it will, and it&rsquo;s a huge boon to be able to reroll your miss chances like this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Combat Reflexes:</span><span>&nbsp;With </span><span class="c8">long arm</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c8">enlarge person</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;on your class list, most investigators have the potential to set up an &ldquo;oh no no zone&rdquo; where extended reach combines with AoOs to stop enemies from moving around effectively. Combat Reflexes is a necessary element in that playstyle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Death from Above:</span><span>&nbsp;Something of an unusual feat choice, but hear me out: you&rsquo;ve got </span><span class="c8">fly</span><span>&nbsp;on your list, and any number of your polymorph extracts allow you to fly. And +5 is a </span><span class="c8">huge</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;bonus to hit. Huge. I wouldn&rsquo;t make it my 1st-level feat choice, but at 11th, 13th, 15th? Maybe then.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Dirty Fighting:</span><span>&nbsp;To be clear: I&rsquo;m not advocating that investigators use combat maneuvers. </span><span class="c8">But if you were going to use combat maneuvers</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;through the relevant investigator talents, Dirty Fighting would be the correct way to clear away prerequisites for you to advance to the Improved and Greater [Maneuver] feats.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Ghostslayer:</span><span>&nbsp;Incorporeal creatures, like oozes or swarms, are one of those encounter types that all Pathfinder players must have some means (however rudimentary) of dealing with. If you&rsquo;re not willing to shell out for a </span><span class="c8">ghost touch</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;weapon or ghost salt weapon blanches, Ghostslayer does a good job of prepping you for those encounters.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Great Fortitude:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Your Fortitude save is generally poor. Not bad if you feel your defenses flagging a bit!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Improved Critical:</span><span>&nbsp;With rapiers on your proficiency list, there&rsquo;s a good chance that you&rsquo;ll want to do some crit-fishing in your spare time. At BAB +8, Improved Critical isn&rsquo;t the </span><span class="c8">greatest</span><span>&nbsp;tool for getting that done&mdash;you may turn to the </span><span class="c8">keen</span><span>&nbsp;weapon enchantment before considering this feat&mdash;but it&rsquo;s still worthwhile. Remember that you&rsquo;ll be crit-fishing less for your own damage output and more for enchantments (</span><span class="c8">sapping, flaming burst, </span><span>etc.) that grant better effects on a crit or niche playstyles like Butterfly Sting that let you &ldquo;use&rdquo; crits without resolving them yourself. You can&rsquo;t take your studied combat damage with ya, folks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Mobility:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Investigators are meant to be pretty mobile, so this wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad investment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Open Conduit:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Conduit feats are among the more powerful feats in Pathfinder, and I&rsquo;ve reviewed a number of them here. Open Conduit is a great way to use those feats more often.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Scale and Skin:</span><span>&nbsp;Investigators can expect to be under the effects of a transmutation spell much of the time, hence Scale and Skin is a pretty easy route to a +1 or +2 natural armor AC that will stack with your </span><span class="c8">amulet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Toughness:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;More HP. Worth considering if your race features a hit to Constitution and you plan to spend any time in melee range.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Weapon Versatility:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Sad about the Weapon Focus requirement, but otherwise a fantastic feat for penetrating DR/Type.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Combat Expertise:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Combat Expertise isn&rsquo;t actually the worst feat in the world on an investigator, who will generally have more offense available through studied combat and their various extracts than defense. Combat Expertise can make you a little safer as a lightly armored striker class. It&rsquo;s also horrendously common as a prerequisite&mdash;not for feats that you&rsquo;re likely to take, granted, but a prerequisite nevertheless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Defensive Combat Training:</span><span>&nbsp;As a &frac34;-BAB class that&rsquo;s expected to function primarily in melee range, CMD will always be a going concern: one grapple, one trip, one bull rush gone wrong, and you might find yourself in a very sticky situation. Defensive Combat Training doesn&rsquo;t entirely solve that problem, but it&rsquo;s better than nothing if your GM is maneuver-happy or you&rsquo;re playing with a system like </span><span class="c8">Spheres of Might.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Divine Fighting Technique (Cayden Cailean&rsquo;s Blade and Tankard) + Two-Weapon Fighting:</span><span>&nbsp;I would normally </span><span class="c8">never</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;recommend TWF to investigators, but Cayden&rsquo;s DFT is interesting because it allows you to fill up your tankard with potions or extracts that can then be consumed as part of a full-attack action. The prerequisites&mdash;especially for the advanced boon&mdash;are steep, but possibly worth it if you&rsquo;re really looking to maximize your use of the action economy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Divine Fighting Technique (Urgathoa&rsquo;s Hunger):</span><span>&nbsp;Only </span><span class="c35 c6">Gravediggers</span><span>&nbsp;are proficient with scythes, but holy cow, what a power! Especially if you&rsquo;re rocking a </span><span class="c8">keen</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;scythe and confirm your critical hit, you can easily rack up 60-75 temporary HP with this feat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Dodge:</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">A minor buff to AC, but not nothing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Improved / Greater [Manuver]:</span><span>&nbsp;Thanks to studied combat&mdash;and studied combat alone&mdash;investigators don&rsquo;t do </span><span class="c8">too</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;badly at combat maneuvers, although Dexterity-based investigators will need to pick up the Agile Maneuvers feat to add their Dexterity to CMB. On the whole, though, combat maneuvers are a small corner of martial combat, only circumstantially useful, and highly reliant on feat investment. They&rsquo;re not quite a trap for the class, but they&rsquo;re certainly not what I would recommend pursuing with all your might.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Quick Draw:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Nearly no one has space for this feat, but it&rsquo;s a nice improvement to the action economy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Vital Strike / Improved VS / Greater VS / </span><span class="c12 c6">Devastating Strike:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Studied combat is the real deciding factor in figuring out whether any particular combat style is worthwhile for an investigator. Being proficient with primarily light, simple weapons means your damage dice will always be rather small; that makes Vital Strike a poor choice. Getting primarily precision damage from studied combat makes your crits rather unimpressive; that makes crit-fishing a poor choice. These can be phenomenal feats, but work best on other classes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Shikigami Style / Mimicry / Manipulation:</span><span>&nbsp;Only for </span><span class="c6 c7">gravediggers</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;going for improvised weapon builds, but it&rsquo;s amazing in that context.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Soulblade:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Interesting feat for haunt-heavy games.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c6">Arcane Strike:</span><span>&nbsp;Most unfortunately, even though investigators are &ldquo;spellcasters&rdquo; after a fashion, </span><span class="c31"><a class="c14" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://paizo.com/threads/rzs2oxx4?Alchemist-Arcane-Strike-feat&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117394829000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1Z3EDXShW3nKlyo3o38Fe-">they don&rsquo;t count as arcane casters for the purposes of qualifying for Arcane Strike.</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Too bad, too, because it&rsquo;s a great feat for certain builds.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c6">Combat Casting:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;There&rsquo;s no such thing as &ldquo;drinking defensively,&rdquo; so Combat Casting and other abilities that improve your concentration checks are worthless to an investigator. You either find a way to get out of range, or you take the AoO.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c6">Cunning Killer:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Cunning Killer would be quite a good feat for investigators, but both your studied combat class feature and Cunning Killer are insight bonuses, and insight bonuses don&rsquo;t stack.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h3 class="c0 c5" id="h.4qdprbqhqftj"><span class="c37">Magehunting</span></h3><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Step Up / Following Step / Step Up and Strike:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve grown to love Step Up and Following Step more and more as I play more Pathfinder. Spellcasters and ranged combatants will go to great lengths to avoid needing to take AoOs or cast defensively, but Step Up makes it way, way harder to do any of that. Whenever I want to boost the CR of an encounter by 1 or so, I give a few of the combatants Step Up. Elegant, simple, and deadly.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Arcane Vendetta:</span><span>&nbsp;+2 damage isn&rsquo;t the best bonus in the world, but investigators should be using Spellcraft to identify </span><span class="c8">literally</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;every spell an enemy ever casts, so there&rsquo;s no opportunity cost to picking up Arcane Vendetta. Too bad it doesn&rsquo;t work on SLAs, though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Divine Defiance:</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">A straight +2 to all saves against divine spells, divine SLAs, and spells or SLAs cast by outsiders with affinities toward a certain deity is amazing. Atheist Inspiration is also available to do the same thing, but with an action cost. Your call, buckaroo.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Eagle&rsquo;s Resolve:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;A fun bonus to [mind-affecting] saves and to improve your offensive capabilities against casters.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Focused Disbelief:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;SR is one more layer of defenses when you&rsquo;re hunting down clerics, inquisitors, warpriests, etc. Good stuff.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h3 class="c0 c5" id="h.xvdvscog45gn"><span class="c37">Melee (Strength)</span></h3><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Armor Proficiency, Medium:</span><span>&nbsp;Strength-based melee investigators won&rsquo;t want to have to split their point buy between Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, </span><span class="c8">and</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Intelligence. Even though I&rsquo;m loath to recommend yet another feat, Strength-based melee investigators will have the most feats to burn, so they may wish to consider dropping their Dexterity and picking up Medium Armor Proficiency at 1st level, then Power Attack at 3rd.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Chaos Reigns:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;The absolute simplest way I know of to get an extra natural attack that benefits from studied combat and Strength bonuses. I&rsquo;m genuinely uncertain about whether this attack can be taken as part of a full-attack action with a two-handed weapon. My understanding was always that removing a hand from a weapon was a free action, hence that was possible, but I&rsquo;ve since heard that any appendage used as part of a full-attack action (both hands, in this case) can&rsquo;t be used to make further attacks. So: bites are fine, gores are fine, wings or tail slaps are fine&mdash;hand slams, potentially not fine. Talk with your GM, and skip this feat if they rule for the second interpretation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Power Attack:</span><span>&nbsp;A classic for all Strength-based melee classes. Between a mutagen and studied combat, you should have more than enough bonuses to make this work for you.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Furious Focus:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span><span>I think there&rsquo;s an argument to be made that Furious Focus is really designed for &frac34;-BAB classes. After all, you don&rsquo;t get as many iterative attacks, so Furious Focus boosts a higher percentage of your attacks, and your &frac34; BAB progression makes you less likely to land a hit, even attacking at your highest BAB. I wouldn&rsquo;t call this feat your </span><span class="c8">first</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;priority, but it&rsquo;s nice to have.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Eldritch Claws:</span><span>&nbsp;Potentially useful for a </span><span class="c12 c6">polymorph build</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;that relies heavily on natural attacks gained in their assumed form.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h3 class="c0 c5" id="h.4b4nf87i1vzs"><span class="c37">Melee (Dexterity)</span></h3><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Butterfly&rsquo;s Sting:</span><span>&nbsp;I have </span><span class="c8">no</span><span>&nbsp;idea why Combat Expertise is a prerequisite for this feat&mdash;blech&mdash;but it is. Anyway, if you&rsquo;re worshipping Desna and wielding a </span><span class="c8">keen</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;rapier or something similar, there&rsquo;s no excuse not to have Butterfly&rsquo;s Sting. Very little of your damage will transfer over to a crit, so why not let someone else have it? If it&rsquo;s a x3 or x4 crit, even better.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Weapon Finesse / Dervish Dance / Bladed Brush / Slashing Grace / Starry Grace / Fencing Grace:</span><span>&nbsp;If you want my opinion, Pathfinder has </span><span class="c8">way too many</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;feats that deal with Dexterity-to-attack and Dexterity-to-damage. Barring any dips, by far the most common path to the Dexterity-based melee playstyle is Weapon Finesse + Weapon Focus + Fencing Grace with a rapier. You&rsquo;ll take one level of inspired blade swashbuckler and be golden.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Possessed Hand:</span><span>&nbsp;What a weird choice, right? But the mechanics are solid for investigators: bonuses to attack and damage, a few skill bonuses, and best of all, the penalty doesn&rsquo;t even apply to your brand of casting. You&rsquo;ll also want to consider Hand&rsquo;s Autonomy and Hand&rsquo;s Sight, which are two great upgrades to this feat path.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Piranha Strike:</span><span>&nbsp;Fun fact: rapiers aren&rsquo;t light weapons, so you can&rsquo;t actually use Piranha Strike with them by default. Unless you</span><span class="c12 c6">&nbsp;use </span><span class="c8 c12 c6">effortless lace</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span>or something similar to be able to treat rapiers as light weapons, you won&rsquo;t be able to use Piranha Strike on a boilerplate Dexvestigator.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c6">Agile Maneuvers:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t bother with maneuvers if you&rsquo;re Dexterity-based. Too much risk for far too little reward.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h3 class="c0 c5" id="h.z00276tz02hk"><span class="c37">Ranged</span></h3><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c35 c6">Ranged Study:</span><span>&nbsp;If you want to do a ranged investigator </span><span class="c8">at all,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;you need Ranged Study. Period. Unfortunately, it also requires Weapon Focus (why all the ridiculous feat taxes?) so that&rsquo;s a minimum of five feats (Weapon Focus, Ranged Study, PBS, Precise Shot, and Rapid Shot) to get going with a ranged build. Even more, if you&rsquo;re using crossbows. Gah.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Deadly Aim:</span><span>&nbsp;Under normal circumstances, I probably wouldn&rsquo;t recommend a feat like Deadly Aim to &frac34;-BAB classes. On a rogue, for example, it would be something of a trap&mdash;without attack bonuses, &frac34;-BAB classes don&rsquo;t have the to-hit chances to manage accuracy-for-damage tradeoffs like this. Assuming you can get your studied combat going with Ranged Study, however, the investigator&rsquo;s chances to hit are quite good; slap on </span><span class="c8">bracers of archery</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and some buffing extracts, and Deadly Aim becomes as useful to you as it is to full-BAB characters. Prioritize must-have feats like Point-Blank Shot, Precise Shot, and Rapid Shot first, but after that, feel free to get Deadly Aim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Focused Shot:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Now, granted, Focused Shot is incompatible with full-attack actions, but let&rsquo;s be real: not every combat permits you to take full-attack after full-attack with zero interruptions. Sometimes you&rsquo;ve got to stay mobile, whether to kite an enemy, get to a more defensible position, etc., and when that&rsquo;s the case, you may as well add on a bunch of damage for free. There&rsquo;s no official in-text ruling on whether this additional damage is precision damage, but because enemies who are immune to sneak attacks and crits are also immune to Focused Shot, my ruling would be that it is precision damage, hence not multiplied on a crit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Improved Precise Shot:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a very late entry into the investigator&rsquo;s arsenal, but a must-have. Enjoy it when you get it at 15th level.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Point-Blank Shot / Precise Shot / Rapid Shot:</span><span>&nbsp;The three must-have feats for any archer. Studied combat (once you get it, that is) should make your Rapid Shot nice and accurate, especially with other buffs like </span><span class="c8">reduce person</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Rapid Reload / Crossbow Mastery:</span><span>&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re using crossbows or firearms (as a steel hound) you&rsquo;ll need Rapid Reload, and possibly Crossbow Mastery, to boot. Ranged combat in Pathfinder is full of feat taxes; that&rsquo;s just the price you pay. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Auspicious Birth:</span><span>&nbsp;Auspicious Birth isn&rsquo;t </span><span class="c8">as</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;great for investigators as it is for some classes (I mean, how great is Conjunction for inquisitors, cavaliers, hunters, etc.?) but it still handles itself decently. Eclipse and Meteor Shower are the only two that I would recommend, and then only for ranged investigators&mdash;not that they&rsquo;re likely to have any feats left to spare.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Bullseye Shot:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;When you need to hit, you need to hit. The extra accuracy can be worth the trade-off for your iterative attacks, especially against high-AC enemies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Clustered Shots:</span><span>&nbsp;With fewer iterative attacks than full-BAB classes, Clustered Shots isn&rsquo;t </span><span class="c8">as</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;necessary as it is elsewhere for cutting through damage reduction. Still, you might consider it at 9th or 11th level.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Hammer the Gap:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Good on any character, especially with Rapid Shot, but investigators have fewer iterative attacks than full-BAB classes to take advantage of this ability.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Snap Shot / Improved:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Excellent feats for ranged characters, although you&rsquo;ll likely want Point-Blank Master before you go here.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Manyshot:</span><span>&nbsp;Ohhh, poor Manyshot. So great for slayers, rangers, fighters, etc., and so lackluster for ranged investigators. The issue here boils down to </span><span>studied</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;combat, as it always does. Studied combat is precision damage, and thus doesn&rsquo;t multiply on your Manyshot. Lacking any great way to add multiplicable damage to your ranged attacks, Manyshot falls kinda flat. Still decent, but less effective than it can be.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c36 c5" id="h.omt5nerskqp1"><span class="c28">Skill &amp; Utility Feats</span></h2><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c35 c6">Deific / Fey Obedience (Irori / Magdh):</span><span>&nbsp;If you have space for only one skill monkey feat in your build, make it a Deific Obedience to one of these two gods. Magdh worship is a little more niche as one of the Eldest, but her Obedience benefit is </span><span class="c8">insane&mdash;</span><span>a +4 bonus to </span><span class="c8">every </span><span class="c1">Intelligence-based skill check! If you&rsquo;re not feeling like worshiping a Fey deity, Irori is far more common in the Inner Sea, but grants a +4 bonus only to Knowledge checks. Both are excellent.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Additional Traits:</span><span>&nbsp;Traits are even more important for investigators than for most characters, thanks to the bevy of traits that swap out your skill bonuses for Intelligence. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Breadth of Experience:</span><span>&nbsp;A +2 bonus to </span><span class="c8">all</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;your Knowledge checks. What&rsquo;s not to love for a skill monkey?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Divine Deception:</span><span>&nbsp;The march to a DC 20 UMD check to use wands of spells that aren&rsquo;t on your class list can be a long one. Divine Deception is a </span><span class="c8">massive</span><span>&nbsp;bonus to that check, easily able to put you in striking range for all the premium buffs available on the divine lists. </span><span class="c8">Barkskin, shield of faith, wrath, divine favor, bless,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;etc. can all be excellent additions to the investigator&rsquo;s arsenal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Skill Focus (Linguistics) + Orator:</span><span>&nbsp;A classic combination for investigators who also want to become the party face, Skill Focus (Linguistics) + Orator accomplishes a few goals: 1) lets you base your face skills off of Linguistics, essentially swapping your modifier for Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate to Intelligence, rather than Charisma; 2) gives you free inspiration on those same Linguistics checks; and 3) consolidates your skill point expenditures, giving you three skill ranks for free every time you sock a rank in Linguistics. Great benefits, all. Do remember, though, that Orator isn&rsquo;t a panacea: if you want to demoralize, feint, gather information, etc., then you&rsquo;ll need to actually invest in those skills. Student of Philosophy doesn&rsquo;t work with feint or gather information, although Bruising Intellect </span><span class="c8">will</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;work with demoralize.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Spirit-Ridden:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;The utility of Spirit-Ridden will depend entirely on how your GM interprets the phrase, &ldquo;while you&rsquo;re possessed, the spirit influences your personality.&rdquo; A quirky, eccentric love grilled cheese sandwiches? Fine. A sudden urge to cannibalize your teammates? Less fine. Nevertheless, this feat gives you (at minimum) one extra skill rank per level, plus a class bonus, all of which can be flexibly assigned as you need it. Makes the already-versatile investigator even more versatile.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Ancient Tradition:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span><span>This feat might come across as a little cheesy unless you really build it into your background, and I have no idea whether the boons stack with Deific Obedience. I haven&rsquo;t seen anything specific forbidding it on the Paizo forums or in the feat text. Azlant is good for most of the skill things you&rsquo;ll do as an investigator, but Tar Taargadth is the real winner. +2 to your Fortitude save </span><span class="c8">and</span><span>&nbsp;skill bonuses </span><span class="c8">and</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;SLAs? Yes, please.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Axiomatic Discourse:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Multiple free Diplomacy rerolls every day make Axiomatic Discourse great for party faces.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Dampen Presence:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span><span>If you&rsquo;re intending to do any heavy-duty Stealth work, you&rsquo;ll absolutely need Dampen Presence to beat blindsense and blindsight. Toss in a little </span><span class="c8">fly</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;to beat tremorsense, and you&rsquo;re well on your way to risk-lite scouting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Insightful Advice:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;In exchange for a few Perform (Oratory) ranks and minimal time investment, you get to give allies a +2 bonus to one skill, all day long. This feat functions best in teams where everyone has a very clearly defined role&mdash;the wizard always makes Knowledge (Planes) checks, the ranger always makes Perception checks, the rogue rolls Acrobatics all the time, etc. You&rsquo;re still likely to surpass them all, you lucky dog.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Measure Foe:</span><span>&nbsp;There are precious few ways to gain access to metainformation in a campaign, but Measure Foe is one of them. If you&rsquo;re ever looking for an indication of how tough a fight is going to be, and what tricks enemy martials might pull out of their scabbards, Measure Foe is a great feat to have on board. Do note that the Sense Motive DC is going to be </span><span class="c8">very</span><span>&nbsp;high, so you&rsquo;ll likely want both the Expanded Inspiration and Empathy investigator talents to improve your odds, as well as </span><span class="c8">perceive cues.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Open Conduit:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Conduit feats are among the more powerful feats in Pathfinder, and I&rsquo;ve reviewed a number of them here. Open Conduit is a great way to use those feats more often.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Scrutinize Spell:</span><span>&nbsp;Access to meta-information like this is valuable and rare. You&rsquo;ve got free inspiration to Spellcraft checks, so why not use it?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Esoteric Advantage:</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">I really wish the bonus scaled with your level. Even at its static level, Esoteric Advantage gives you a bonus on Knowledge checks that you&rsquo;ll make (and pass) in literally every encounter. Hard to say no to that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Esoteric Linguistics:</span><span>&nbsp;Assuming that you&rsquo;re going with the </span><span class="c12 c6">Skill Focus (Linguistics) + Orator combo,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;you&rsquo;ll already be most of the way there to using Esoteric Linguistics. It&rsquo;s another nice way to be able to cast high-level scrolls without having to worry about UMD, although you could get there more easily through Divine Deception.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Master of Knowledge:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Many investigators will want to worship Irori in order to access his amazing Deific Obedience, so it&rsquo;s conceivable that you might also take Skill Focus and then want to progress to Master of Knowledge. It&rsquo;s a fairly tame benefit, but auto-succeeding at a crucial monster identification 1/day might be worth it to you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Street Smarts:</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;</span><span>Street Smarts doesn&rsquo;t win any feat awards, being essentially the same as other +2/+2 feats like Deceptive or Alertness. What it </span><span class="c8">does</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;do is open you up to take the Measure Foe feat, which I&rsquo;ll detail above.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Uncanny Activation:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Investigators use UMD quite a lot (or they should, anyway) so it can be nice to get that skill expertise rewarded with CL boosts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Xenoglossy:</span><span>&nbsp;A cool feat that can eliminate the need for </span><span class="c8">tongues</span><span>, but recommended only for </span><span class="c12 c6">Orator builds.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c6">Dilettante:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;If Knowledge bonuses are what you&rsquo;re angling for, use Deific/Fey Obedience or Breadth of Experience, not Dilettante. Talk about a feat with a limited shelf-life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c6">Ironclad Logic:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;You&rsquo;d think this would be a decent ability for investigators who want to be the party face, but truthfully, the Student of Philosophy trait does much better, and with less investment. And holy cow, those Intelligence requirements! How smart do they think you&rsquo;re going to be!?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c6">Masked Renown:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Flavorwise, it&rsquo;s very cool, but the bonuses are small and only work while in your &ldquo;masked persona.&rdquo; Look at Spirit-Ridden if you want something mechanically stronger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c6">Noble Scion (Lore):</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Even if you wanted a bonus this small, you have many, many better options available through Breadth of Experience or Deific/Fey Obedience. Go for those.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h3 class="c0 c5" id="h.18ai34oqzvr4"><span class="c37">Demoralize</span></h3><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c35 c6">Signature Skill (Intimidate):</span><span>&nbsp;Very few methods of demoralization allow you to skip straight over the shaken condition to frightened, panicked, or cowering. But this is that method. You absolutely </span><span class="c8">must</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;take Signature Skill if you want to be effective at making monsters poop themselves with fright.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Bludgeoner/Stage Combatant + Enforcer:</span><span>&nbsp;Assuming you can figure out a way to consistently deal nonlethal damage (a </span><span class="c8">merciful </span><span class="c1">weapon, Stage Combatant, Sarenrae&rsquo;s Divine Fighting Technique, the Bludgeoner feat plus a morningstar, etc.) then Enforcer is absolutely the most efficient demoralization method on the market.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Cornugon Smash:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re a Strength-based melee investigator, Cornugon Smash is likely your best bet for demoralizing individual enemies. The duration isn&rsquo;t nearly as good as Enforcer, but it is what it is.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Dazzling Display:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Weapon Focus has always been an unfortunate feat tax for Dazzling Display, but otherwise, it&rsquo;s an excellent tool for when the normally self-focused investigator wants to help the team out. Especially if you&rsquo;re rocking the Intimidate Skill Unlock, Underworld Inspiration, Bruising Intellect, etc., there&rsquo;s no reason you shouldn&rsquo;t be regularly pumping out the frightened and panicked conditions at later levels.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Disheartening Display:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re going the Dazzling Display route for some area debuffing, you may as well also pick up Disheartening Display, which lets you increase the severity of your fear conditions by one step. Because you can&rsquo;t affect foes with it more than once per day, though, you&rsquo;ll also need the Intimidate Skill Unlock to hit higher fear severities right off the bat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Hurtful:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Attacks made as swift actions whenever you successfully demoralize a creature? Yes, please.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Violent Display:</span><span>&nbsp;This feat was made for weretigers, so check with your GM about whether they&rsquo;re okay with that. If they are, you have </span><span class="c8">carte blanche</span><span>&nbsp;to start crit-fishing and handing out Dazzling Displays like you&rsquo;re on </span><span class="c8">Ru Paul.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Ancestral Scorn:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Tieflings will have to take the Bruising Intellect trait and the Underworld Inspiration talent in order to make much of their innate Intimidate skills, but once you have those, it&rsquo;s generally pretty easy to get going with a demoralize build. Ancestral Scorn gives you the lovely sickened and nauseated conditions on top of your demoralization, making you even safer in a crowded melee scrum.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Equipment Trick (Cloak: Dazzling Trail):</span><span>&nbsp;A nice, method-agnostic increase to the length of your demoralize effects. </span><span class="c8">Plus,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;the feat text doesn&rsquo;t specify that the demoralize effect has to be shaken! If you can manage to get frightened, panicked, or cowering up and running, Dazzling Trail would boost those, RAW.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Shatter Defenses:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Shatter Defenses is merely okay on the investigator, who can&rsquo;t take great advantage of enemies who have lost their Dexterity bonus to AC. But denying Dexterity is a great way to hit more easily, and we like that just fine. Unfortunately, you can&rsquo;t pass that condition out to allied rogues or slayers, so womp womp, little rain cloud.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Gory Finish:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a decent way to proc Dazzling Display, but as an investigator, you&rsquo;re unlikely to be the one to strike the finishing blow that often. You can probably do better with Dazzling Display on its own.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Intimidating Prowess:</span><span>&nbsp;A nice skill boost if you&rsquo;re a </span><span class="c32 c12 c6">Strength-based investigator.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Motivating Display:</span><span>&nbsp;A minor team buff if you&rsquo;re using Dazzling Display regularly. If you&rsquo;ve got a </span><span class="c3 c6">bard or other source of morale bonuses on your team,</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">don&rsquo;t bother.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c32 c12 c6"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c6">Killing Flourish:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Slayer only.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c6">Martial Dominance:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;The crit-fishing part is interesting, but even so, your Intimidate ranks will always be better than your BAB.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c6">Pile On:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Just take your damage.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h3 class="c0 c5" id="h.pk2p194qgb4c"><span class="c37">Non-Magical Healing</span></h3><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c35 c6">Healer&rsquo;s Hands:</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Under normal circumstances, treating deadly wounds takes 1 hour of labor, and a creature can&rsquo;t benefit more than once per day. Healer&rsquo;s Hands therefore allows you to treat deadly wounds 600x faster, without a healer&rsquo;s kit, and multiple times per day on the same creature. If you beat the DC by 10 or more, you restore 1 HP/level of the healed creature + Wisdom modifier (per the base Heal skill text) + Knowledge (Planes) ranks. By 10th level, you can easily be healing 20-25 HP a pop with this ability, making Healer&rsquo;s Hands one of the foundational elements of any Heal build. But wait! We can go further.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Heal Skill Unlock:</span><span>&nbsp;The 10-rank skill unlock makes the base healing of treat deadly wounds 4x more effective, which gets increased to 6x and 12x at 15 and 20 ranks, respectively. The Healer&rsquo;s Hands + Heal Skill Unlock combo increases your healing powers to 4 HP/level of the healed creature + Wisdom modifier + Knowledge (Planes) ranks. At 10th level, we&rsquo;re up to 50-55 HP per treat deadly wounds action; that increases to around 75 HP at 15th level, and 240 HP at 20th level. Yeah. Imagine getting </span><span class="c8">that</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;benefit 20 times per day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Incredible Healer:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Healer&rsquo;s Hands gets the purple rating because it&rsquo;s more powerful past 10 skill ranks in Heal, but before then, Incredible Healer is the better option, especially if you&rsquo;ve been investing heavily in the Heal skill via the Precise Treatment trait, Expanded Inspiration talent, etc. Plus, it leads into Pathologist, which is always nice.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Acupuncture Specialist:</span><span>&nbsp;I wouldn&rsquo;t make this an </span><span class="c8">immediate</span><span>&nbsp;buy, but as you approach the double digits, [curse] effects like </span><span class="c8">insanity</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;will start to become more common&mdash;and more deadly. It&rsquo;s a good buy then, when you can suppress curses at worst, and cure them at best.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Pathologist:</span><span>&nbsp;Given how high your Heal checks will eventually be, Pathologist is game over for any poisons or diseases in your system. Poison gets a little tricky, just because AoE poison effects can&rsquo;t be effectively dealt with in the middle of the battlefield, but overall, Pathologist is still an effective feat for replacing </span><span class="c8">neutralize poison</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c8">remove disease.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c36 c5" id="h.k8hhbc9p0vlz"><span class="c28">Spellcasting &amp; Extracts</span></h2><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Emergency Attunement:</span><span>&nbsp;Much like Numerical Alchemy gives you the chance to respond flexibly with your extract selection, Emergency Attunement lets you switch out an ongoing abjuration or transmutation effect at need. Considering that the </span><span class="c8">vast</span><span>&nbsp;majority of effects on your spell list are abjuration or transmutation, you should be very excited about this. Change a polymorph form at need, swap out a </span><span class="c8">resist energy</span><span>&nbsp;element, pick a new </span><span class="c8">animal aspect!</span><span>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s all possible with a laughably easy Spellcraft check. Special shout-out to Emergency Attunement for allowing you to alter your bonus feat from </span><span class="c8">paragon surge,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;too. As if half-elves needed to be any better.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Flickering Step:</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span>Free </span><span class="c8">dimension door</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is certainly not something that investigators could do before Conduit feats came on the market. Great if you&rsquo;re looking for more battlefield mobility, although you could just as easily take the Portal Seeker archetype.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Wanderer&rsquo;s Fortune:</span><span>&nbsp;Every investigator will learn </span><span class="c8">freedom of movement </span><span>as soon as they possibly can; Wanderer&rsquo;s Fortune is like a free </span><span class="c8">freedom of movement</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;multiple times a day. That&rsquo;s a hilariously good deal.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Heaven&rsquo;s Light:</span><span>&nbsp;And free </span><span class="c8">daylight,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;as well. Take that, darkness tactics.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c6">Equipment Trick (Sunrod: Like the Sun):</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Lamplighters get lots of light spells at their disposal, and hey, look at that, a free improvement to all of those spells!

Having more inspiration available in combat (which can&rsquo;t be made totally free until 19th level) is always a good idea, though, and there are plenty of archetypes that burn inspiration as fuel for other useful effects.

class="c6">Relic Magic</span><span class="c6">:</span><span>&nbsp;Alters alchemy. Even though you trade away your access to alchemist discoveries (a crying shame) relic magic actually kinda gives you the best of both worlds. You </span><span class="c8">prepare</span><span>&nbsp;spells like an extract caster (so, 1 minute to call forth a spell you need) but can </span><span class="c8">cast</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;spells like a normal arcane spellcaster, no Infusion discovery required. As with other archetypes that replace or significantly alter your extract casting, I won&rsquo;t give this a rating; it&rsquo;s simply a different way to play an investigator.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">(1) </span><span class="c12 c6">Item Lore:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Replaces poison lore.

The antiquarian definitely comes out a bit ahead in this trade. Poisons stink, but they&rsquo;re uncommon enough that you don&rsquo;t need to guard against them so scrupulously, especially with </span><span class="c8">neutralize poison</span><span>&nbsp;on your spell list. Curses can be very bad, though, with effects like </span><span class="c8">blindness/deafness, bestow curse, geas/quest, ill omen, </span><span class="c1">and others that can really mess your day up in the hands of determined spellcasters.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">(4) </span><span class="c12 c6">Swift Search:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Replaces swift alchemy.

Wooow. Wow wow wow. Familiars are amazing*in* Pathfinder: at the very least, they grant you the Alertness feat, offer a familiar-specific bonus to skills, saves, or initiative, possess all the skill ranks you possess, and can use their own skills autonomously, which allows you (in essence) free rerolls on a variety of skill checks. They also have improved evasion, SR, and half your HP, so they can be surprisingly resilient if the situation is right.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could speak at length about different familiar archetypes, bonuses that familiars grant, etc., but the fact of the matter is that both the archetypes (Mauler, Protector, and Valet, at least) and the skill/save/initiative bonuses granted by your familiar will go away at 7th level, when you gain Improved Familiar. This is complicated, and a matter of some debate on Paizo boards. Archetypes are reliant on the speak with master and speak with animals of its kind class features, both of which Improved Familiar trades away; sage is still legal, but of limited use when the investigator will already have so many skill ranks to share with their familiar. It&rsquo;s unclear whether celestial/infernal/resolute/entropic animals continue to grant the bonuses that they did during their earlier careers, but you&rsquo;re probably better off switching to an outsider, dragon, magical beast, etc. anyway to grab their unusual movement modes, SLAs, and DR/resistances/immunities.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">(4) </span><span class="c6 c7">Inspired Familiar:</span><span>&nbsp;Replaces 4th-level studied strike damage. The bonded investigator keeps on giving! What&rsquo;s neat about inspired familiar is that all the talents you take that improve your inspiration ability also apply to your familiar. If you get inspiration for free on your skill check, so does your familiar; if you have Combat Inspiration and need to expend only 1 point to get your inspiration die on an attack roll or save, so does your familiar; if you have increased inspiration dice through Amazing Inspiration, Tenacious Inspiration, or the Focused Inspiration feat, so does your familiar. Other expenditures of inspiration, such as Inspirational Expertise, Applied Engineering, or many of the abilities from other investigator archetypes </span><span class="c8">don&rsquo;t</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;apply, however. Paired with familiar archetypes like sage, it can become nearly impossible for an investigator/familiar duo to fail a skill check&mdash;even if one rolls poorly, the other has a decent chance of rolling well.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">(6) </span><span class="c15 c6">Studied Strike:</span><span>&nbsp;Alters studied strike. I&rsquo;m totally fine with this trade. As we&rsquo;ve discussed elsewhere, </span><span class="c8">studied combat</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is what you really can&rsquo;t afford to let go of; studied strike is passably good, but can be a trap if used incorrectly. With the unparalleled versatility and power that a familiar can offer you, you come out waaay ahead in this exchange.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">(7) </span><span class="c6 c7">Improved Familiar:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Replaces 7th-level investigator talent. Improved familiars are a thing of beauty. Even though improved familiars still count as whatever creature type they were prior to their transformation, the rest of their abilities are transmuted into those belonging to fey, outsiders, magical beasts, and more. A complete rundown of all the available familiars is beyond the scope of this guide, but here are a few things to look out for:</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><ul class="c34 lst-kix_f9jze88314c-0 start"><li class="c0 c38 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">DR, resistances, and immunities.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;These never hurt. Remember, however, that immunities based on creature type (outsider, construct, fey, etc.) don&rsquo;t apply because improved familiars retain their old creature type.</span></li><li class="c0 c38 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">Fly speeds.</span><span>&nbsp;Swim, climb, and burrow are also acceptable, but fly speeds reign supreme in later levels. A flying familiar is </span><span class="c8">way</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;easier to send out on a scouting mission than one that can&rsquo;t fly.</span></li><li class="c0 c38 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">Constant or at-will SLAs and auras.</span><span>&nbsp;Cassisian angels can grant you constant </span><span class="c8">protection from evil;</span><span>&nbsp;cacodaemons and nosoi psychopomps can cast </span><span class="c8">invisibility</span><span>&nbsp;at will; paracletus aeons can give you nifty effects like </span><span class="c8">bless</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;on command. Though small, these bonuses can help you out even when your familiar can&rsquo;t do much else in a combat. And we never say no to bonuses, do we?</span></li><li class="c0 c38 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">Truespeech.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Azata, agathions, and angels can all speak with any creature that possesses a language, aeons can use their envisaging power to communicate non-verbally, etc. You never know when these abilities might be useful.</span></li></ul><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h4 class="c0 c5 c10" id="h.hdoihsq6ckvp"><span class="c4">Is It Worth It?</span></h4><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absolutely. At the very least, familiars can always provide either Aid Another actions to help out your skill checks, or simple rerolls through their own skill checks; they always grant Alertness, too. At best, once you have Improved Familiar, you can use your familiar&rsquo;s fly speed, SLAs, innate intelligence, and languages to send them on semi-autonomous missions of their own, using wands and other UMD items to accomplish tasks. You&rsquo;re getting a tremendous amount of power and versatility for a very low cost in this archetype.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h3 class="c0 c5" id="h.1tyvehdkizgr"><span class="c15">Carto</span><span class="c44 c12">grapher</span></h3><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h4 class="c0 c5 c10" id="h.aj8fnnjfbk01"><span class="c4">The Basics</span></h4><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cartographers make maps. &ldquo;As in life, so in art.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a fun little archetype that could stack with natural philosopher to give you some good benefits in a wilderness campaign like </span><span class="c8">Ironfang Invasion,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;but overall pretty unobtrusive.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c20 c6">Versatility: +0</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">Power:</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c32 c12 c6">+1</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">Stacks With: </span><span class="c1">Conspirator, Forensic Physician, Natural Philosopher, Reckless Epicurean</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h4 class="c0 c5 c10" id="h.gkyytwymckv9"><span class="c4">The Abilities</span></h4><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">(1)</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c12 c6">Studied Terrain:</span><span>&nbsp;Replaces poison lore and poison resistance. I really, really like studied terrain. It&rsquo;s easy to use, the radius scales nicely, and the inspiration bonuses all go to skills that you wouldn&rsquo;t normally get free inspiration on. Stealth, Survival, and Acrobatics in particular are nice, as are Swim and Climb, when they&rsquo;re relevant. If you can foresee yourself using inspiration on even one of the included checks, your costs have already broken even, so consider using a map whenever you can. In dungeons, you&rsquo;ll probably want to scout ahead using </span><span class="c8">invisibility </span><span class="c1">wherever possible so that you can actually get your bonuses; the overland map and town map features aren&rsquo;t finicky.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">(3) </span><span class="c12 c6">Geographic Lore:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Replaces keen recollection. Keen recollection pretty much stinks as an ability, so sure, let&rsquo;s become a human compass and sell maps as a side hustle. Will it ever come up?

Monster lore is an excellent inquisitor ability, and totally fitting for investigators, too. Unfortunately, the investigator already has great Intelligence scores, and as monster lore is demonstrably narrower in scope than pure Intelligence for Knowledge checks, I can&rsquo;t think that this ability will ever grant you more than a 1- or 2-point bonus to identify monster weaknesses. Anything&rsquo;s better than poison, though.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">(4) Opportune Advice:</span><span>&nbsp;Replaces studied combat. &ldquo;Replace studied combat,&rdquo; I hear you thinking, &ldquo;are they crazy!?&rdquo; Yes, it&rsquo;s something of a lateral move, but hear me out: opportune advice is actually pretty good, or at least no worse than studied combat, considering the role the cryptid scholar archetype is meant to play. You won&rsquo;t be the star of the show with your rapier crits, but you </span><span class="c8">will</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;be a quiet asset on the back line, ensuring that allies don&rsquo;t fall victim to the most dangerous (Su) and (Ex) abilities on display in encounters. Keep in mind the range of your opportune advice, and be on the lookout for encounters that feature divergent enemy types, as your opportune advice can only coach allies on one enemy type at a time.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">(4) Knowledgeable Strike:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Replaces studied strike. Depending on how many allies you have present on the battlefield, knowledgeable strike can end up being more potent than studied strike by a decent margin. Again, this isn&rsquo;t really better or worse than studied strike, just a fundamentally different way of playing an investigator.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h4 class="c0 c5 c10" id="h.hupqvmfyfauw"><span class="c4">Is It Worth It?</span></h4><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This archetype is one of those rare archetypes that is&mdash;in my opinion, at least&mdash;perfectly balanced. The abilities you get are of exactly the same caliber as those you give up. If you&rsquo;re interested in a support playstyle for your investigator, cryptid scholar is definitely your one-stop shop. No need to look any further.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h3 class="c0 c5" id="h.1njszr98ssbf"><span class="c44 c12">Cult Hunter</span></h3><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h4 class="c0 c5 c10" id="h.5rsnpgukmvy9"><span class="c4">The Basics</span></h4><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cult hunters track down organizations of dangerous people summoning even more dangerous extraplanar entities into the Material Plane.

I&rsquo;d </span><span class="c8">much</span><span>&nbsp;rather have resistance to compulsion effects, wouldn&rsquo;t you? A single </span><span class="c8">dominate person</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;will ruin your day.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">(2) </span><span class="c12 c6">Student of the Beyond:</span><span>&nbsp;Replaces poison lore. These bonuses will be </span><span class="c8">very</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;circumstantial, but they replace the poor poison lore ability, so hey, we&rsquo;ll call it a win.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">(3) </span><span class="c6 c7">Ambush Sense:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Replaces trap sense. Finally, something good! Surprise rounds can be dangerous indeed, but you&rsquo;ll feel far more comfortable with these bonuses. A nice get.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">(4) </span><span class="c12 c6">Cultic Study:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Replaces swift alchemy. I was all ready to dismiss cultic study, but it&rsquo;s actually a mechanically solid ability. Think about it: in, say, the last three books of any Paizo AP you care to name, what percentage of the time are you fighting enemies aligned with a particular deity, demon lord, archdevil, etc., or the more generic &ldquo;extraplanar creatures&rdquo; mentioned in the ability text? I bet it&rsquo;s more than you think. All of these skills are extremely handy to have in the course of everyday adventuring, and last forever, or until you change them. There&rsquo;s more here than meets the eye.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">(4) </span><span class="c12 c6">Cult Combat / Cult Strike:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Replaces studied combat and studied strike. Again, I can&rsquo;t promise that these bonuses will always applicable, what with random encounters, unaligned animals, constructs, magical beasts, undead, etc., but plots need antagonists, and antagonists in Pathfinder are usually associated with some kind of cult, religion, or extraplanar entity. That means you might see your cult combat and cult strike bonuses more often than you think.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">(7) </span><span class="c12 c6">Summoning Sense:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Replaces 7th-level investigator talent. If you&rsquo;re going to lose talents, I&rsquo;d prefer them to be at least at 7th level, so you can pick up Quick Study at 5th and (most likely) an inspiration-enhancing talent at 3rd. Summoning sense won&rsquo;t come up in every battle, but in boss battles (which almost exclusively feature spellcasters) you&rsquo;ll be very happy to have defenses against all the summons that bosses tend to rope in.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">(13) </span><span class="c6 c7">Extraplanar Expulsion:</span><span>&nbsp;Replaces 13th-level investigator talent. The </span><span class="c8">dispel [alignment]</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;suite of spells is powerful and versatile, shunting extraplanar entities back where they came from, shutting down bad enchantment and compulsion effects, and granting you a hefty bonus to AC in the meantime. I&rsquo;m totally fine with this ability.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h4 class="c0 c5 c10" id="h.9tc897qvzui6"><span class="c4">Is It Worth It?</span></h4><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I think so! Your versatility will naturally be a little lower with cult hunter, but the bonuses are powerful enough (and broadly applicable enough to cults, religions, extraplanar entities, etc.) that you won&rsquo;t mind most of the time. Solid B+.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h3 class="c0 c5" id="h.5kqj7dwjrpzo"><span class="c12">Empir</span><span class="c44 c7">icist</span></h3><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h4 class="c0 c5 c10" id="h.b7g3xy69mg0o"><span class="c4">The Basics</span></h4><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Empiricist. It&rsquo;s the archetype that jumps into everyone&rsquo;s mind when you mention the investigator class, and for good reason: it gives up little power from the base investigator chassis, and gains a bunch of power in return, mostly by keying a bunch of your most important skill checks off of Intelligence, rather than other attributes. It&rsquo;s the template for how to do an archetype right in very little space.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">Versatility: </span><span class="c32 c12 c6">+1</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">Power:</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c32 c6 c7">+2</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">Stacks With: </span><span class="c1">Forensic Physician, Natural Philosopher, Reckless Epicurean</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h4 class="c0 c5 c10" id="h.novh6bt80key"><span class="c4">The Abilities</span></h4><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">(2)</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c7">Ceaseless Observation:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Replaces poison lore and poison resistance. Hoooly cow, that&rsquo;s the way to start off an archetype. All four of these skills are rated green or blue in my scheme; Use Magic Device at the very least will save you a trait on Pragmatic Activator, and switching over Perception, Sense Motive, and Disable Device can reduce the need for Expanded Inspiration. And all you have to give up are some lame poison abilities? This is an archetype feature done right.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">(4) </span><span class="c12 c6">Unfailing Logic:</span><span>&nbsp;Replaces swift alchemy. Surprisingly large bonuses vs. illusion magic, with the option to toss in inspiration on the save and eventual immunities. Even if illusions aren&rsquo;t an everyday feature of Pathfinder campaigns, they do come up, and they&rsquo;re often troublesome. And if you ever square off against a full caster using any of the </span><span class="c8">shadow </span><span>suite of spells (</span><span class="c8">shadow conjuration, shadow evocation,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;etc.) you&rsquo;ll be doubly happy to have unfailing logic. Swift alchemy isn&rsquo;t a crushing loss anyway.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">(20) Master Intellect:</span><span>&nbsp;Replaces true inspiration. I&rsquo;d recommend the alternate capstones released in </span><span class="c8">Chronicle of Legends</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;instead of either true inspiration or master intellect, so you shouldn&rsquo;t even count this ability as being part of the empiricist except for determining which archetypes stack.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h4 class="c0 c5 c10" id="h.wrncvkct2wkt"><span class="c4">Is It Worth It?</span></h4><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like I said, the empiricist knows how to get a lot done in a short amount of time.

Before you dive into what makes the archetype so great, I want to stress that you will chug through an insane amount of inspiration while playing as a gravedigger, so it behooves you to meet your immediate combat needs, then focus all your resources on the Extra Investigator Talent and Extra Inspiration feats. They&rsquo;ll take a great archetype and make it even greater.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">Versatility: </span><span class="c32 c6 c7">+2</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">Power:</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c7 c32">+2</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">Stacks With: </span><span class="c1">Nothing</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h4 class="c0 c5 c10" id="h.dlis0gjmcyd6"><span class="c4">The Abilities</span></h4><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">(1)</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c7">Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</span><span>&nbsp;Two upgrades here, one amazing and the other potentially amazing. First, scythes get added to your weapon list. Scythes are amazing, dealing 2d4 damage with a x4 crit modifier. Second, depending on how your GM interprets the clause about being able to &ldquo;fight with gravediggers&rsquo; tools such as a shovel or lantern as if she had the Catch Off-Guard feat,&rdquo; you may qualify for Shikigami Style right off the bat. Get yourself a </span><span class="c8">traveler&rsquo;s any-tool,</span><span>&nbsp;and with Shikigami Manipulation, you can treat that humble </span><span class="c8">any-tool </span><span>as a </span><span class="c8">+2 shovel</span><span>&nbsp;by 5th level. Ruling that it&rsquo;s similar to a warhammer or battleaxe in size and weight, the three effective size increases from the Shikigami Style feat line bring your base damage dice from 1d8 up to 4d6 (1d8 &rarr; 2d6 &rarr; 3d6 &rarr; 4d6). Now, it&rsquo;s also possible to craft weapons with higher caster levels than just what is listed in the item description, so you could easily ask a friend to craft a CL 12 </span><span class="c8">any-tool,</span><span>&nbsp;a CL 16 </span><span class="c8">any-tool,</span><span>&nbsp;a CL 20 </span><span class="c8">any-tool,</span><span>&nbsp;etc., and keep working your way up to new enhancement bonuses. A +</span><span class="c8">5 shovel</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;that deals 4d6+5 damage before any other modifiers is certainly a terrifying thought. This feat combo is available to all investigators, by the way, not just gravediggers, but because gravediggers have the potential to get Catch Off-Guard out of the way with no investment, their entry into the Style feat line is easier.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">(1) </span><span class="c15 c6">Limited Alchemy:</span><span>&nbsp;Alters alchemy and investigator talents. Look, I won&rsquo;t pretend that losing out on alchemist discoveries isn&rsquo;t a huge blow. Mutagen, Combine Extracts, Eternal Potion...base investigators are never at a loss for what to take with their Extra Investigator Talent feats because alchemist discoveries are always available even after they&rsquo;ve run out of worthwhile investigator talents. But we&rsquo;re going to make the most of this, right? You won&rsquo;t need to think about Brew Potion </span><span>or alchemical</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;crafting, because you don&rsquo;t have the tools to take advantage of them anymore. Instead, you&rsquo;ll focus on combat prowess and skill domination with your investigator talents, and you&rsquo;ll still do really well with those roles. You&rsquo;ll also be getting some powers from the occultist class in a little bit, so some of your investigator talents will inevitably go toward improving your focus powers.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">(1) </span><span class="c12 c6">Grave Magic:</span><span>&nbsp;Thematic, if niche abilities for destroying, placating, or communicating with undead creatures. Of them all, I like </span><span class="c8">calm spirit, speak with dead,</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c8">call spirit</span><span>&nbsp;best for their utility in solving puzzles and cracking mysteries open, although </span><span class="c8">expeditious excavation</span><span>&nbsp;can be a lot of fun at lower levels. </span><span class="c8">Rest eternal</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;probably won&rsquo;t come up that much unless you&rsquo;re regularly fighting necromancers, vampires, etc.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">(1) </span><span class="c35 c6">Relic Focus:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Replaces trapfinding and trap sense. Wooow. So we&rsquo;ve had crossovers with the bard (questioner archetype), the inquisitor (jinyiwei archetype), and the psychic (psychic detective archetype), but now we get a crossover with the occultist class! Occultists are really, really cool, and many of their focus powers are incredibly good. Necromancy leans a little too heavily on [mind-affecting] effects, negative energy damage, and the like, but it also has some incredible focus powers for minion masters: necromantic servant and soulbound puppet. Let&rsquo;s review these abilities, including the focus powers you can pick up as investigator talents:</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><ul class="c34 lst-kix_ljxue7etw9kt-0 start"><li class="c0 c38 li-bullet-0"><span class="c16 c6">Base Focus Power</span></li></ul><ul class="c34 lst-kix_ljxue7etw9kt-1 start"><li class="c0 c26 li-bullet-0"><span class="c15 c6">Mind Fear:</span><span>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s ironic that the base focus power of necromancy (a school of magic associated with undead creatures) can&rsquo;t affect undead. </span><span class="c8">Facepalm.</span><span>&nbsp;Against enemies that </span><span class="c8">can</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;be affected by [mind-affecting] fear effects, though, mind fear is decent. It&rsquo;s a worthwhile opening gambit against lower-level minions in larger boss fights, as the frightened condition will peel them away from the fight for a while. Against creatures with higher HD than you, you&rsquo;re better off going with an Intimidate build if you actually want to pass out the shaken condition.</span></li></ul><ul class="c34 lst-kix_ljxue7etw9kt-0"><li class="c0 c38 li-bullet-0"><span class="c64 c6">Focus Powers</span></li></ul><ul class="c34 lst-kix_ljxue7etw9kt-1 start"><li class="c0 c26 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Necromantic Servant:</span><span>&nbsp;Available at 1st level. Wow! Necromantic servant is quite the neat little ability. Skeletons and zombies usually can&rsquo;t last long, but yours get HP, BAB, and damage bonuses that all scale with your level, plus new templates, Teamwork feats, and the ability to restore them instantly to life&mdash;or split them into two creatures. You&rsquo;ll burn through a </span><span class="c8">lot</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;of inspiration this way, so think about taking the Extra Inspiration feat if you want to become a minion master; the payoff is worth it. Also investigate feats like Charnel Soldiers for extra synergy.</span></li><li class="c0 c26 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Soulbound Puppet:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Available at 1st level. One point of inspiration is a very small price to pay for a familiar. Since you get to choose a new form for your familiar each time you use soulbound puppet, you should consider this ability as a means of getting a floating buff to your initiative, skills, saves, etc., as well as the Alertness feat. If you ever need to be suddenly good at something different, just use the ability again.</span></li><li class="c0 c26 li-bullet-0"><span class="c12 c6">Pain Wave:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Requires 7th level. Sickened is generally a better condition than shaken, and with pain wave&rsquo;s AoE targeting, it&rsquo;s superior to mind fear for debuffing. Same [mind-affecting] conditions apply, but it&rsquo;s nice that you get a limited effect even on a successful enemy save.</span></li><li class="c0 c26 li-bullet-0"><span class="c15 c6">Psychic Curse:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Requires 5th level. Some of the effects here are powerful, but there are too many opportunities for successful saves to negate the effects of your curse. I&rsquo;d stick with pain wave and leave it at that.</span></li><li class="c0 c26 li-bullet-0"><span class="c15 c6">Spirit Shroud:</span><span>&nbsp;Requires 3rd level. The number of temporary HP are ultimately negligible; likewise, the resistance bonuses will be easily duplicated by your </span><span class="c8">cloak of resistance.</span><span>&nbsp;On balance, I think you have bigger priorities. Investigate Urgathoa&rsquo;s Divine Fighting Technique if you want temporary HP by the boatload.</span></li><li class="c0 c26 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3 c6">Flesh Rot:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Requires 3rd level. Flesh rot hits harder than many similar touch-range damage spells, but not hard enough to make it better than a full-attack action. Pass.</span></li></ul><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">(2) </span><span class="c6 c7">Deny Death:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Replaces poison resistance and poison immunity. I&rsquo;ll gladly make this trade.

Against higher-level creatures that can summon more of themselves and teleport at will (I&rsquo;m thinking specifically of demons here, but many other creatures can pull these tricks, as well) teleportation warden is actually quite good. Losing investigator talents stinks, as always, but by 13th level your build should be rock solid, so you&rsquo;ll be able to take Extra Investigator Talent with nearly every feat you get.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h4 class="c0 c5 c10" id="h.69s4n2yv39lw"><span class="c4">Is It Worth It?</span></h4><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broadly speaking, yes, and doubly so in a desert-themed game like </span><span class="c8">Mummy&rsquo;s Mask</span><span>&nbsp;or </span><span class="c8">Reign of Fire.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;The loss of investigator talents is the hardest part, but so long as you&rsquo;re only losing one or two, still receive your first talent at 3rd level, and receive something good in return, archetypes can usually shrug the losses off.

I wouldn&rsquo;t advise that you use Improved Sunder on weapons and armor (first, because you&rsquo;ll be pretty bad at it; second, because you&rsquo;ll be destroying your own equipment) but it&rsquo;s plenty good against doors, walls, floors, ceilings, load-bearing pillars, etc. Certainly an upgrade over poison lore, although that&rsquo;s not saying much.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">(2) </span><span class="c6 c7">Structural Insight:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;From where I stand, the 5th- and 11th-level abilities in structural insight are the best, allowing you to progress laterally through the aforementioned doors, walls, floors, and ceilings.

If you&rsquo;re willing to wait that long, battlefield preparation and the later iterations of structural insight are plenty good, but I have reasonable doubts about how much a party will need you, the investigator, to fill the role of battlefield manipulator, as opposed to your resident full caster. This archetype doesn&rsquo;t allow stacking with any of the other top-tier investigator archetypes, so my best advice is to consider very carefully whether the trade-offs (lower studied strike damage, two lost investigator talents) are really worth it to you.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h3 class="c0 c5" id="h.vukmakkol8tb"><span class="c44 c12">Jinyiwei</span></h3><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h4 class="c0 c5 c10" id="h.2iqy9yg0bxky"><span class="c4">The Basics</span></h4><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part-inquisitor, part-investigator, all badass, jinyiwei are secret police that use Wisdom as their main mental and port over features like judgment from the inquisitor class.

Certainly, pumping your Wisdom instead of Intelligence will make your Will save, Perception, and Sense Motive checks much better, but you&rsquo;ll pay for it in skill ranks and Knowledge checks. Neither one is worse, really&mdash;the inquisitor&rsquo;s spell list is mostly based around self-buffing, same as the investigator&rsquo;s.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">(1) </span><span class="c12 c6">Suspicious Mind:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Replaces trapfinding.

It stinks that you progress a few levels behind the inquisitor, but it makes sense that Paizo wouldn&rsquo;t want you to be </span><span class="c8">that</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;powerful.

Because inspiration is applied </span><span class="c8">after</span><span>&nbsp;the d20 is rolled but before the result is revealed, mastermind defense can be used in precisely those clutch moments when you need to nudge a hit down into miss territory. A few inspiration to shrug off the effects of a huge Power Attack hit, a Vital Strike, an attack with grab or swallow whole, etc. is a very small price to pay indeed. With Combat Inspiration, Amazing Inspiration, and Tenacious Inspiration, this ability easily lives up to its royal purple. Make sure you communicate with your GM about when you&rsquo;re considering using this ability so that they can tell you </span><span class="c8">just</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;the result of the d20 roll, not their total.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">(9) </span><span class="c6 c7">Impregnable Mind:</span><span>&nbsp;Replaces 9th-level investigator talent. Another extraordinarily powerful ability from the mastermind! By 9th level you should have the bulk of your priority investigator talents out of the way, which makes impregnable </span><span>mind</span><span>&nbsp;quite the steal. This is the level at which full casters will begin spying on you with </span><span class="c8">scrying, discern location,</span><span>&nbsp;etc., but blanket immunity is a straight-up &ldquo;screw you&rdquo; to all those tactics, plus alignment or lie detection. I always judge powers that replace investigator talents by asking myself, &ldquo;If taking this power weren&rsquo;t compulsory, would I still want to take it anyway?&rdquo; In the case </span><span>of impregnable</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;mind, the answer is a resounding yes.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h4 class="c0 c5 c10" id="h.shu6zvq7m8lp"><span class="c4">Is It Worth It?</span></h4><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, mastermind is a very good archetype.

Although a quiet word takes some getting used to, you could eventually prep allies to make all kinds of skill checks. Note that mastermind also stacks with the cryptid scholar and bonded investigator archetypes, both of which are excellent in their own ways. In particular, the mastermind/cryptid scholar combo opens the door for a team-buffing investigator who&rsquo;s deadliest when he&rsquo;s using his allies as weapons.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h3 class="c0 c5" id="h.gtu0do568zdl"><span class="c15">Natural</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c44 c12">Philosopher</span></h3><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h4 class="c0 c5 c10" id="h.hw23egmdoef1"><span class="c4">The Basics</span></h4><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The natural philosopher is, as the name implies, a nature-based investigator that should get on quite well in survival- and wilderness-themed campaigns like </span><span class="c8">Ironfang Invasion</span><span>&nbsp;or </span><span class="c8">Serpent&rsquo;s Skull.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;This is another archetype that is neither better nor worse than the base investigator, just equipped for different scenarios.

Wait, I&rsquo;m confused. Why would you allow players to use Knowledge (Nature) in place of Craft (Alchemy) and Profession (Herbalism), then grant bonuses to the two skills that got replaced? Am I going crazy? At any rate, any reasonable GM will rule that you simply apply half your class level to Knowledge (Nature) checks that </span><span class="c8">function as</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Craft (Alchemy) and Profession (Herbalism) checks. For example, you get the Knowledge bonus when crafting thunderstones, but not when identifying a type of gunpowder; you get the bonus when gathering herbs, but not when using Profession to earn money in an herbalist&rsquo;s shop during downtime. Getting Infusion isn&rsquo;t free, per se, because you&rsquo;re sacrificing your 3rd-level talent, but there are worse talents you could be shoehorned into.

Wooow, weird. This effect is going to be a lot more niche than trapfinding, but I can&rsquo;t think of another effect that duplicates it in all of Pathfinder. Against very high level enemies, you might be able to </span><span>use hunt</span><span>&nbsp;portal as a janky &ldquo;detect enemy&rdquo; effect, assuming they&rsquo;re carrying </span><span class="c8">bags of holding</span><span>&nbsp;or </span><span class="c8">handy haversacks.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;I feel like I need to rate it red just because of how mechanically specific it is, but I have to say, from a flavor perspective, I love it.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">(2) </span><span class="c3 c6">Resist Teleportation:</span><span>&nbsp;Replaces poison resistance.

Oh, and if you&rsquo;re ever targeted by </span><span class="c8">imprisonment</span><span>&nbsp;(pray to whatever deity your character worships that that doesn&rsquo;t happen, by the way) you&rsquo;ll be glad you </span><span>have resist</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;teleportation.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">(2) </span><span class="c15 c6">Portal Lore:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Replaces poison lore. I could at least envision this ability coming in handy sometimes, and it&rsquo;s better than poison lore. Let&rsquo;s pass over it, because your 4th-level ability is really what we&rsquo;re after.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">(4) </span><span class="c35 c6">Transit Portals:</span><span>&nbsp;Replaces studied strike. </span><span class="c8">Heck. Yes.</span><span>&nbsp;This ability right here, </span><span class="c8">this</span><span>&nbsp;is why you would want to play a portal seeker. Now, you might be saying, &ldquo;Give up </span><span>studied</span><span>&nbsp;strike? Are you insane, Allerseelen?&rdquo; And sure, I can understand the impulse: studied strike is a lot of d6s. But remember that, as discussed in the Class Features section, it&rsquo;s actually </span><span class="c8">studied combat</span><span>&nbsp;that deals most of your damage, at least in the long term. And studied strike is inherently difficult to use well: you have to wait until you&rsquo;re confident that an enemy could be dispatched in one blow, by which time your allies might have killed or mezzed them, they might have </span><span class="c8">dimension doored</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;away, etc. If you mistime it and use it early, those critical studied combat bonuses to hit and damage are gone, gone, gone. With all that considered, you won&rsquo;t be surprised to find out that I consider transit portals to be an extraordinary upgrade over studied strike.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are you getting here? Versatility. Mobility. The ability to respond to changing battlefield conditions with ease. At the bottom of a </span><span class="c8">hungry pit?</span><span>&nbsp;Forget climbing, just portal out of there! Walled off from an ally in desperate need of healing by a </span><span class="c8">wall of force?</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Portal right through it&mdash;it&rsquo;s invisible, after all. Trapped on the other side of difficult terrain? In a narrow hallway with no way to maneuver around an enemy and into a flank? Thrown in prison? Locked out of a key room with a Disable Device check you can&rsquo;t hit? Breaking and entering during a heist or robbery? Need to dodge in under the guard of a Colossal-sized enemy without provoking an AoO? Portals can solve all these problems and more. True, you have to be able to see where you&rsquo;re going and need to be able to take a move action (so no teleporting out of grapples) but that&rsquo;s only a speed bump in the grand scheme of things. One last suggestion, though: talk to your GM about giving you a 5-ft. boost every level, rather than a 10-ft. boost every other level. They&rsquo;re mechanically identical, but the suggested rewrite smooths out your progression a bit and matches the wording of your 11th-level ability, extended portals.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">(11) </span><span class="c6 c7">Extended Portals:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Replaces poison immunity.

I think psychics get one of the coolest, most flavorful spell lists in the game, and I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to learn that they have the most spells that are 100% unique to their class. If you know your campaign will feature some amount of psychic magic, psychic detectives are a cool way to go, neither significantly more powerful nor significantly less powerful than base investigators.

There are any number of advantages and disadvantages to psychic casting&mdash;for example, you no longer need to provide verbal or somatic components for spellcasting, but you </span><span class="c8">do</span><span>&nbsp;need to provide thought and emotion components. You can cast while pinned, but not while frightened; you can cast a spell at a dinner party that a wizard wouldn&rsquo;t be able to without raising eyebrows. In general, psychic casting isn&rsquo;t really better or worse than arcane or divine casting, just different. Make sure you </span><span class="c31"><a class="c14" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/occult-adventures/psychic-magic/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117394992000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1SsiaF4bsdHK3vQEqihle-">read up on psychic casting</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;before jumping all the way into this archetype.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One really, really cool feature (shared with the hunter and warpriest classes) is that the psychic detective is a &#8532; casting class that gets access to </span><span class="c8">every spell on the list of a full caster.</span><span>&nbsp;Bards have their own list, inquisitors have their own list, magi have their own list, but psychic detectives get a huuuge range of possible spells known thanks to their connection to the psychic class. And the psychic spell list is amazing! In spite of getting dumped on as a &ldquo;worse sorcerer,&rdquo; the psychic has a neat niche all of its own. </span><span class="c8">Mind thrust, id insinuation, thought shield, paranoia, analyze aura, intellect fortress, possession, wall of ectoplasm, psychic crush,</span><span>&nbsp;mindscapes, freaking </span><span class="c8">psychic duels</span><span class="c1">...there&rsquo;s just such a lot to love here. Remember, though, that you are still a &#8532; caster with all the limitations that go along with that. Your Intelligence and spell levels will be lower than a full caster&rsquo;s main casting stat and spell levels, which means your save DCs and caster level checks to penetrate spell resistance will all be less effective. Focus primarily on buffing yourself and allies, getting intel with divination magic, etc., and you&rsquo;ll be just fine. Oh! And buy as many wands and scrolls of good psychic spells as you reasonably can. There&rsquo;s a lot of versatility you can leverage out of this kind of spellcasting.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">(2) </span><span class="c12 c6">Psychic Meddler:</span><span>&nbsp;Replaces poison lore, poison resistance, swift alchemy, and poison immunity.

Mmmm. You don&rsquo;t get to add your casting stat to the number of phrenic pool points you get every day; that will limit how cavalier you can be about burning through your pool. Your best bet will be to find cheap phrenic amplifications that affect allies or yourself. Mindshield, Perfect Body, and Psychofeedback are all good picks. It&rsquo;s a real shame that you lose out on your very first investigator talent, as that will prevent you from taking the Extra Investigator Talent feat, Quick Study, etc. until at least 5th level. If you do opt to take another phrenic amplification at later levels (you&rsquo;re allowed one extra as an investigator talent) I would make it Relentless Casting. SR is problematic for &#8532; casters, but that amplification can increase your odds of landing a critical spell at a critical time.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">(3) Investigator Talents:</span><span>&nbsp;Alters investigator talents. It&rsquo;s a shame to lose alchemist discoveries, of course, but you couldn&rsquo;t do anything with them anyway unless you had the other class features from the base investigator. You may wish to give some thought to the Expanded Phrenic Pool feat and the option to gain one extra phrenic amplification&mdash;it&rsquo;s something that sets you apart from other investigators, so you might as well make good use of it.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h4 class="c0 c5 c10" id="h.mfe5qxj9hcib"><span class="c4">Is It Worth It?</span></h4><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much like the questioner or jinyiwei archetypes, whether you become a psychic detective is ultimately down to what kind of caster you want to be: do you want to cast divine spells, arcane spells, extract spells, or psychic spells? The investigator has options for all sorts, and switching out your casting tradition is the real reason why you&rsquo;d consider taking any of these archetypes. If you&rsquo;re in a </span><span class="c8">Strange Aeons</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;game or other campaign featuring lots of psychic magic and bizarre, eldritch happenings, the psychic detective will be both flavorful and mechanically powerful&mdash;you just have to be ready for it to be a little out of its element in other settings.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h3 class="c0 c5" id="h.8rqe7kr1eiwx"><span class="c44 c12">Questioner</span></h3><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h4 class="c0 c5 c10" id="h.xrtch6uw1bdl"><span class="c4">The Basics</span></h4><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s the bard/investigator hybrid everyone wanted!

Again, though, this swap is really a matter of preference. If you prefer alchemy&rsquo;s strategy of self-buffing above all else, don&rsquo;t take this archetype; if you&rsquo;re fine with being more of a team buffer, by all means, come on in. The water&rsquo;s fine. Do note that without bardic performance some of the bard&rsquo;s best spells (</span><span class="c8">saving finale</span><span>&nbsp;or </span><span class="c8">allegro,</span><span>&nbsp;e.g.) won&rsquo;t be worth a thin penny to you. Also note that questioners don&rsquo;t actually get excused from arcane spell failure chance in light armor, as bards do, so you&rsquo;ll either have to go without armor (a wand of </span><span class="c8">mage armor,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;perhaps) or purchase Arcane Armor Training.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">(2) </span><span class="c6 c7">Know-It-All:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Replaces poison lore.

All of the spell-like abilities that you gain through commune with spirits are circumstantial at best, and in return you surrender your entire ability to respond flexibly to situations through extract usage.

So you somehow have to sneak within range to even have a </span><span class="c8">chance</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;of inattention blindness working. What good was this ability?</span></li><li class="c0 c38 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">Target cap.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Another early limitation is that you simply can&rsquo;t hoodwink that many targets with inattention blindness. You&rsquo;ll probably only ever need it for four or five targets, but you&rsquo;ll spend the vast majority of most Paizo APs just trying to get to 11th/14th level, when that becomes possible.</span></li><li class="c0 c38 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">Perception check DC.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Another crucial weakness of inattention blindness is that your DC simply isn&rsquo;t difficult to beat. You have no meaningful means of increasing it, short of buffing your Intelligence (hard to do) or gaining levels on command (impossible to do). Assuming you start with an Intelligence modifier somewhere in the 3-4 range and end with an Intelligence modifier in the 8-9 range (+6 Intelligence headband + 4 Intelligence stat tomes) your DC will be 14-15 at 1st level and 38-39 at 20th level. Want to know what the median Perception scores are for CR 1 and CR 20 creatures? +5 and +35. So enemies at 1st level have a better-than-50-50 chance of spotting you even if they&rsquo;re affected by the aura, and your chances only go down from there.</span></li><li class="c0 c38 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">[Mind-affecting].</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Lastly, because inattention blindness is a [mind-affecting] effect, it simply won&rsquo;t work on a good number of enemies.

The only thing that saves it is the hide in plain sight ability, which you get later on. Thanks to HiPS, it kinda doesn&rsquo;t matter whether your inattention blindness worked or not&mdash;you can just use Stealth to escape notice instead. Good thing, too, as inattention blindness is broken. And not in a good way.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">(3) </span><span class="c6 c7">Evasive:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Replaces 3rd- and 11th-level investigator talents.

Tenuous threat is interesting in that it decouples studied strike from studied combat. Part of me thinks that&rsquo;s cool! Now you can study a main target, lash out at any minions that decide to get close, and hopefully burn a few down. But there are problems. First, you&rsquo;ve now attached a Will save to negate. Dukes! A good half of enemies will succeed at those. Second, your studied strike is now </span><span class="c8">[mind-affecting].</span><span>&nbsp;Double dukes! So in addition to oozes, elementals, and incorporeals, all of which are immune to precision damage, you now also have to worry about constructs, inevitables, qlippoth, plants, undead, and vermin. Third, you don&rsquo;t get to use studied combat&rsquo;s attack bonuses to help you </span><span class="c8">land</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;your studied strike. Triple dukes! Maybe an enemy has really high AC, and you&rsquo;d genuinely like to be able to use studied combat for that purpose. Nuh-uh, you can&rsquo;t. Not much going right here.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">(7) </span><span class="c6 c7">Hide in Plain Sight:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Replaces 7th-level investigator talent.

Inattention blindness doesn&rsquo;t work as intended, and the one archetype that&rsquo;s meant to make you most unfindable is instead likely to get you splattered if you try to use it to sneak around enemies or observe them unseen. It doesn&rsquo;t help that you also trade away damn near all of your investigator talents! I mean, jeez, you get your first one at 13th level? You can&rsquo;t even take Extra Investigator Talent before that to alleviate the pain, because you don&rsquo;t yet have the class feature to satisfy the prerequisite. I&rsquo;d take evasive, HiPS, and even null aura if they were offered to me in a different archetype, but cipher sucks enough to make me back away slowly.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h3 class="c0 c5" id="h.7cmxjd3jy2f8"><span class="c37">Conspirator</span></h3><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h4 class="c0 c5 c10" id="h.y75e4fl65gi5"><span class="c4">The Basics</span></h4><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another vaguely sinister investigator archetype, like Lepidstadt inspector or mastermind.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">Versatility: </span><span class="c32 c15 c6">-1</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">Power:</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c32 c15 c6">-1</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">Stacks With: </span><span class="c1">Antiquarian, Cartographer, Cryptid Scholar, Holomog Demolitionist, Empiricist, Psychic Detective, Sleuth, Steel Hound</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h4 class="c0 c5 c10" id="h.p8dm0v2v75vn"><span class="c4">The Abilities</span></h4><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">(1)</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c15 c6">Underhanded:</span><span>&nbsp;Replaces trapfinding and alters inspiration.

Yeah, me, too.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">(2) </span><span class="c3 c6">Drug Resistance:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Replaces poison resistance and poison immunity.

Again, losing the vast majority of your investigator talents isn&rsquo;t a great way to start. I&rsquo;d say that these were good effects, but because you need to expend both inspiration </span><span class="c8">and</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;10 minutes off of your hallucinogen duration in order to use them, you&rsquo;ll be blowing the one substance you traded everything for&mdash;the hallucinogen. Again, can&rsquo;t recommend.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">(6) </span><span class="c15 c6">Simultaneous Study:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Replaces studied combat and trap sense. Okay, this is actually pretty cool...but you just don&rsquo;t need it. Investigators are fundamentally intended to be single-target attackers, whether in melee or at range, and you have no abilities that would allow you to take advantage of multiple targets at the same time. The limitation of one studied target isn&rsquo;t too restrictive for the base investigator because every investigator will take the Quick Study talent ASAP; you can&rsquo;t do that, however, because you traded away all your talents. Poop.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h4 class="c0 c5 c10" id="h.p05i9l7twrbw"><span class="c4">Is It Worth It?</span></h4><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investigator talents are what shore up the mechanics of the class chassis. Without them, you&rsquo;re sunk. It&rsquo;s okay to give away one or two if the trade is worth it, especially if they come a little later in your progression, but giving away every talent until 13th level for comparatively little in return isn&rsquo;t an acceptable trade.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h3 class="c0 c5" id="h.iyn6worp7o1"><span class="c3">Infil</span><span class="c44 c15">trator</span></h3><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h4 class="c0 c5 c10" id="h.5h0w5qxf1w12"><span class="c4">The Basics</span></h4><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen.

The whole thing is based around becoming better at mundane disguises, which in my history of Pathfinder play I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever seen anyone use. Once.

This ability will prove to be integral to your fettering ability, so I suppose it&rsquo;s important to have. I still think a &frac34;-BAB class using combat maneuvers on the regular is incredibly risky. You&rsquo;ll probably want to invest in Amazing Inspiration and Tenacious Inspiration, then use those liberally when attempting to collect tokens from creatures. More on that in our next ability.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">(1) </span><span class="c3 c6">Fettering:</span><span>&nbsp;Replaces alchemy. So: in exchange for </span><span class="c8">all your casting abilities,</span><span>&nbsp;malice binders get the opportunity to create&hellip;well, not voodoo dolls, exactly, but bits of magical material crafted from parts of their targets&rsquo; bodies that can be used to create a variety of effects. In order to </span><span class="c8">get</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;those parts of your targets&rsquo; bodies, you&rsquo;ll need to be able to steal them, which is why take a bit and take a bit more are class features. Let&rsquo;s take a look at some of the rules text to see what we&rsquo;re getting here, because this ability is a long one.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c67 c10"><span class="c39">A malice binder forgoes alchemy for the study of sympathetic magic that allows him to hinder foes. Fetters rely on the magical resonance of creatures capable of casting spells (spellcasters and creatures with spell-like abilities) which saturates even their hair and clothing. </span><span class="c39 c6">Fetters cannot target a creature with no magical ability.</span><span class="c39">&nbsp;The malice binder </span><span class="c39 c6">knows one fetter at 1st level</span><span class="c45 c48 c39">&nbsp;and gains another at 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter.</span></p><p class="c0 c2 c67 c10"><span class="c45 c48 c39"></span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span>Right off the bat, this isn&rsquo;t what I&rsquo;d call a good set-up. Alchemy and extract casting is incredibly versatile and powerful, but fettering trades it away for </span><span class="c8">one power</span><span>&nbsp;that you can use until 4th level, and only then against </span><span class="c8">magical creatures</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;from whom you&rsquo;ve collected a token. Not. Good.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c67 c10"><span class="c39 c6">Every fetter requires a token taken from his desired target:</span><span class="c39">&nbsp;a few hairs, a lost tooth, nail clippings, a scrap of clothing, or a small treasured possession with some significance. An investigator can obtain a single token in any of the following ways: </span><span class="c39 c6">a successful Sleight of Hand check against an unsuspecting target, a successful steal combat maneuver, or a successful Perception check (DC = 15 + the creature&rsquo;s CR) to search an area his target occupied for at least 2 hours.</span><span class="c39">&nbsp;Malice binders can search such a location for additional tokens, but each subsequent Perception check increases the DC by 5, regardless of success or failure. Tokens rely on the magic that clings to spellcasters and creatures with spell-like abilities; they must be carefully preserved as soon as they are recovered and before they can be used. Preparing a token requires a move action, and</span><span class="c39 c6">&nbsp;a malice binder can maintain one prepared token per class level.</span><span class="c45 c48 c39">&nbsp;Each token can be used only to power a fetter targeting the creature it came from, and it is consumed in the process. At 7th level, the malice binder can instead prepare a token as a swift action.</span></p><p class="c0 c2 c67 c10"><span class="c45 c48 c39"></span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c1">In order to use this incredibly specific fetter against only magical targets, you first have to collect and craft a token. If you&rsquo;re in a dungeon crawl and can find some items relating to the boss lying around, sure, this might not be a big problem. What if you&rsquo;re just traveling through the woods, though, and get hit with a random encounter? Well, you&rsquo;ve got to use the steal maneuver. So that&rsquo;s at least a standard action to steal, plus more if you fail the first time. Then you&rsquo;ve got to craft the token as a move or swift action, and finally activate the fetter as a standard action. Ooookay. Let&rsquo;s see what else this ability has going for it.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c10 c67"><span class="c39">The DC to resist a fetter is equal to 10 + half the investigator&rsquo;s class level + </span><span class="c39 c6">the investigator&rsquo;s Charisma bonus.</span><span class="c39">&nbsp;Activating a fetter is a</span><span class="c39 c6">&nbsp;standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity,</span><span class="c39">&nbsp;and unless otherwise stated the target must be within 30 feet, plus 5 feet per 2 levels. </span><span class="c45 c39 c6">Once a creature has been the target of a specific fetter, it is immune to that effect for 24 hours.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for the </span><span class="c8">piece de resistance,</span><span>&nbsp;the malice binder splits your point buy up with Charisma. Why? Why? Why was this necessary? Now you&rsquo;re forced into a rock-hard-place scenario where focusing on Intelligence shores up your inspiration and studied combat, but focusing on Charisma improves your fetters. This is likely to be the kiss of death for </span><span class="c8">both</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;sets of abilities. Alright, once I can get my blood pressure down into acceptable margins again, we&rsquo;ll take a look at the specific effects of the fetters...which can only target an enemy once per effect in 24 hours. Oh, god, there it goes again. Hang on. Taking my hypertension meds.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><ul class="c34 lst-kix_gq7kfxckitzt-0 start"><li class="c0 c26 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Hexing Shield:</span><span>&nbsp;Even with the bonuses from Hexing Shield not stacking with </span><span class="c8">cloaks of resistance,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;an eventual +8 is a meaty bonus that should be applied to your best frontline fighter. Whichever ally intends to get most up into a caster&rsquo;s face, that&rsquo;s who gets Hexing Shield.</span></li><li class="c0 c26 li-bullet-0"><span class="c12 c6">Witch Compass:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Alright, this could be useful for tracking down a BBEG. There&rsquo;s no save involved, so I&rsquo;m fine with it.</span></li><li class="c0 c26 li-bullet-0"><span class="c15 c6">Divine Dread:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;At later levels, Divine Dread is basically a save-or-suck fetter that can destroy single enemies for the duration of a combat. But oh, wait, the duration is only 1 round if they succeed, and the fear condition is only shaken? Well, good thing you didn&rsquo;t need to sacrifice your other attributes in order to increase your Charisma score. /s</span></li><li class="c0 c26 li-bullet-0"><span class="c15 c6">Shackle:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;You&rsquo;re targeting Reflex, which is at least a little more advantageous as CR tranches roll by, but even so, the save DC to escape will be pitifully low for most creatures.</span></li><li class="c0 c26 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3 c6">Incapacitate:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">As Divine Dread, but the dazzled condition an enemy gets on a successful save is even less effective than the shaken condition. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, these are powerful effects, but your Charisma score will never be high enough to land a failed save.</span></li><li class="c0 c26 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3 c6">Repulse:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Again, the creatures that you&rsquo;re targeting with fetters will be casters, which means they&rsquo;ll have high Will saves matched against your puny Charisma score. How many times do you really think they&rsquo;ll fail this check? Repulse is even worse than Incapacitate, anyway. I&rsquo;d rather blind someone for a bunch of rounds than force them to spend a bit more movement.</span></li><li class="c0 c26 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3 c6">Salting Wounds:</span><span>&nbsp;Strip the flesh! Salt the wounds! No, but all </span><span class="c8">Borderlands</span><span>&nbsp;jokes aside, there&rsquo;s nothing to like here. Deflection bonuses to AC will be handled by the standard Big Six </span><span class="c8">ring of protection,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and they don&rsquo;t stack with each other. Plus you have to sicken your own ally!? What the hell, man?</span></li><li class="c0 c26 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3 c6">Temptation:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Will negates, and even if they fail, fascinated is a weak condition that you wouldn&rsquo;t want to dole out anyway.</span></li><li class="c0 c26 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3 c6">Wrack:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">One round only, and Fortitude negates. Man, what a turd of a class feature.</span></li></ul><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, summing up the fettering class feature: you&rsquo;ve traded away all your alchemical prowess and extract casting in return for fettering. In order to use a fetter, you have to get a token from a magical target (standard action), craft the token (move or swift action), </span><span class="c8">use</span><span>&nbsp;the token (standard action, provokes), and finally hope that your target fails its save. How likely is that? Well, since your save DCs are nonsensically keyed off of Charisma, </span><span class="c8">not very likely.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;In order to be a good ability, fettering would have to work against nonmagical targets, key off of Intelligence, and feature upgraded effects or durations in order to be worth anyone&rsquo;s time. As it stands, fettering is incredibly bad.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">(8) </span><span class="c15 c6">Take a Bit More:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Replaces poison resistance.

On top of the flaming, multicolored dumpster fire that is fettering, there are some truly baffling design choices at play. Why make the malice binder&rsquo;s key stat Charisma, but then not change any of the investigator&rsquo;s Intelligence-based abilities to reflect that? Why make fetters </span><span class="c8">only applicable to magical creatures?</span><span>&nbsp;Why force players to spend </span><span class="c8">at least</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;two rounds stealing, crafting, and using a fetter?

Go play an oracle with the Whimsy mystery if you want this kind of stuff.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">(13) </span><span class="c15 c6">Sympathetic Resistance:</span><span>&nbsp;Replaces 13th-level investigator talent.

If an enemy wizard is blowing you away with evocation magic and you drink an evocation extract (not sure what that would be) then they can always switch to other spell schools to mess you up.

As far as I can gather, you have to decide at the time of preparation who your horoscope applies to (including yourself) and only that person can be the beneficiary of your spell. This opens up a few interesting paths. First, it makes extracts function more or less like spells, negating the need for the Infusion discovery in order to pass out buffs to allies. Second, horoscopes made explicitly for allies can be passed out to activate on </span><span class="c8">their</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;turns, rather than yours. On the downside, you lose your Craft (Alchemy) bonuses, and can&rsquo;t select any of the excellent alchemist discoveries, many of which apply to potions and poisons, not just extracts.

If you&rsquo;re playing with the Background Skills ruleset, it&rsquo;s also one of the best &ldquo;trash skills&rdquo; to invest points in, because it frees up all your ranks from Sense Motive.

Crafting is always good, and Scribe Scroll takes a short enough time that you can reasonably expect to churn out scrolls even while doing hardcore adventuring. I&rsquo;m not sure what it means to &ldquo;use scrolls as if he were an arcane spellcaster&rdquo; means, because you&rsquo;d have to specify which class the investigator qualifies as in order to avoid a Use Magic Device check. Regardless, Horoscopic Scrolls is a good talent. I went back and forth between blue and green, but eventually settled on green. If you can use arcane scrolls without a UMD check, it would definitely rate blue.</span></li><li class="c0 c38 li-bullet-0"><span class="c15 c6">Returning Star:</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span>The </span><span class="c8">returning</span><span>&nbsp;weapon has a couple issues, namely that it doesn&rsquo;t track movement very well.

Dipping usually accomplishes a few things&mdash;the more things, the better the case for the dip.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><ul class="c34 lst-kix_a97ko6cata7r-0 start"><li class="c0 c38 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">Gaining class features that aren&rsquo;t level-dependent.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;The paladin&rsquo;s divine grace class feature, for example, simply adds your Charisma modifier to all your saving throws. You don&rsquo;t need any further levels in paladin to enable the combo, which makes this particular dip attractive for Charisma-based classes.</span></li><li class="c0 c38 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">Smoothing away feat prerequisites.</span><span>&nbsp;This is a big one for investigators, who are generally </span><span class="c8">very</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;short on feats. Many classes grant one or more bonus feats at 1st and 2nd level&mdash;the monk is a good example. If a dip can plow down many of the feat prerequisites you&rsquo;ll need for your build, the tradeoff you make in lost class features from your main class can be worth it.</span></li><li class="c0 c38 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">Weapon or armor proficiencies.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;This is another fairly big one for investigators, who get access to only a few martial weapons, light armor, and no shields. If you&rsquo;re playing a Strength-based melee investigator, for example, you&rsquo;ll likely want to invest less in Dexterity, but that means your AC will suffer unless you&rsquo;re able to use medium or heavy armor. A one-level dip in fighter can solve that!</span></li><li class="c0 c38 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">BAB or saves.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;BAB and saves are somewhat incidental when considering a dip&mdash;nice if it happens, but not necessary. Again using a one-level fighter dip, we can see that a Strength-based investigator would be able to grab Power Attack at 1st level (since the fighter&rsquo;s BAB at 1st level is +1) instead of waiting until 3rd level like they would have if they had gone with only investigator levels.</span></li></ul><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the general parameters of dipping set up, what kinds of classes should we be looking into for our investigators?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><ul class="c34 lst-kix_yo0w5jxez7vo-0 start"><li class="c0 c38 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Inspired Blade Swashbuckler 1:</span><span>&nbsp;This is probably the most iconic dip for any investigator who wants to use Weapon Finesse with a rapier to attack using Dexterity instead of Strength. The main purpose of this dip is #2, as the inspired blade archetype grants free Weapon Finesse and Weapon Focus (Rapier) at 1st level, which then allows you to use your remaining 1st-level feat to pick up Fencing Grace and add Dexterity to damage. There&rsquo;s a lesser element of #1: getting a panache pool lets you use Opportune Parry and Riposte a decent number of times per day; investing in crit-fishing tools like Improved Critical or the </span><span class="c8">keen</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;weapon enchantment will let you replenish that pool more easily.</span></li><li class="c0 c38 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Fighter 1:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;No need to monkey around with archetypes in the fighter class. You&rsquo;re here for the bonus feat at 1st level, the better BAB and Fortitude save, and the weapon/armor proficiencies. It&rsquo;s a particularly good dip for Strength-based melee investigators, who will want all of those things.</span></li><li class="c0 c38 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Occultist 1:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;This is another great dip for Strength-based investigators, as one level of occultist grants you +2 to your Fortitude save, medium armor and martial weapon proficiency, a couple cantrips and 1st-level spells, and two implement schools. It&rsquo;s a great little package that adds more versatility than a fighter dip, at the expense of fewer HP, lower BAB, and no bonus feats. The real power of the occultist lies in their implement schools, though, so here are my recommendations:</span></li></ul><ul class="c34 lst-kix_yo0w5jxez7vo-1 start"><li class="c0 c26 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Transmutation:</span><span>&nbsp;This is the real winner. We&rsquo;re looking for effects that last minutes/level, are available at 1st level, and continue to have good effects even when not upgraded. Transmutation fits that brief. Physical Enhancement gives you better physical stats, Legacy Weapon is perfect for grabbing a </span><span class="c8">ghost touch</span><span>&nbsp;or </span><span class="c8">bane</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;weapon when you really need it, and Philosopher&rsquo;s Touch (my recommendation for your free focus power) is aces at overcoming rarer DR types.</span></li><li class="c0 c26 li-bullet-0"><span class="c12 c6">Enchantment:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Glorious Presence is decent for boosting your UMD checks, or face skills if you&rsquo;re not going with an Orator build. Inspired Assault is the perfect match for our fledgling occultist, though: lasts 1 minute, provides a decent bonus even at 1st level, and doesn&rsquo;t rely on any failed saves.</span></li><li class="c0 c26 li-bullet-0"><span class="c15 c6">Evocation:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Light Matrix is a decent utility power for investigators, who (barring the lamplighter archetype) don&rsquo;t otherwise receive access to light cantrips. Still not what I would call excellent, though.</span></li><li class="c0 c26 li-bullet-0"><span class="c15 c6">Necromancy:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;You&rsquo;re here for Soulbound Puppet, which grants you a familiar for 10 minutes. Not fantastic, but also not nothing. Familiars can be very useful, even for short periods.</span></li></ul><ul class="c34 lst-kix_yo0w5jxez7vo-0"><li class="c0 c38 li-bullet-0"><span class="c12 c6">Pistolero/Musket Master Gunslinger 5:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Dipping this far into a class isn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;dip,&rdquo; per se, but for investigators looking to use guns, it&rsquo;s really the only way to do so safely: you need to be able to full-attack, and the only way to do that is to drop reload times down to reasonable levels. Only these two archetypes can give that to you. I&rsquo;d suggest the jinyiwei investigator archetype with this &ldquo;dip&rdquo; in order to conserve your casting stat.</span></li><li class="c0 c38 li-bullet-0"><span class="c15 c6">Oracle 1:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Several mysteries offer revelations that grant great bonuses at 1st level&mdash;I&rsquo;m thinking things like Temporal Celerity or War Sight from the Time and Battle mysteries. It&rsquo;s not an ideal dip, especially given the Charisma/Intelligence mismatch, but it is there.</span></li><li class="c0 c38 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3 c6">Alchemist 1:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;This dip is a trap, unfortunately. You&rsquo;ve got cool class features like mutagen and bombs, all of which are still very useful for investigators, but they&rsquo;re dependent entirely on alchemist levels. Dips ain&rsquo;t about class features that rely on class levels.</span></li><li class="c0 c38 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3 c6">Rake/Thug Rogue 3:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Most of these effects are reproducible through feats or traits without needing to resort to dipping. Demoralize builds are kind of a niche investigator function anyway.</span></li></ul><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c36 c5" id="h.yfvl5n69t7fq"><span class="c28">Variant Multiclassing</span></h2><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduced in Pathfinder Unchained, Variant Multiclassing (or VMC, for short) allowed players to progress two classes in parallel, rather than in sequence. The price&mdash;there&rsquo;s always a price&mdash;is most of your feats. Womp womp. For classes like fighter, where feats aren&rsquo;t a problem, VMC can be an excellent adjunct to your class abilities, giving you new tools for little overall penalty. The issue with VMC and investigators is that investigators receive no bonus feats, and are already incredibly feat-hungry: you&rsquo;ll be sucking down as many instances of Extra Investigator Talent as you can manage whenever you&rsquo;re on a break from your main combat build priorities. Unfortunately, I simply can&rsquo;t recommend VMCing away from the investigator for anyone. You&rsquo;re just spread too thin. And because the investigator is a hybrid class, you can&rsquo;t VMC </span><span class="c8">into</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;investigator, either! How fun.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c36 c5" id="h.2rspaz70eqi1"><span class="c28">Gestalt Builds</span></h2><p class="c36 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span>Gestalt character creation is a process that essentially combines all the class features and casting capabilities of two classes, and is typically done when PCs need to be extra powerful, as when an adventure path designed for a four-person party is only being run by two or three PCs. </span><span class="c31"><a class="c14" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.d20srd.org/srd/variant/classes/gestaltCharacters.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117395093000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0WXa7Xi0nIgv5egx87L6pB">Complete rules can be found here.</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s not terribly difficult to pick a gestalt class, because anything you choose isn&rsquo;t a trade-off so much as an addition. That said, there are choices that maximize what investigators can already do, so in this section we&rsquo;ll detail general precepts for what you should be looking out for in a gestalt pairing.</span></p><p class="c0 c2 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><ul class="c34 lst-kix_1e7lyj9ip0e9-0 start"><li class="c0 c38 li-bullet-0"><span>First and foremost, </span><span class="c6">we&rsquo;re looking for a partner class that benefits from a high Intelligence score. </span><span class="c1">The point buy rules at your table may vary, but many GMs will not budge on 20-point buy, which means that you have to find a class that makes the most of the stats that you&rsquo;ll already be boosting: Intelligence, Constitution, and either Dexterity or Strength.</span></li><li class="c0 c38 li-bullet-0"><span>Second, </span><span class="c6">our partner class should patch the investigator&rsquo;s weaknesses.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;A d8 hit die is one such weakness; a weak Fortitude save, &frac34; BAB, and the absence of bonus combat feats might be other areas to consider shoring up.</span></li></ul><p class="c0 c2 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let&rsquo;s start out with what you&rsquo;re </span><span class="c8">not</span><span>&nbsp;allowed to do. The investigator is a hybrid of the </span><span class="c3 c6">alchemist</span><span>&nbsp;and the </span><span class="c3 c6">rogue</span><span>&nbsp;classes, so as fun as it would be to have an alchemist/investigator crossover, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s something that most GMs would permit at their tables. By all means, try! The alchemist&rsquo;s bombs and discoveries plus the investigator&rsquo;s inspiration and studied combat would make for an insane and volatile mixture. Moving on from those classes, there are any number of full casters that use Intelligence as their main casting stat: </span><span class="c12 c6">witch, wizard, arcanist, sage bloodline sorcerer,</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c12 c6">psychic</span><span>&nbsp;all fit the bill just fine. Here you begin running into a few problems, however. For starters, </span><span>there&rsquo;s arcane</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;spell failure chance. Investigators aren&rsquo;t huge on armor, true, and Dexterity-based investigators can make do with a haramaki, which has no spell failure chance. The slightly bigger problem, however, is one of feats. Casters generally need a lot of feats in order to be effective. Combat Casting, Spell Focus, Spell Penetration, various metamagic feats...it starts to add up. That&rsquo;s not a big problem for casters, who have no other combat priorities, but because the investigator was built to be a striker class, you&rsquo;re left suddenly doing double duty on feats&mdash;and you don&rsquo;t have that many to begin with. Even with no investment, full casters will still be very powerful, but I wouldn&rsquo;t call it an optimal choice.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With full casters a suboptimal choice, let&rsquo;s move to the opposite side of the spectrum: full-BAB martial classes with no innate casting. The advantages here are numerous: martial classes often get bonus feats (one of the investigator&rsquo;s biggest weaknesses), come with attack and damage bonuses that synergize extraordinarily well with studied combat, and boast higher HD and Fortitude saves than the investigator can bring by itself. Let&rsquo;s start simple with the </span><span class="c35 c6">fighter.</span><span>&nbsp;If that seems like a surprising pairing, just think about it for a second: fighters have poor out-of-combat utility, where investigators excel. Investigators are perpetually strapped for feats, which fighters provide in spades. Fighters struggle to compete when magic is afoot, but the investigator </span><span>has extract</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;casting to handle that. Investigators feel pretty squishy with a d8 HD, poor Fortitude saves, and light armor proficiency only, but the fighter neatly solves all of those problems. Weapon training and studied combat are a match made in heaven, letting you take four iterative attacks (+35/+30/+25/+20 without any attribute, gear, or spell bonuses) at 20th level, and the bonus feats let you build whatever the hell you want for your combat chassis. If you have no other priorities, select Extra Investigator Talent over and over and become the world&rsquo;s best skill monkey. Oh, and advanced weapon training? You could just die from how good those are, right?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re looking for something a little more lithe, the </span><span class="c6 c7">inspired blade swashbuckler</span><span>&nbsp;also does very well for itself. A one-level dip in this archetype is classic for Dexterity-based investigators, but the rest of the archetype continues to do good work in a gestalt game. You don&rsquo;t receive as many bonus feats as the fighter, and lose your good Fortitude save, but some will feel that the addition of nimble, charmed life, and your various swashbuckler deeds compensates you for the loss. Your inspired strike class feature&rsquo;s bonus type unfortunately conflicts with studied combat, but that is what it is. Moving on from the swashbuckler, we&rsquo;ve got the</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span class="c15 c6">siege gunner gunslinger.</span><span>&nbsp;Unfortunately, siege gunner just isn&rsquo;t that great of an archetype. You&rsquo;ll get to keep your Intelligence focus, but at the cost of much of what makes a gunslinger powerful. It wouldn&rsquo;t be my first choice, because after all, who&rsquo;s ever used a siege gun in Pathfinder? </span><span class="c6 c7">Slayer</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;</span><span>usually does well in gestalt match-ups, and the match-up with the investigator is no different. One problem that you&rsquo;ll have to work around is the action input to </span><span>use studied</span><span>&nbsp;target and studied combat&mdash;both will require swift actions after a certain point, so it might take you a round or two to get fully buffed up against a single target. If you&rsquo;re willing to make that sacrifice (or work around it with the Domino Effect investigator talent) the class rocks as hard as ever. </span><span class="c6 c7">Brawler</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;</span><span>is also an interesting choice, surprisingly stat-agnostic and extremely flexible. Between your extract casting and martial flexibility, this gestalt pairing is probably the heaviest on systems mastery that anyone could come up with; bonus feats and brawler&rsquo;s cunning can do a lot to clear your path, though. </span><span class="c6">Dark elementalist kineticist</span><span>&nbsp;is an option for basing the kineticist off of Intelligence, but I don&rsquo;t know enough about the kineticist class to make a call on whether it makes a good pairing or not. It&rsquo;s restricted to evil alignments only; that might be more than enough to steer you away.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By this point, we&rsquo;ve moved down into other &#8532; casting classes. These classes won&rsquo;t provide any improvements in BAB or HP, but the addition of yet another casting chassis on top of the investigator&rsquo;s can make for some potent combos. Let&rsquo;s start with one of my favorites: </span><span class="c6 c7">occultist.</span><span>&nbsp;Focus powers and implement schools can be monstrously powerful, and it&rsquo;s generally agreed upon that there&rsquo;s very little a well-prepared occultist can&rsquo;t do. The addition of the Trappings of the Warrior panoply also introduces some potential for a full-BAB occultist. Very cool. </span><span class="c35 c6">Magus</span><span>&nbsp;needs a shout-out, of course. Between qualifying for fighter feats, spellstrike/spell combat, magus arcana, scaling armor proficiencies, a good Fortitude save progression, and the many benefits of an arcane pool, magi are definitely equipped where investigators need it most. Magi also have some unique archetypes available to them&mdash;hexcrafter, bladebound, kensai, eldritch archer, greensting slayer, jistkan artificer...the list goes on. The </span><span class="c12 c6">living grimoire inquisitor</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c12 c6">chronicler of worlds bard</span><span>&nbsp;are archetype-specific options that change the normally Wisdom- and Charisma-based inquisitor and bard classes to an Intelligence-based class. Unlike the occultist or magi classes, which can be dealt with flexibly thanks to their reliance on Intelligence, only these archetypes will be viable for an investigator gestalt, which makes the pairing a little less exciting. Both archetypes give up important class features (judgment, cunning initiative, and monster lore for the living grimoire; versatile performance, bardic knowledge, and one or two good bardic performances for the chronicler of worlds) in exchange for features that you may or may not find useful. They&rsquo;re still good, just not as good as an occultist or magus gestalt. Lastly, there&rsquo;s the </span><span class="c15 c6">warlock or cabalist vigilante.</span><span>&nbsp;Neither of these is a </span><span class="c8">terrible</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;pick, but they&rsquo;re trying so hard to be a magus that I think you might be better off just going magus.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">Jinyiwei bonus round!</span><span>&nbsp;I won&rsquo;t devote as much space to these jabronis, but moving the class over to a Wisdom base lets you consider some different pairings. </span><span class="c6 c7">Hunter, gunslinger, warpriest, inquisitor, ranger, druid, shaman,</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;</span><span>and </span><span class="c6 c7">cleric</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">are all pretty wonderful pairings in their own ways. Shaman, druids, and clerics scratch the full casting itch, rangers can provide great bonus feats (although really, why not just go slayer?), and hunters, inquisitors, and warpriests all make good complements to the investigator&rsquo;s innate talents. And hey, gunslinger can make a ranged investigator good, finally!</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c36 c5" id="h.58d71iqrst1r"><span class="c28">Prestige Classes</span></h2><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve grown a bit tired of the extensive write-ups I do on prestige classes. They can be powerful, to be sure, but most newer players will never touch </span><span>prestige classes</span><span class="c1">, and veteran players usually know the relative merits of the prestige classes they&rsquo;re investigating. Nevertheless, I&rsquo;ll do a brief write-up here in the interest of completeness. We&rsquo;re just gonna go alphabetically!</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c12 c6">Brewkeeper</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">is where we&rsquo;ll start; you can enter by 6th level. The prestige class was designed almost exclusively for the alchemist class, and while the investigator can qualify for it through many of the same class features as the alchemist has, certain abilities like harmful homebrew don&rsquo;t work out as well for investigators as they do for alchemists. The main draw of the prestige class is that it allows you to add metamagic effects to your extracts, then pass them out to allies for free; the potion master ability is also fantastic for crafting-focused investigators, as it acts as a free Enhance Potion anytime you want it. Five or six levels will be enough to get what you want from the class, taking Extend Spell at 2nd level, Heighten Spell at 4th, and Maximize (if you get there) at 6th.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next up, </span><span class="c6 c7">Chernasardo Warden.</span><span>&nbsp;This one was designed specifically for the </span><span class="c8">Ironfang Invasion</span><span>&nbsp;campaign, and it&rsquo;s got some pretty heavy Nirmathas flavor&mdash;there&rsquo;s no reason a Chernasardo Ranger would be in Osirion for a </span><span class="c8">Mummy&rsquo;s Mask </span><span>campaign, for example. If you can work with that flavor, though, the prestige class is excellent, granting you bonus feats, SLAs, Will save bonuses vs. [mind-affecting] and (compulsion) effects, and, perhaps most importantly, five levels of investigator progression even as you gain ten levels of prestige class progression. Your extracts and talents will suffer, but what you gain from the class is more than worth it. I know I&rsquo;m skipping here, but </span><span class="c6 c7">Mortal Usher</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is very similar to Chernasardo Warden&mdash;mechanically, at least&mdash;and similarly powerful. Mortal usher is a little easier to work into an average campaign than Chernasardo warden, which is always a perk. Chernasardo warden can be entered at 8th level (assuming you didn&rsquo;t dip any other full-BAB classes) but mortal usher is doable by 7th.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c15 c6">Daggermark Poisoner</span><span>&nbsp;is on deck. I don&rsquo;t know a great deal about poisons, other than to say that investigators don&rsquo;t receive all the necessary elements of a poison build on their own. Honestly, you&rsquo;re probably best off building an alchemist if poisoning is your goal, but daggermark poisoner can help you ease the strain if you&rsquo;re dead-set on having an investigator slip cyanide into someone&rsquo;s dinner. I&rsquo;ll leave a link to the </span><span class="c31"><a class="c14" href="#h.bob42r3xga9u">poison section of this guide,</a></span><span>&nbsp;which will refer you to </span><span class="c8">other</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;guides more specifically focused on poisoning. If you decide this prestige class is for you, entry is possible by 6th level, although you&rsquo;ll surrender all your class features and casting to do so.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">Evangelist</span><span>&nbsp;is a fun prestige class, mostly because of the aligned class feature that it gets, which allows you nine full levels of your base class progression while also giving you </span><span class="c8">ten</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;levels of prestige class progression. The evangelist&rsquo;s class features, BAB, saves, etc. aren&rsquo;t anything to get excited about, so the real draw here will be the boons your deity grants from the Deific Obedience feat. If the boons are excellent, evangelist will be excellent; if they suck, evangelist will suck. Entry is easy by 6th level.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c12 c6">Hinterlander</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is a bit of an unusual choice, but one that I&rsquo;m sticking by for ranged investigators, who are hampered more than anything by the vast bevy of feats they need to be effective. I can&rsquo;t honestly recommend that you invest more than five levels in hinterlander&mdash;it&rsquo;s enough to get all the bonus feats you need, and no more. You can take your pick for 1st-level archery feats (Rapid Shot would be best) but 3rd and 5th levels should be taken up with Improved Precise Shot and Point-Blank Master or Pinpoint Targeting, respectively. Entry isn&rsquo;t super easy, given the Endurance and Weapon Focus requirements; you&rsquo;ll probably need to play as an elf in order to get longbow proficiency, then spend your first three feats on PBS, Weapon Focus, and Endurance in order to enter by 6th level.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c7">Master Chymist</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;really only ever gets recommended to alchemists, and it&rsquo;s a brutally effective prestige class for those who want to lean into mutagen usage and melee carnage. Investigators will mostly use master chymist levels to qualify for the Greater and Grand Mutagen discoveries, which aren&rsquo;t normally on their list of allowed alchemist discoveries. Nimble, Growth Mutagen, Evasion, and Extended Mutagen are also great. You&rsquo;ll be giving up most of your skill dominance as a master chymist, but the trade-off in Fortitude saves, BAB, HP, and scary damage in melee may be worth it to you. Entry is possible by 8th level, and you won&rsquo;t want to wait too much longer after that to jump in&mdash;you have to suck the marrow out of this class ASAP.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c15 c6">Sleepless Detective,</span><span>&nbsp;in spite of a name that makes it sound like it should be </span><span class="c8">built</span><span>&nbsp;for investigators, actually feels far more like a rogue prestige class. Eh, okay. This is a cool flavor match with many investigator archetypes, but unfortunately, I can&rsquo;t recommend more than one level to scoop canny sleuth (Intelligence modifier to Perception and Sense Motive checks), forensic thaumaturgy (at-will </span><span class="c8">detect magic</span><span class="c1">), and +1d6 sneak attack.

This is perfect for whipping up every brew you could ever need.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Chalice of Communal Dweomer (None, CL 7, 3750 gp):</span><span>&nbsp;Simple way to buff the entire party with things like </span><span class="c8">barkskin, heroism,</span><span>&nbsp;etc. Because they&rsquo;re typically crafted at low caster levels, many potions wouldn&rsquo;t last long enough for more than one fight anyway. So why not take advantage of that by </span><span class="c8">really</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;making it last only a minute or two, but buff multiple people on the team?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c7">Formula Alembic (None, CL 3, 200 gp):</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;If you can find potions, you can turn &lsquo;em into the formulae you&rsquo;ll need to prepare those potions as extracts.

This wouldn&rsquo;t be my first choice of enchantment, but it&rsquo;s nice if you find yourself needing to parry a lot. It probably goes down in usefulness as levels go by, both because you&rsquo;ll be able to afford higher enhancement bonuses on your own and because the deed will start to take penalties against larger enemies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c6">Cunning:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s kinda like a free (and even upgraded) Critical Focus for skill ranks you&rsquo;ll already have!

You&rsquo;ll notice there&rsquo;s a lot of dipping and prestige class builds here; although this might be more difficult to new players to grok, I meant what I&rsquo;ve said throughout this guide that the investigator class is </span><span class="c8">very</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;strapped for feats. Because their armor and weapon proficiencies aren&rsquo;t exactly hot-ticket items, either, many times a one-level dip makes sense where it can gain us outsized benefits for little lost in studied combat bonuses or extract casting. I&rsquo;ve again arranged these builds by what combat role they&rsquo;re meant to fulfill: Dexterity-M indicates a melee build that uses Dexterity to attack via Weapon Finesse and Fencing Grace; Strength-M indicates a melee build that dons heavier armor, pumps Strength, and attacks the old-fashioned way; Dexterity-R indicates a ranged build. Ranged builds are really hard for investigators, but I am going to try to put up my take on a firearm investigator at some point. Spoiler alert: it will not feature the steel hound archetype.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span

come up with for the investigator chassis. Let&rsquo;s start with initiative: ya boi&rsquo;s freaky fast. Between Ambush Training, a high natural Dexterity score, and the later iterations of ready for the revelation giving you your Intelligence to initiative in addition to your Dexterity, you&rsquo;re primed to act before most enemies, guaranteed. If you get your surprise round, quaff your mutagen</span><span class="c8">,</span><span>&nbsp;then charge an enemy on your first round, using Quick Study as a swift action to bring your studied combat bonuses online. Full-attacks with Fencing Grace and studied combat should have the enemy panting before long! If your opponent is a spellcaster or ranged attacker, you&rsquo;re in for even more fun: there&rsquo;s a good magehunter baked into this build. Step Up and Following Step give you all the mobility you need to follow 5-foot steps and take AoOs, and Atheist Inspiration and Focused Belief beef up your defenses.

The first build goal is to get </span><span class="c8">everything we can</span><span>&nbsp;keyed off of Intelligence, and empiricist makes this criminally easy: between our traits, ceaseless observation, and Orator, we can use our Intelligence modifier in one way or another on Disable Device, Perception, Sense Motive, Use Magic Device, Intimidate, Heal, Diplomacy, and Bluff checks by 3rd level. Not bad, eh? From there on out, we use our investigator talents and favored class bonuses to buff or expand our inspiration rolls, mostly with the goal of improving how we use Intimidate. Why? Well, the next half of the build focuses on being very, very scary in combat. Dazzling Display is the immediate need in order to debuff crowds of enemies, although we quickly follow it with Signature Skill: Intimidate and Disheartening Display in order to escalate fear conditions as quickly as we can. Enforcer is a nice, late-game pick that will pair with a </span><span class="c8">merciful</span><span>&nbsp;rapier to enhance your single-target demoralization game. In social scenarios, we&rsquo;re pretty much guaranteed dominance thanks to Orator, Skill Focus (Linguistics), and our various inspiration buffs: by my calculations your Linguistics bonus should be around +40 by 10th level (10 ranks + 3 class skill + 6 Skill Focus + 5 Intelligence + 6 average inspiration/FCB + 5 custom magic item, 2,500 gp, that grants +5 competence bonus to Linguistics + 5 </span><span class="c8">tears to wine</span><span class="c1">) which should be more than enough for any of your interaction needs.</span></p><p class="c0 c2 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p

Huh? Well, this doctor learned long ago that the easiest way to get all the rewards of an adventuring life with little of the danger was to let others do the hard work. To that end, everything here is based on buffing the team. Let&rsquo;s dive in. The first element I&rsquo;d like to bring your attention to is our aid another capabilities. The Battlefield Disciple trait is a good place to start, as is the Effortless Aid talent and the Got Your Back rogue talent; you&rsquo;ll purchase a </span><span class="c8">benevolent</span><span>&nbsp;rapier, </span><span class="c8">benevolent </span><span>armor, and </span><span class="c8">ring of tactical precision</span><span>&nbsp;as soon as you can to start adding even more bonuses onto your aid another checks. Your basic move in combat will be to flank with an ally, use Got Your Back to consistently pass out </span><span>aid another bonuses</span><span>, and use a combination of Knowledge checks and opportune advice/knowledgeable strike to eviscerate opponents when you need to. If anyone ever attacks you, use mastermind defense and Combat Inspiration to shrug it off. Pretty soon the enemy will focus back on your allies, and that&rsquo;s what you want: remember, let others do the work. Of course, that motto also synergizes nicely with the mastermind and cryptid scholar archetypes: cryptid scholar takes away all of your studied combat and studied strike bonuses, only to give them back to your team, and mastermind lets you use teammates as pawns that benefit from your skill bonuses. We&rsquo;ll pass out buffs liberally through Infusions of </span><span class="c8">alchemical allocation</span><span>, then let others do the heavy lifting. The last piece of the puzzle to fall into place is our non-magical healing abilities, which are in full force by 5th level.

I want to be clear that this build will only marginally resemble the investigator class you&rsquo;ve come to know and love&mdash;there&rsquo;s nothing particularly finessed about it. It&rsquo;s an unholy whirlwind of claws, teeth, and mutagenic death. If we start with combat, well, combat is what this build is meant to do. Dealer&rsquo;s choice about which weapon you&rsquo;ll primarily use&mdash;greatsword, falchion, and greataxe all have their respective advantages and disadvantages, or you could use a longspear if you want the reach and eventual bonuses from your brutality class feature. We&rsquo;ll go with medium or heavy armor to compensate for our generally poor Dexterity score, then smash away with Power Attack and Chaos Reigns; if your GM rules that Chaos Reigns won&rsquo;t work with a two-handed full-attack, just take Improved Initiative earlier. Simple enough. As the build progresses, we&rsquo;ll grab Quick Study and Sickening Offensive for a little single-target debuffing before segueing into Improved Critical, Critical Focus, and Staggering Critical for even more insane damage; because this build isn&rsquo;t particularly reliant on studied combat for its damage, it can crit-fish much more effectively. All our extracts and master chymist abilities will go toward this same goal of growing huge and smashing things, so prioritize things like </span><span class="c8">enlarge person</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c8">long arm</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;that your familiar will use on you.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span>Oh, yeah, that&rsquo;s the other half of this build! Since you&rsquo;re trading away a lot of your skill prowess for fighter and master chymist levels, it makes sense to let a familiar to much of the work for you. Your imp can eventually </span><span class="c8">detect good, detect magic,</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c8">invisibility</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;at will, use all your skill ranks, and use wands of various spells on you. I gave the build Spirit-Ridden to try to work a little versatility in&mdash;your familiar in particular will benefit from that feat.</span></p><p class="c0 c2 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p

It helps that it&rsquo;s extraordinarily powerful, of course! Right off the bat, you get Vital Strike, so at 7th level you should be attacking at your highest BAB for about 8d6+11 damage (average 39 damage; +2 from enhancement bonus, +6 from 1.5x Strength, +1 from studied combat, +2 from Power Attack). You&rsquo;ll still want to full-attack whenever you can to take advantage of your passive damage bonuses, but Vital Strike and Improved Vital Strike are wonderful consolation prizes when you need to do something with your move action. And the later abilities are amazing, too: nosoi plague mask gives you at-will </span><span class="c8">invisibility;</span><span>&nbsp;catrina&rsquo;s calm slaps a </span><span class="c8">calm emotions</span><span>&nbsp;aura on you for dealing with barbarians, bloodragers, and bards; morrigna wrappings grant absurd AC bonuses (not specified as an enhancement bonus, so they stack with your </span><span class="c8">amulet of natural armor!</span><span>) and the benefits of a </span><span class="c8">+5 whip</span><span>&nbsp;that you don&rsquo;t have to use a hand to wield; vanth wings give you a 60-ft. fly speed and surprisingly good cold resistance; and </span><span>yamaraj-feather</span><span>&nbsp;cloak gives you immunity to both death effects and electricity, plus healing if you ever get hit with electricity.

undead minion master with the investigator chassis. How is that possible? It&rsquo;s all thanks to the marvelous gravedigger archetype, without which none of it would work. Let&rsquo;s start with just what the investigator is capable of: you start off with medium armor and scythe proficiency, which opens you up nicely to worship Urgathoa in order to collect on her amazing Divine Fighting Technique. After you upgrade to a </span><span class="c8">keen</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;scythe, you&rsquo;ll have a 10% chance on every hit to get that sweet, sweet x4 crit&mdash;and all the temporary HP that come with Urgathoa&rsquo;s Hunger crits. (Your Wisdom modifier is lowish, so you won&rsquo;t be able to pull this off all that often&mdash;springing for a +2/+2 Wisdom/Intelligence headband isn&rsquo;t the worst idea in the world.) In later levels, I&rsquo;ve tacked on the basics for a demoralize build, with Cornugon Smash and Hurtful complementing Sickening Offensive to give you solid single-target debuffing. If you&rsquo;d rather focus on other priorities, strip out the two feats and your Bruising Intellect trait and replace them with Outflank and Charnel Soldiers.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span>Now the fun part! Your occultist powers. This build&rsquo;s main draw is Necromantic Servant, Soulbound Puppet, and Servitor, all of which let you fill the battlefield with summoned meatshields. I&rsquo;ve made the build as tanky as I reasonably can, but truth be told, your minions should be soaking most of the blows, not you; you&rsquo;ll sic your minions on the boss while you and the team mop up low-CR trash mobs before swooping in for the final kill. Because Necromantic Servant in particular is extraordinarily hard on your inspiration pool, most of your feats after 10th level go toward expanding that pool. If you really want to lean into the caster role and not do much melee combat, ditch Urgathoa&rsquo;s Hunger, Power Attack, Cornugon Smash, and Hurtful, then replace them with three instances of Extra Inspiration and the Extra Investigator Talent (Focus Talent: Psychic Fog) feat. It&rsquo;s a bizarre cleric/psychic/occultist/investigator hybrid that I&rsquo;m in positively in love with!</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c36 c5" id="h.ha5t2tfgge23"><span class="c28">(DEX-R) The Hinterlander</span></h2><p class="c36"><span class="c40">LG Half-Orc Fighter 1 / Cartographer-Natural Philosopher 4 / Hinterlander 5 / Investigator 5</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Strength:</span><span>&nbsp;12 &nbsp;</span><span class="c6">Dexterity:</span><span>&nbsp;15 (+2) &nbsp;</span><span class="c6">Constitution:</span><span>&nbsp;14 &nbsp;</span><span class="c6">Intelligence:</span><span>&nbsp;16 &nbsp;</span><span class="c6">Wisdom:</span><span>&nbsp;10 &nbsp;</span><span class="c6">Charisma:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;7</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Primary Weapon:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Longbow</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Racial Traits:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Shaman&rsquo;s Apprentice, Sacred Tattoo</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Traits:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Fate&rsquo;s Favored (Faith), Magical Knack (Magic)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Favored Class Bonuses:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;HP or Skills, 1-20</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h4 class="c0 c5" id="h.zexgumpy2a2n"><span class="c33">Abilities</span></h4><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c20 c6"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">1:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">2(1):</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Alchemy, natural philosopher&rsquo;s inspiration, track</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">3(2):</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Studied terrain</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">4(3):</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Herbalism, geographic lore</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">5(4):</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Studied combat, studied strike +1d6, swift travels</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">6(1):</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Favored enemy +2</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">7(2):</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Fast movement, favored terrain (hinterland) +2</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">8(3):</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Hinterland stride</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">9(4):</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Chosen kin</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">10(5):</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">11(5):</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">12(6):</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Studied strike +2d6</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">13(7):</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">14(8):</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Studied strike +3d6</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">15(9):</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h4 class="c0 c5" id="h.kmhdtw2a6obq"><span class="c33">Feats and Talents</span></h4><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c20 c6"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">1:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Bonus (Endurance), Point-Blank Shot, Precise Shot</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">2(1):</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">3(2):</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Weapon Focus (Longbow)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">4(3):</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Talent (Infusion;

But fortunately for us, hinterlander exists, and it front-loads its bonus feats in the first five levels. So we&rsquo;re going to take advantage of fighter levels, hinterlander levels, and anything else that we need to get this build off the ground. Thanks to some clever racial trait selection and a fighter dip, even the humble investigator is able to satisfy all the hinterlander prerequisites by 5th level, and by 6th level you have the core elements of a ranged build all in place: PBS, Precise Shot, and Rapid Shot. The 7th-11th level band is a time of enormous growth for this build, with Point-Blank Master, Clustered Shots, Improved Precise Shot, and Hammer the Gap all falling into place quickly. Point-Blank Master and Improved Precise Shot in particular are amazing pulls, as you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to access IPS until quite a bit later in the build without hinterlander levels, and you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to get PBM at all. Throw in Snap Shot and its Improved cousin for good luck, and the build is done.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span>Unfortunately, damn near everything gets sacrificed on the altar of ranged combat: your studied combat and studied strike bonuses lag behind other investigators, you can&rsquo;t pick up any talents until 11th level, and even then you have to prioritize combat taxes like Quick Study and Combat Inspiration, rather than skill buffs. Your extract casting escapes relatively unharmed, thanks to hinterlander&rsquo;s spell progression, which is nice. The combat flow is simple: pop a </span><span class="c8">fly,</span><span>&nbsp;study an enemy as a swift or move action, then loose full-attack after full-attack as soon as you can; if you only have a standard action, Focused Shot will compensate your damage a bit.
