with the Pathfinder RPG. It creates an alternative magic system to use alongside or replace the existing vancian slot and level system, giving at-will abilities and a resource pool for augmenting them, broken down into &lsquo;spheres&rsquo; focused around a variety of themes, each sphere providing basic abilities that are expanded or altered by a talents that go with that sphere. For example, the warp sphere allows a character to teleport a limited distance, while talents that increases the range, allows you to target an enemy, or ignore line of sight for the teleport.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><h1 class="c25" id="h.1fob9te"><span>WHAT IS THE THAUMATURGE?</span></h1><p class="c4"><span class="c6 c8">The thaumaturge is a base class, one of eleven created for the Spheres of Power system, though existing classes are adapted as well. The thaumaturge gains a limited selection of spheres, but can boost their caster level above that of any other class, for a price, not unlike the wilder for those familiar with psionics. This makes them an excellent specialist but a poor generalist.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><h1 class="c25" id="h.3znysh7"><span>GUIDE TO COLOR CODING:</span></h1><p class="c4"><span class="c22 c14">Red </span><span class="c6 c8">options are terrible and should generally be avoided.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c22 c12">Orange </span><span class="c6 c8">options are niche or mediocre and should be avoided outside of particular builds.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c22 c20">Green </span><span class="c6 c8">options are decent but not top priorities.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c19">Blue </span><span class="c6 c8">options are the strongest and/or most versatile and should be prioritized.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><h1 class="c25" id="h.2et92p0"><span>THE BASICS:</span></h1><p class="c4"><span class="c6 c20">D8 hit dice</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;- perfectly standard for a specialist caster type.

Governs your ranged touch attacks (and melee if using weapon finesse), boosts AC (you have light armor), reflex saves, and initiative (if employing battlefield control, going first is vital.

Works with the skilled casting drawback.</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c12">Disguise (Cha)</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&nbsp;&ndash; some campaigns may find good use for it, many others won&rsquo;t. </span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c0">Diplomacy (Cha)</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&nbsp;- My preferred social skill. If Cha-based, you can handle face duties.</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c20">Fly (Dex)</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;- You have the means to get varying degrees of flight and good dex, so tossing a few points in won&rsquo;t hurt anything.</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c20">Intimidate (Cha) </span><span class="c6 c8">- The mean social skill. Great if you work in dazzling display or another means to either spread it over an area or without actions.</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c14">Heal (Wis)</span><span class="c6 c12">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c8">&ndash; Meh. Grab the life sphere if you want to do this.</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c12">Knowledge (All; Int)</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;&ndash; Nice to drop a few ranks for the major monster identifiers (arcana, religion, planes). If Int-based you should grab more and play encyclopedia. </span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c14">Linguistics (Int)</span><span class="c6 c12">&nbsp;</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&ndash; Probably not. Grab a rank if a particular language is needed or it fits your background </span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c14">Perform (Cha)</span><span class="c6 c12">&nbsp;</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&ndash; only use is fluff or for the skilled casting drawback. </span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c14">Profession (Wis)</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;- Fluff skill only. Grab something thematic if using background skills. Works with the skilled casting drawback.</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c20">Sense Motive (Wis) </span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&ndash; Wis-based builds can be good lie detectors. At least one person in the party NEEDS it, backup doesn&rsquo;t hurt. </span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c0">Spellcraft (Int)</span><span class="c6 c20">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c8">&ndash; It&rsquo;s great, especially if crafting. Note that a spellcraft check is, shockingly, required for spellcrafting and magic item crafting as well. Spellcrafting can be all kinds of fun.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4" id="h.4d34og8"><span class="c34 c43 c50">Non-Class Skills</span><span class="c22 c8">&nbsp;(incomplete):</span></p><p class="c4 c33"><span class="c6 c20">Acrobatics (Dex) </span><span class="c6 c8">- nice if you get in a tight spot, but rolling verses CMD gets tricky.</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c20">Bluff (Cha)</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;- a nice social skill, though I prefer diplomacy. Hard to get caught telling the truth. Works for feinting, but feinting is melee-only by default, so unlikely to be worth building around. Melee-based character probably have better things to do with their feats than boost this anyway.</span></p><p class="c4 c33"><span class="c6 c14">Climb (Str)</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;- you are two talents from flight, so not really a priority. </span></p><p class="c4 c33"><span class="c6 c8">Easy to get in class with a trait.</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c12">Escape Artist (Dex) </span><span class="c6 c8">- Great to have when you need it, but you should be avoiding those situations. I like the warp sphere for that reason.</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c0">Perception (Wis)</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;- Most rolled skill in the game. Max it if possible.</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c20">Stealth (Dex) </span><span class="c6 c8">- You should have decent dex and light armor, so this isn&rsquo;t a bad investment. Depending on your focus, you could become an excellent scout. If you want it, grab a trait to get it in class.</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c14">Survival (Wis) </span><span class="c6 c8">- Not your job. Wis-based can cover this by taking 10 anyway.</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c14">Swim (Str) </span><span class="c6 c8">- Not more than a point here unless in an aquatic campaign. If in an aquatic campaign, get a swim speed from somewhere (alteration sphere, for example).</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c0">UMD (Cha)</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;- Handy for filling in all kinds of affects you can&rsquo;t get natively or don&rsquo;t have room for. Remember the pragmatic activator trait if going for an Int-based build.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c24 c10"><span class="c21"></span></p><h1 class="c25" id="h.2s8eyo1"><span>PARTY ROLES:</span></h1><p class="c4"><span class="c13 c8">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c38">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c8">Party roles are tricky to rate for this class, since you can build for almost anything. Instead, I will provide concepts for how you go about building for that role.</span><span class="c13 c8">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4 c7 c10"><span class="c11 c6 c14"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6">Melee Striker &ndash; Two levels of magus, then take the devourer archetype. You should crit frequently, allowing you to use forbidden lore without risk frequently in combat. You could also go for natural attacks, picking them up from race and the alteration sphere. You can also cover this with summons.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6">Tank &ndash; You don&rsquo;t have anything natively here, but the protection sphere combined with other abilities can make this work, boosting AC and reducing incoming damage. Think more about mitigating damage to allies than standing up front and drawing attention. Alteration is a good source of natural armor. War can help with tanking too. A horde of zombies (death), animated objects (enhancement), or an outsider meatshield (conjuration) work too.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6">Ranged Striker &ndash; Destruction is the go-to here, though telekinesis, weather, and other spheres present options as well. </span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6">Debuffer &ndash; Death carries a good number of debuffs, as does destruction with rider effects on destructive blast. Light, dark, time, many spheres have debuffs of varying potency. You can&rsquo;t take all or even most of them though, so if this is your goal, pick a sphere heavy in it.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6">Buffer &ndash; alteration, enhancement, and time are golden here.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6">Utility &ndash; Again, scattered throughout the spheres. Hard for you to have the breadth to cover the wide variety of niche situations you rely on a utility caster for. This is an incanter&rsquo;s job, but you can build for maximizing your utility or get real creative with the most versatile spheres.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6">Battlefield Control &ndash; (BFC) Creation, destruction, nature, telekinesis, warp, weather. A vital role for the party to have and you can do it well. </span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><h1 class="c25 c41"><span class="c21"></span></h1><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c24 c10"><span class="c52 c22 c8 c59"></span></p><h1 class="c25" id="h.17dp8vu"><span>CLASS ABILITIES:</span></h1><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c22 c20">Forbidden Lore</span><span class="c22 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c8">&ndash; starts off at +2 cl with a 15% chance of backlash. Backlash is nasty. Note that you can&rsquo;t go below an effective CL of 1, handy at low levels. The loss of action is painful as well. This is really the backbone of the class, but using it is risky, especially prior to level 7, where you can pass off the effects with an incantation. Devourers don&rsquo;t mind as long as they are getting crits. </span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c22 c20">Invocations </span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&ndash; Limited uses per day with a variety of effects as you level. </span></p><p class="c4 c26"><span class="c22 c12">Meditation </span><span class="c23 c6 c8">&ndash; retry a knowledge check. Great if you are the party encyclopedia, not so much otherwise.</span></p><p class="c4 c26"><span class="c22 c20">Lingering Pain </span><span class="c23 c6 c8">&ndash; fort save or sickened as a rider to another effect. Sickened softens up their saves, but fort saves tend to be high in the bestiary.</span></p><p class="c4 c26"><span class="c22 c20">Lingering Blessing </span><span class="c6 c49">&ndash; can&rsquo;t complain about temporary hit points (</span><span class="c6 c49">THP</span><span class="c23 c6 c8">), even in modest quantities. Mostly useful if you are buffing/healing in combat a lot.</span></p><p class="c4 c26"><span class="c22 c20">Empowered Defense </span><span class="c23 c6 c8">&ndash; a nice dodge bonus for yourself, great for the martially inclined, but be aware that it won&rsquo;t stack with other deflection bonuses.</span></p><p class="c4 c26"><span class="c19">Empowered Attack</span><span class="c22 c20">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c49">&ndash; excellent for those reliant on attack rol</span><span class="c6 c49">l</span><span class="c23 c6 c8">s, useless if not. Untyped, so should always stack.</span></p><p class="c4 c26"><span class="c36 c22">*Channel Punishment*</span><span class="c22 c20">&nbsp;</span><span class="c23 c6 c8">&ndash; the reason to consider taking the extra invocations feat. Pass off your backlash to another creature. Unwilling targets get a save, so if you don&rsquo;t feel lucky find a way to get a familiar, psicrystal, animal companion, hireling, etc to take the pain for you.</span></p><p class="c4 c26"><span class="c19">Defensive Invocation</span><span class="c22 c20">&nbsp;</span><span class="c23 c6 c8">&ndash; save bonus, untyped. Helps with your weak saves, could be a life saver.</span></p><p class="c4 c26"><span class="c22 c20">Soulfire</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c23 c6 c8">&ndash; boost everything if you take backlash. It&rsquo;s a solid bonus, but unless you know you are in the final battle of the day it&rsquo;s risky. Usually you will prefer channel punishment over this.</span></p><p class="c4 c26"><span class="c19">Item Lore</span><span class="c22 c20">&nbsp;</span><span class="c23 c6 c8">&ndash; add forbidden lore bonus to item CL. This is really excellent since with your limited talents you will be very invested in expanding your abilities with items. Combine with the wand wielder feat for maximum effect. Note that it does not say you use forbidden lore, just that you add the bonus, so no backlash!</span></p><p class="c4 c26"><span class="c22 c20">Empowered Resistance</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c23 c6 c8">&ndash; evasion and stalwart rolled into one, but only for one roll. Great if you know what you are getting hit with.</span></p><p class="c4 c26"><span class="c22 c12">Rebuke Death</span><span class="c22 c20">&nbsp;</span><span class="c23 c6 c8">&ndash; best not to need it, but handy if you do. Doesn&rsquo;t help with death effects, but by 19 you should have those covered anyway.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c23 c6 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c22 c20">Occult Knowledge </span><span class="c6 c8">&ndash; Scaling bonus to good skills. It&rsquo;s nice, but don&rsquo;t be afraid to trade it out. If you rely on forcing saves, ditch it to take unspeakable pact.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c19">Bonus Feats</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;&ndash; anything that requires casting. Mostly going to be extra talent, though there are some fun other feats if you can spare the room. </span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c22 c20">Master Invoker</span><span class="c6 c20">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c8">&ndash; unlimited use of two invocations? Sweet. Too bad it&rsquo;s so late you won&rsquo;t get to use it. Channel punishment is a top pick, defensive invocation or item lore next, depending on your build and magic item availability.</span></p><p class="c57 c7 c10"><span class="c47 c22 c8"></span></p><h1 class="c25" id="h.3rdcrjn"><span>WHY PLAY A THAUMATURGE?</span></h1><p class="c24"><span class="c11 c6 c8">The first question in choosing a Spheres of Power class is &lsquo;Why not play an incanter instead?&rsquo; This is a good question. The thaumaturge is capable of being a powerful caster in any sphere, but the selection of talents is so limited that you have to consider carefully what is required for your concept and if the class can deliver.</span></p><h2 class="c17" id="h.26in1rg"><span class="c6">Vs Incanter</span></h2><p class="c24"><span class="c11 c6 c8">The thaumaturge has a stronger chassis, with better HD, skills, and armor proficiency, for what it&rsquo;s worth. Aside from that, the comparison becomes difficult. The thaumaturge always has the highest potential caster level, and thus raw power, but you cannot count on this power at all times and the loss in sheer number of talents is staggering, allowing the incanter to go deeper into a given sphere faster than an equal level thaumaturge, which in some cases will, at least for a time, compensate or even surpass the difference in CL. Many spheres have talents that increase the maximum size or range of the effects available, essentially treating the caster as if they had a significantly higher CL for that purpose. These are also available to the thaumaturge, of course, but the opportunity cost is higher.</span></p><p class="c24"><span class="c6">There are two areas that the thaumaturge is unsurpassed in, however. </span><span class="c6 c44">With the master of cosmos feat, the thaumaturge will have the most powerful conjuration companions in the game, though other classes will be able to have a greater number of companions. Flooding the field with a huge number of summons is bad form at most tables, so I don&rsquo;t recommend building an incanter with every talent spent on extra companion.</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c61 c8 c54 c40">Recent errata has changed the master of cosmos feat from adding your forbidden lore bonus to CL for determining your companion&rsquo;s strength to being a flat bonus to attack rolls and skill checks. Still nice, not nearly what it was. </span></p><p class="c24"><span class="c11 c6 c8">With the master of Death feat, the thaumaturge will be able to animate more and more powerful undead as well, making it the choice class for minion-mancy. Since these feats don&rsquo;t actually require using forbidden lore, they just add your forbidden lore bonus to your CL for the given purposes, you don&rsquo;t risk backlash in their use either.</span></p><p class="c24"><span class="c11 c6 c8">Ultimately, the thaumaturge is best played when you want to specialize, especially in spheres lacking specialist classes already, and don&rsquo;t mind a bit of risk on your path to ultimate (narrow) power. Note that some spheres scale more heavily on number of talents rather than CL, such as the life sphere. These aren&rsquo;t good for you.</span></p><p class="c24 c10"><span class="c11 c6 c8"></span></p><h2 class="c17" id="h.lnxbz9"><span class="c6">Vs Elementalist</span></h2><p class="c24"><span class="c6">For a specialist in the destruction sphere, a comparison to the elementalist is in order as the blasting potential of the thaumaturge will seem obvious to many. The elementalist has two more good saves, evasion, dodge bonus, free movement modes, and resistances. The thaumaturge get full CL for all spheres, but gets less talents overall and requires special considerations in character design to mitigate the drawbacks of its feature ability, forbidden lore. Over the levels, the thaumaturge will be able to attain a caster level between 2 and 6 (8 if using the human favored class bonus) levels higher than the elementalist, which is between 1d6 and 3d6 damage on your basic blast or 2d6 &ndash; 6d6 if spending a spell point. This results in 3.5 to 10.5 extra damage base, 7 to 21 damage augmented. By the time the thaumaturge is getting +6 level from forbidden lore (17</span><span class="c6 c42">th</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;level), the elementalist is getting 1.5*level damage on their 1</span><span class="c6 c42">st</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&nbsp;favored element, so +25 at level 17 and +30 damage at level 20, with +17 on their second favored element, and +8 on their third. </span></p><p class="c24"><span class="c11 c6 c8">So the elementalist can do more pure damage, but only with one blast type. However, the thaumaturge risks backlash every time it boosts it&rsquo;s CL. You lose the action even when using channel punishment, which is painful in combat, and incantations are limited. The dearth of talents granted the thaumaturge means that feats are tight, so the elementalist actually has more room to diversify both within destruction and into other spheres, especially since the combat feats you need can often be covered by your bonus feats. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c24"><span class="c6 c8 c11">The damage comparison gets shifted a bit if you dip sorcerer, boosting damage by +1/CL, but the risk of using forbidden lore frequently remains.</span></p><p class="c24"><span class="c11 c6 c8">For a specialist in the Nature Sphere, the geomancer archetype elementalist gets a constant+6/+4/+2 CL over the levels to three of the four geomancing packages, making it appealing for a specialist. The thaumaturge can boost all of the packages, but loses out in other areas. Both choices are legitimate, though don&rsquo;t forget that obtaining all four geomancing packages will eat into your talents.</span></p><h2 class="c17" id="h.35nkun2"><span class="c6">Vs Other Specialists</span></h2><p class="c24"><span class="c11 c6 c8">You cannot match the versatility of the fey adept with create reality and illusions require a fair number of talents to really get going. Create reality is so good that I can&rsquo;t recommend playing an illusion specialist without going fey adept. The eliciter gets significant bonuses to mind sphere DCs, making the forbidden lore bonuses less appealing for enchantment specialists. Thaumaturges have a fair argument against symbiats (telekinetic warrior) in the telekinesis field, given the advantages of high CL in lifting objects and weapons, though a dip in symbiat can be beneficial for such a build. Hedge witch (triple goddess archetype) will be better with the life and fate spheres due to having more talents, though not able to match the HD of undead controlled from the death sphere.</span></p><h1 class="c25" id="h.1ksv4uv"><span class="c6">RACES</span></h1><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c23 c6 c8"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c6 c8">First, a few notes about priorities here that will guide race choice regardless of sources available. Bonuses to dex and your casting stat are great, bonuses to con are good, and penalties to str if you aren&rsquo;t str-based melee or cha if you don&rsquo;t use it to cast are acceptable. Small size is a boon for casting-focused builds, since generally speaking combat maneuvers aren&rsquo;t your thing and the bonus to AC and attack rolls is lovely. Small creatures also have an easier time bringing mounts inside without spending a feat on undersized mount. The stealth bonus is nice for some builds too. By the same token, large races are generally going to be bad unless looking for melee reach. Darkvision is a nice bonus, as are movement modes, though you get flight in-class at a reasonable level so climb speeds aren&rsquo;t terribly important. Natural attack builds of course want free natural attacks. Magus dippers will appreciate the prehensile tail races for ease of juggling wands, rods, and staves, though they are handy for anyone once having a variety of items in combat becomes important.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c11 c6 c8"></span></p><h2 class="c17" id="h.44sinio"><span class="c6">Core Races</span></h2><p class="c4"><span class="c19">Dwarf</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;&ndash; </span><span class="c0">great choice</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;for Wisdom-based builds, </span><span class="c6 c20">okay</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;for Intelligence-based builds, </span><span class="c6 c14">terrible </span><span class="c11 c6 c8">for Charisma-based builds. Grab the steel soul feat and glory of old trait to shore up your saves. Darkvision is nice to have and the skill bonus could work out for you if you are using the skilled casting drawback.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c19">Elf </span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&ndash; solid choice for Int-builds, though Con loss is never pleasant. Weapon proficiencies are decent if going single-class melee, and a bonus to beating spell resistance is nice. You can get darkvision with alternate racials.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c22 c20">Gnome</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&nbsp;&ndash; small size and great stat boosts for Cha-builds. Skill bonus can work for the skilled drawback. Fire talents could get a bonus from the pyromaniac alternate racial, ask your DM.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c19">Halfling</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">: - perfect stat spread for Cha-casters, small size. Grab the alternate racial to boost your speed up to 30&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c22 c12">Half-Elf</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&nbsp;&ndash; choice of stat boosts is nice and some options are decent, but not a standout race.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c22 c20">Half-Orc</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&nbsp;&ndash; choice of stats and ferocity are good, as is getting darkvision. Can get a bite attack with alternate racials. Free proficiency with the falchion is excellent for devourers that don&rsquo;t dip magus.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c19">Human</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&nbsp;&ndash; free feat, extra skills, good at anything. What did you expect?</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c11 c22 c8"></span></p><h2 class="c17" id="h.2jxsxqh"><span>Other Notable Races</span></h2><p class="c4"><span class="c19">Aasimar</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&nbsp;&ndash; they come in a variety of stats boosts and the sidebar even allows small size, with resistances to boot! Good for anything.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c19">Goblin</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&nbsp;&ndash; Paizo&rsquo;s favorite miniature psychopaths, the big dex boost is great, just don&rsquo;t do Cha-based.

Given the stat spread the strongtail option will likely be unwelcome in most campaigns.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c19">Tiefling</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;&ndash; like aasimar, but with a -2 to a stat. Plenty of options. The tail is nice for juggling staves, rods, and wands, which should be a concern once you have some money, so is </span><span class="c19">highly recommended </span><span class="c6">(fiendish sorcery wasn&rsquo;t likely to help you anyhow). </span><span class="c11 c6 c8">You can also get natural attacks if going that route.

Don&rsquo;t forget the sidebar allowing you to grab small size!</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c19">Skinwalker</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;&ndash; another race with a variety of alternate options to suite your stat needs.

Casting mod duration should already get you through a combat, so not great.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c22 c14">Elf</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&ndash; boost occult knowledge slightly. Not great and you may be swapping it out with an archetype anyhow. +3 over 20 levels does not impress.. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c19">Gnome</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&nbsp;&ndash; reduce backlash chance. It is a small amount, but worthwhile.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c19">Half-Elf</span><span class="c6 c14">&nbsp;</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&ndash; 3 talents over the levels is solid.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c22 c12">Half-Orc</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&nbsp;&ndash; duration boost for empowered offense. Since melee types won&rsquo;t have as high a casting mod, this helps a bit, but won&rsquo;t really be worthwhile at higher levels once you have boosted your stats.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c22 c20">Halfling</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">: Extra uses of invocations are helpful, worth taking.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c19">Human</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&nbsp;&ndash; the interesting option. Boosts your forbidden lore bonus, but also backlash. Since it doesn&rsquo;t kick in until you already have channel punishment, I think it&rsquo;s worthwhile, doubly so for devourers. Note that half-elves and half-orcs can take this as well.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c11 c22 c8"></span></p><h2 class="c17" id="h.1y810tw"><span>Other Notable Races</span></h2><p class="c4"><span class="c22 c12">Aasimar</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&ndash; extra THP from lingering blessing. Again, it&rsquo;s okay for buffers, but requires using forbidden knowledge and an invocation.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c19">Goblin</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&nbsp;&ndash; extra spell points are excellent.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c19">Merfolk</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&nbsp;&ndash; Boost invocation DCs, great for channel punishment used in a hostile manner.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c19">Orc</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;&ndash; increase damage from any sphere?

The downside is that your base backlash percentage is 20% instead of 15%. Awesome for melee builds that can grab a keen weapon with high crit range.

This one starts useful and scales nicely, making this the strongest pact for most of the game.</span></p><p class="c24 c26"><span class="c6 c20">Gift of Knowledge</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;&ndash; makes meditation much better. Great for the party encyclopedia, </span><span class="c6 c14">not very helpful </span><span class="c11 c6 c8">if you don&rsquo;t take ranks in knowledge skills.</span></p><p class="c24 c26"><span class="c6 c14">Lingering Madness</span><span class="c6 c20">&nbsp;</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&ndash; add a wisdom damage rider, will negates.

There is some real utility here, but the thaumaturge will feel the loss of the feats given their tiny talent pool. The more focused you are on a limited set of abilities, the more you can afford it, but it is going to be a tough call for the limited capabilities of the unseen horror at the levels you can start stacking on multiple. A grappling hook or the ability to slip through cracks are cool and flavorful, but you could have grabbed warp and unseeing teleport instead.</span></p><h1 class="c25" id="h.3whwml4"><span>SPHERES</span></h1><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6 c8">Every sphere has its uses and as a full caster you can use them to their fullest extent. The best spheres for a thaumaturge to focus on are ones that depend heavily on scaling CL effects and saves, since you have the means to push yours higher than anyone else..</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c11 c6 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c0">Alteration</span><span class="c6 c20">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c8">- grabbing this and the right talents can get you movement modes early, enhanced senses, size alteration, etc. Versatility that you can use. For melee types, this is even more key, since you can pick up natural attacks this way and you will want as many as possible, plus you can get pounce to boot. Strength melee loves the size boosts, but everyone can enjoy fly speeds and natural armor.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c11 c6 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c0">Conjuration</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;- a very strong school and even dipping your toes in can yield significant benefits, granting an ally not dissimilar to an eidolon. </span><span class="c44 c6 c8">You are one feat away from the strongest companions possible, having yours meet or exceed your HD</span><span class="c44 c6">.</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">The feat is nice, but no longer lets you boosts companion HD. You still get an extra body, which is nice.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c11 c6 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c20">Creation </span><span class="c11 c6 c8">- Creation is limited by only your imagination and your spell points. Forbidden lore will get you bigger creations earlier, so that&rsquo;s a plus. The sooner you can drop a wall around an enemy caster to break line of sight the better. The greatest drawback is that the at-will is weak, so anything interesting requires spell points.</span></p><p class="c4 c7 c10"><span class="c11 c6 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c12">Dark</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&nbsp;&ndash; Gives some fair debuffing and battlefield control which could be combined well with the right race (fetchlings for example can get see in darkness from feats).</span></p><p class="c4 c7 c10"><span class="c11 c6 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c0">Death</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&nbsp;&ndash; Ghost strike gives some powerful debuffs and you will have the save DCs to make them stick, especially with the unspeakable pact. You also can create the biggest, most powerful undead of any class, so this is a great choice. Ghost strike also works well with magus-dippers.</span></p><p class="c4 c7 c10"><span class="c11 c6 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c12">Destruction</span><span class="c6 c20">&nbsp;</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&ndash; You can make far use of this, especially on a melee build, but if you really want to specialize here, why not play an elementalist?</span></p><p class="c4 c7 c10"><span class="c11 c6 c12"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c12">Divination</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&nbsp;&ndash; probably necessary if you are playing the role of primary arcanist. There are some good talents to boost sense, though nothing in the sphere really plays to your strengths. Necessary if you need to read magic writing for rituals and such. Basic divinations take way too long without spell points, but there are some good sense options. Better for an incanter than you, given that it expands its usefulness primarily based on how many talents you have to be able to detect and see through different things.</span></p><p class="c4 c7 c10"><span class="c11 c6 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c0">Enhancement</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;&ndash; way too many enhancement bonuses here for my preference, since they won&rsquo;t stack with common items. That said, cripple and steal senses are fun debuffs and with your CL boosts you can have GREAT fun with animated objects. Want a squadron of flying </span><span class="c6">cannon</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">s? Animate object, bestow intelligence, and mass enhancement. You can easily animate an entire ship by level 10! Combine with conjuration and the mounted caster feat for another way to have fun, buffing your mount into a combat beast. A solid choice for building around.</span></p><p class="c4 c7 c10"><span class="c11 c6 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c20">Fate</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&nbsp;&ndash; All-purpose buffs, protection from alignment, and rerolls. The best uses are going to burn through spell points, but clever players can have fun with judgement. A useful sphere for playing support.</span></p><p class="c4 c7 c10"><span class="c11 c6 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c20">Illusion</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&nbsp;&ndash; another sphere limited only by your creativity. Worth picking up even if you just do it to get invisibility for shoring up your defenses. If you do, use the vanisher drawback so it only takes one talent. Not a prime choice for heavy focus, if you want to do that, play a fey adept.</span></p><p class="c4 c7 c10"><span class="c11 c6 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c12">Life</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&nbsp;&ndash; the problem with life is that you tend to get greater benefit from putting more talents into it than from higher CL. Grab it to be able to cover the role and use healing wands and such if your party needs you to, but don&rsquo;t go deep.</span></p><p class="c4 c7 c10"><span class="c11 c6 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c20">Light</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&nbsp;&ndash; the base ability isn&rsquo;t much to write home about, but a few of the talents are worth considering, especially repelling light to keep enemy melee off you and revealing light for dealing with invisibility. Bound light is a must have as well and makes for an excellent spellcraft combo with blinding light to completely hose a target (provided your party has ranged attacks so as not to blind themselves when taking advantage of the situation. Encompassing light is a great melee buff you both you and your companion as well. Remember that you can only have one source of actual size increase and one of virtual size increase at one time. This provides the virtual increase, alteration the actual, allowing you to act VERY large. No good direct damage here, but surprisingly strong otherwise.</span></p><p class="c4 c7 c10"><span class="c11 c6 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c20">Mind</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;&ndash; will save or lose: the sphere. You have the oomph to make these stick, but so does the eliciter, who doesn&rsquo;t risk tanking his abilities to do so. Grab a couple, charm and dominate are nice, but you shouldn&rsquo;t make this the heart of your abilities. If you grab any, grab the expanded charm talent to make sure it</span><span class="c6">&#39;</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">s useable unless you are in a campaign that guarantees you don&rsquo;t need it.</span></p><p class="c4 c7 c10"><span class="c11 c6 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c20">Nature</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&nbsp;&ndash; there are some gems here, though you&rsquo;ll have to ask if you are better off playing a geomancer instead. If only taking one package, earth offers the excellent forge earth talent for minimal investment.</span></p><p class="c4 c7 c10"><span class="c11 c6 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c20">Protection</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&nbsp;&ndash; another good support sphere, allowing you to apply long-term buffs out of combat and soften enemy attacks during combat. Hr/level duration on aegis effects make them perfect bases for spellcrafting, if that isn&rsquo;t too cheesy for you table (anchor haste on your AC buff, etc.).</span></p><p class="c4 c7 c10"><span class="c11 c6 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c20">Telekinesis</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;&ndash; the art of lifting things with your mind and smacking them against other things. You can get better use out of hostile lift than anyone, which can shut-down an enemy without ranged abilities, and can get more items in the air faster as well. Note that Adam Meyers has said that dancing reach weapons should still threaten larger areas, so you can manage some impressive threatened area with combat reflexes. Powerful telekinesis is a must ASAP. If telekinetic maneuvers didn&rsquo;t eat so many penalties I would recommend them as well, but that -5 really hurts. Still, forbidden lore makes you better at it then anyone else. I wouldn&rsquo;t specialize in bu</span><span class="c6">l</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">lrushes though, an air warrior elementalist does that better. Tripping may be a good idea, since tripping feats also help you make use of a field of dancing weapons, though if you are tripping with dancing weapons anyway you are better of using them rather than giving them a will save AND having to beat CMD. Don&rsquo;t forget quick draw to bring them out fast enough!</span></p><p class="c4 c7 c10"><span class="c11 c6 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c0">Time</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;&ndash; Teammates and conjured companions will love an </span><span class="c6">extra attack from level 1</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&nbsp;(works best with the easy focus boon) and you have some very solid save-based abilities such as aging, slow, and steal time (which is just wonderful, daze enemy plus extra action, yes please!). This one loves good teamwork, so can be very powerful in the right group. If you have no martial characters to buff, you lose a bit, but there&rsquo;s still something to be had here.</span></p><p class="c4 c7 c10"><span class="c11 c6 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c20">War</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">&ndash; the mass buff/debuff sphere. Going to be more campaign dependent than most, since the buffs are relatively small to balance the fact that they can cover huge areas, making them amazing for games with large, martial heavy parties or when employing large forces (mass combat rules perhaps?). The rally talents are useful as well, being immediate actions that can, for example, grant a re-rolled save. You may want to look at them for supporting your party, taking the drawback to remove the ability to use totems and thus saving you the action of placing a totem to have ready for rallying. If you keep your totems, look at combining some using spellcrafting for vastly more efficient buffing.</span></p><p class="c4 c7 c10"><span class="c11 c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c20">Warp </span><span class="c6">&ndash; tactical teleportation is awesome. So is having a panic button to get away. Offensive uses are limited though, </span><span class="c6">keeping this from a higher rating</span><span class="c6">. There aren&rsquo;t that many saves or powerfully scaling abilities to warrant focusing a thaumaturge on, but even the basic ability is nice to have just in general. Teleportation beacon can save the party as well, so consider getting it via item if you can fit it in.</span></p><h1 class="c25" id="h.2bn6wsx"><span>FEATS</span></h1><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c8">A note on Metamagic: most metamagic feats work with the spheres system, increasing casting time and costing spell points equal to their level adjustment. This gets expensive quickly, but metamagic is powerful. I recommend metamagic rods given the limited spell points you will have, but grabbing still spell or silent spell could save your bacon if you took certain drawbacks, neatly getting you out of the occasional situation the drawback hurts you in.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><h2 class="c17" id="h.qsh70q"><span>Spheres Feats:</span></h2><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c8">Advanced Magical Training - a multiclassing feat, letting you get &frac12; CL for non-casting class levels.

The more levels you spend elsewhere, the more you need it.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c14">Arcane Empowerment</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;- this is for traditional casters dipping their toes in spheres, not for you.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c8 c13"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c14">Artificery </span><span class="c6 c8">- it&rsquo;s the master craftsman feat plus. You aren&rsquo;t limited to what crafting feats you can apply it to and you get +2 to the skill. Not really for you, though needed as a prerequisite for dedicated crafters.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c12">Artificery, Improved</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;- you no longer need the base sphere to craft an item. Useful for a dedicated crafter. Probably want to be intelligence based to boost spellcraft, though if you choose a profession skill for artificery then wisdom based builds work just as well. Crafting is going to be group, DM, and campaign dependent, so take it if it works.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c14">Basic Magic Training </span><span class="c6 c8">- you don&rsquo;t qualify.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c20">Cantrips </span><span class="c6 c8">- you get an array of minor magical abilities that mimic traditional cantrips.

Not that great in combat, but powerful for long duration out of combat spells. It would be blue, but it depends on other people&#39;s builds unless you can get leadership or another source of minions. Even then, it requires CL 10, so it isn&rsquo;t happening early.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c0">Contingency </span><span class="c11 c6 c8">- combine with the right sphere and this is a life saver in a very literal way. Check out teleportation beacon, for example.</span></p><p class="c4 c7 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c20">Counterspell </span><span class="c6 c8">- you can spend a spell point to dispel an ongoing effect or as a readied action to counterspell. Dispel is a thing casters are expected to have, so this feat is good if no one else in your group can cover it.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c20">Counterspell, Improved</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;- spend more spell points to hit more effects or an area. If you have counterspell, you probably want this too.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c12">Counterspell, Greater </span><span class="c6 c8">- you can hit artifacts now and dispel in a 40&rsquo; radius. Less necessary than its antecedents. </span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c20">Counterspell Mastery </span><span class="c6 c8">- counterspell as an immediate action. Shutting down an enemy caster&rsquo;s big moment can make a tough encounter a cake-walk. If you are in the counterspelling field, get it.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c8">Craft Rituals - rituals are a way to get traditional magic effects that are absent from the spheres system.</span><span class="c6 c20">&nbsp;Useful if traditional magic is absent from your campaign,</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c14">not worth it otherwise.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c12">Create Spell Book </span><span class="c6 c8">- if you use the spell crafting system heavily, this will be nice to have, but given the more focused nature of your specialization, you can probably cover what you need to without it.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c12">Delay Magic</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&nbsp;- could be useful in the right situation, but requires planning and foresight.</span></p><p class="c4 c7 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c20">Extra Invocations </span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&ndash; good if you find yourself running out, since you really don&rsquo;t get that many.</span></p><p class="c4 c7 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c20">Extra Magic Talent </span><span class="c6 c8">- The feat you take whenever you don&rsquo;t have something you really need. Every feat should be weighed against this one, since you can never have too many talents.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c20">Extra Spell Pool</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;- 2 more spell points each time.

A swift action for double your casting mod on your attacks is fun. Doesn&rsquo;t help your AOEs, but makes your other attacks more potent.

This will save you from having to reduce your CL to get your next spell off, which may save your hide. Of course, you could just use a reduced CL teleport from the warp sphere to get away, so it isn&rsquo;t required.

Nice for having a place to dump your backlash penalties with channel punishment. Ask your DM if this qualifies you for improved familiar. If so, there are some good choices and you don&rsquo;t have any bonuses to lose by taking it. Gets the full benefits if you take improved familiar bond or get a level in a familiar-granting class (like taking arcane bloodline on an incanter dip). A familiar for two feats, just like eldritch heritage, but you don&rsquo;t need 13 CHA and the first feat is slightly better, but you don&rsquo;t get the familiar bonuses.</span></p><p class="c39 c7"><span class="c6 c20">Improved Familiar</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&ndash; plenty of interesting options here, like the faerie dragon that has its own casting, which is useful for having it use wands and such. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c39 c7"><span class="c6 c20">Improved Familiar Bond</span><span class="c6 c12">&nbsp;</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&ndash; you get all the abilities for your familiar.

Trying to match a particular character from fiction or the standard magic system? Looking for limitations on your arcane power? Drawbacks are the answer! You may, with DM approval, take a number of drawbacks. These can be general drawbacks, taken at creation, which can either be traded in for boons or to increase the rate you accumulate spell points as you level (1/level maximum with five drawbacks), or sphere-specific drawbacks, taken when first gaining a given sphere, which grant a bonus talent in that sphere. Sphere specific drawbacks can also be removed by &lsquo;paying&rsquo; for the bonus talent later on, making them a good option early on for expanding your breadth of abilities.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><h2 class="c17" id="h.147n2zr"><span>General Drawbacks</span></h2><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c14">Addictive Casting</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;- make a fort save every time you use a spell point, with an increasing DC or gain an addiction. This one counts as two drawbacks, but it is really nasty. Could be workable if you have lots of downtime and few encounters per day, but I count it mostly as NPC or word-building material. </span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6">Draining Casting </span><span class="c6 c8">- Take unhealable non-lethal damage every time to use a sphere ability. It works as the basis for a blood-mage type character combined with the Fortified Casting boon. </span><span class="c0">Great</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;if all you do is summon conjuration companions or raise a few undead each morning, but anyone that needs to cast almost every round (blasters, debuffers, magus-dippers) will </span><span class="c6 c14">hate it.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c14">Extended Casting </span><span class="c6 c8">- All your sphere abilities take longer to use, increasing times by one step. </span><span class="c0">Excellent</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;for dedicated minion masters or builds that do all their casting out of combat. Taking a full round for anything in-combat hurts and it&rsquo;s even worse if you already are lengthening casting times with spellcrafting. </span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c20">Focus Casting </span><span class="c6 c8">- Casting requires a focus object, with penalties similar to the wizard&rsquo;s arcane bond. Depends on your DM. If disarms and prisons feature heavily in your campaigns, avoid it. Note that you can make the DC for your casting lower by voluntarily reducing the CL of the ability you are using, which can help ensure you get the ability off in a pinch (best if the ability isn&rsquo;t save-dependent). Grab the warp sphere and teleportation beacon to make sure you can call it back to you </span><span class="c6">if</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;lost.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c0">Magical Signs</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;- some tell-tale lets everyone in 30&rsquo; knows you are casting and what the nature of the spell is. Avoid it if you are trying to be stealthy, but most of the time the ball of death you are hurling will give you away anyhow.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c12">Material Casting</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;- every ability costs money based on CL. The exact nature of the material spent is dependent on your DM. Another one that is </span><span class="c6 c20">fine</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;for builds that use a few long-lasting abilities.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c12">Painful Magic</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;- fort save or be sickened every time you cast, escalating to nauseated if already sickened. Duration is short. Almost a freebie if doing the blood-mage combo (draining casting + fortified casting) since you will have such high CON you won&rsquo;t miss the save often. For everyone else, you can pull it off if you optimize your Fort save, but you risk bad rolls stealing actions at key times. As is often the case, it doesn&rsquo;t hurt out of combat casting at all.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c20">Prepared Caster </span><span class="c6 c8">- You have to assign spell points to spheres at the beginning of each day. Since you will likely focus heavily on only a few spheres, this can be a decent option. For example, set aside just enough SP to keep your conjuration companion going all day, then dump the rest in your other main sphere. More diversified builds should be cautious though.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c20">Skilled Casting</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;- you have to make a perform, craft, or profession skill check or suffer reduced caster level. This meshes well with many concepts and characters from fiction. It might be tough early on, but skill checks can be optimized, especially after you have a few levels under your belt. An interesting option. Note that humans and half-elves can get skill focus at level 1 and other races offer various skill boosting options. Also note that the chosen skill might carry drawbacks, like perform (sing) doesn&rsquo;t work in a silence effect or (dance) if you are immobilized. One rank, 18 in the stat, favored class bonus, a trait, and skill focus get you to 12 at level 1, so a racial bonus or another skill feat pretty well gets you there.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c0">Somatic </span><span class="c6 c20">Casting </span><span class="c6 c8">- you require a free hand to cast and now have to pay attention to arcane spell failure chances. Taken once allow light armor, twice allows no armor. Avoid it if your DM likes grappling enemies, but otherwise it is a strong option for taking once, provided you aren&rsquo;t dipping cleric or another class and getting better armor. Note that only armor is mentioned, so bucklers are fine. If your DM decides otherwise, mithral bucklers have 0% ASF and are reasonably priced. Grab still spell sometime, just in case.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c0">Verbal Casting </span><span class="c6 c8">- you now have verbal components. If you have skilled casting in a skill that requires vocalization, this is a freebie. Not so good for sneaks, good for others. Grab silent spell for emergencies.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c22 c8">Wild Magic </span><span class="c6 c8">- 10% chance to add a rod of wonder effect to your casting. Hilarious, but your party may hate you. If your DM uses the </span><span class="c35 c6"><a class="c5" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/rods/rod-of-wonder&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117718424000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3UOCQxQ_U5joiesHWnrIpS">rod of wonder</a></span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;table as suggested, this is actually quite good so long as you make sure your effects happen AT enemies, since most of the options on the table impact the target. Not recommended if you do healing and buffing. If your DM uses a different table your mileage may vary. Unrated since it is so concept and DM dependent.</span></p><p class="c4 c7 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><h2 class="c17" id="h.3o7alnk"><span>Sphere Specific Drawbacks</span></h2><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c8">Only going to cover the notable ones here.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c8">Alteration: </span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c20">Beast Soul</span><span class="c6 c12">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c8">- can&rsquo;t use the blank form. Decreases your versatility, but gets a form talent so may be worthwhile. If you only want to grab movement modes, use this to get elemental form, which is really nice for a single talent. Combine with lycanthropic to get the talent to increase duration and you can get most of what you really need from alteration unless you are a natural attacker.</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c20">Lycanthropic </span><span class="c11 c6 c8">- you can only use alteration on yourself. Fine early on, keeping it will depend on your party composition. Sometimes it&rsquo;s handy to be able to give everyone flight for a bit, but party buffing isn&rsquo;t necessarily your job. If you can be selfish, take it.</span></p><p class="c4 c7 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c8">Conjuration:</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c0">Elongated Summoning </span><span class="c6 c8">- summoning your companion takes a minute. If you grab the talents for an all-day companion, this becomes trivial. If you want to use your companion as a combat summons, </span><span class="c6 c14">then leave it alone.</span></p><p class="c4 c7 c10"><span class="c11 c6 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c8">Creation:</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6">Limited Creation </span><span class="c6 c8">&ndash; choose either </span><span class="c6 c12">alter</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;or </span><span class="c6 c14">create</span><span class="c6 c8">. Turning a door into candy to break through more easily is too much fun and you certainly don&rsquo;</span><span class="c6 c8">t</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&nbsp;want to give up creation, so pass.</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c12">Material Focus</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;&ndash; only one type of material? Workable. Stone or iron are l</span><span class="c6">i</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">kely the most versatile options, though you can go nuts with thematics here, since even shadowstuff is an option (for all your shadowcrafting needs). I&rsquo;ve even seen this as part of a &lsquo;candy-mage&rsquo; build, which is too awesome not to mention (if the candy-mage originator reads this, drop a note to get credit!).</span></p><p class="c4 c7 c10"><span class="c11 c6 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c8">Dark:</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c12">Meld into Darkness</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&ndash; You can&rsquo;t create darkness, but can meld into any dim or darker light. In the right campaign, this could be useful, not really a fan in general.</span></p><p class="c4 c7 c10"><span class="c11 c6 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c8">Death:</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c14">Deathful Touch</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c8">&ndash; ghost strike is melee only. </span><span class="c6 c12">Workable </span><span class="c11 c6 c8">on magus builds, I hate giving up the range though.</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c20">Necromatic Limit</span><span class="c6 c14">&nbsp;</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&ndash; lose either ghost strike or reanimate. If you only want minions OR debuffs, this is great. Depends on your concept.</span></p><p class="c4 c7 c10"><span class="c11 c6 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c8">Destruction: The latter two are better for another class dabbling in destruction, not for a specialist.</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c12">Aligned Combatant </span><span class="c6 c8">- scales damage down based on how close the target is to your alignment. Campaign dependent, would be great in Wrath of the Righteous, but terrible in many others.</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c12">Energy Focus</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;- can only use on blast type. This is for being dedicated to a theme. This guide is for practical optimization, not thematics. If you take force or crystal you can get by, I suppose.</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c14">Destructive Touch</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;- you now have no range, destructive blast is touch only. Locks you out of several blast shapes and the remaining ones have to start adjacent to you. Blech. With a magus dip this can be </span><span class="c6 c12">less bad</span><span class="c6 c8">, but I still would be reluctant to lose your ranged option.</span></p><p class="c4 c7 c10"><span class="c11 c6 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c8">Divination:</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6">Limited Divination </span><span class="c6 c8">&ndash; Lose </span><span class="c6 c14">sense</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;or </span><span class="c6 c20">divine</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">. If you just want a few helpful options, you can lose divine and its choice of ridiculous casting times or spell points cost coupled with immobility.</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c12">Hidden Magic</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&nbsp;&ndash; lose the detect and read magic base abilities. Detect magic is nice to have (though much better in cantrip form rather than 10-minute casting or daily resource form). Okay if someone else can cover it easily.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c8">Enhancement:</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c12">Bodily Enhancement </span><span class="c6 c8">- can&rsquo;t target equipment or objects. Maybe very early until you buy it back.</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c20">Personal Magics</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&nbsp;- can&rsquo;t target others. Be greedy, let the full casters buff the party.</span></p><p class="c4 c7 c10"><span class="c23 c6 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c11 c6 c8">Fate:</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c20">Neutrality</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&nbsp;&ndash; can&rsquo;t use hallow. Basically, you give up protection from (alignment) for a bonus talent. If you are getting the effect consistently from elsewhere then it&rsquo;s a good idea.</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c12">Personal Fate</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;&ndash; can only target self. Okay if only dipping your toes in for a couple buffs, but you lose any of the debuffing potential of the sphere.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c8">Illusion</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c12">Disappearance </span><span class="c6 c8">- you have to take invisibility as your bonus for this drawback and can&rsquo;t use illusions for anything else. Nice for being sneaky, but illusions can be very powerful. Worth a look, but might be better to get invisibility via wand and keep your versatility.</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c14">Personal Illusions </span><span class="c11 c6 c8">- can only put illusions on yourself. Not worth it.</span></p><p class="c4 c7 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c8">Life</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c14">Limited Restoration</span><span class="c6 c12">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c8">&ndash; lose restore or cure/invigorate. The great strength of the base life sphere is how well it covers your healing needs with only the base sphere. This gimps your effects terribly. If you have to take it, keep restore and get HP healing from items, since ability damage and status conditions are harder to heal anyway.</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c14">Regenerate </span><span class="c6 c8">&ndash; </span><span class="c6 c12">doable</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&nbsp;if you already have someone in the party that can cover healing, but if you are picking up the sphere you should probably be able to use it on others as well.</span></p><p class="c4 c7 c10"><span class="c11 c6 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c8">Light</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c12">Touch of Light </span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&ndash; another one to knock range down to touch. Some effects, like blinding light, would be really annoying to have only at touch range. Others would be okay. Choose carefully.</span></p><p class="c4 c7 c10"><span class="c11 c6 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c8">Mind</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c14">Animal Shaman</span><span class="c6 c12">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c8">&ndash; affect only animals. Doesn&rsquo;t grant a talents and doesn&rsquo;t bar you from taking expanded mind, which you want right away if using the mind sphere, so this is really just for NPCs and dedicated druids types.</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c20">Empath</span><span class="c6 c14">&nbsp;</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&ndash; can&rsquo;t plant suggestions. Suggestions aren&rsquo;t bad, but if there is another charm you prefer to start with then go for it.</span></p><p class="c4 c7 c10"><span class="c11 c6 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c8">Nature</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c14">Nature Spirit </span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&ndash; Can only use spirit powers, not geomancing. Terrible. You&rsquo;ll be able to talk to anything, if you take the right talents, but lose all offensive abilities. Nope.</span></p><p class="c4 c7 c10"><span class="c11 c6 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c8">Protection</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c14">Limited Protection </span><span class="c6 c8">&ndash; Lose </span><span class="c6 c20">ward</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;or </span><span class="c6 c14">aegis</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">. If using protection primarily for long-term buffs, losing ward doesn&rsquo;t hurt too much since you will be using other actions in combat. Not sure I would give up aegis though.</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c20">Protected Soul</span><span class="c6 c14">&nbsp;</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&ndash; aegis is self only. You don&rsquo;t get many talents, buffing everyone else shouldn&rsquo;t be your job.</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c14">Aligned Protection </span><span class="c6 c8">&ndash; the sphere only works against a certain alignment. Not very good generally, but </span><span class="c0">fine in certain campaigns</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&nbsp;where 99% of enemies will be of a particular alignment (Wrath of the Righteous, for example).</span></p><p class="c4 c7 c10"><span class="c11 c6 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c8">Time</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c14">Personal Time </span><span class="c6 c8">&ndash; self only. Lose all the fun offensive uses? No thanks. If you only are grabbing time to </span><span class="c6 c20">haste yourself</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&nbsp;on a melee build it works though.</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c12">Altered Time</span><span class="c6 c14">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">&ndash; lose haste and slow options. You have other debuffs than slow and the usefulness of haste is dependent on how much of the party needs full attacks. Workable for caster-types.</span></p><p class="c4 c7 c10"><span class="c11 c6 c12"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c8">Telekinesis</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c14">Limited Telekinesis </span><span class="c11 c6 c8">- You can only use telekinesis on one type of material. Only if you are building a themed character. Hostile telekinesis is right out the window with this one.</span></p><p class="c4 c7 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c8">War</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c20">Battlefield Manipulation</span><span class="c6 c14">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c8">&ndash; lose totems, rally effects work within a radius from you. Pretty nice, actually, since you no longer have to spend an action setting up a totem and rally effects are fairly action efficient. That said, most of the sphere options are totems, so you </span><span class="c6">have a pretty limited selection.</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c20">Solo Combatant</span><span class="c6 c14">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c8">&ndash; can only rally yourself. Reroll saves, block critical hits, damage attackers, you have some decent options here. Combine with the above for some decent defenses on a martial build.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c8">Warp</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c14">Limited Warp </span><span class="c6 c8">- can only warp to areas that meet certain conditions (light, dark, water, etc). &nbsp;You have the potential to be able to start things on fire or create water, but I still can&rsquo;t recommend it since warp suffers too much if you have to spend a turn setting it up.</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c20">Personal Warp</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">- selfishness again. Nice way to get a talent to boost your mobility if you don&rsquo;t care about playing chessmaster or using the unwilling version.</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c14">Bender</span><span class="c6 c20">&nbsp;</span><span class="c11 c6 c8">&ndash; can&rsquo;t teleport.

I prefer to avoid being able to use this one, but things go south and that extra juice may make a difference.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c22 c8">Easy Focus</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;- you can maintain concentration as a move action. </span><span class="c19">Required</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;if focusing on spheres that use concentration abilities heavily, allowing you to save precious SP. If casting out of combat or not using concentration abilities, skip it.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c20">Empowered Abilities</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;- Bonus CL if you get low on spell points. Interesting way to boost yourself through the end of the day and doesn&#39;t require being near death.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6">Fortified Casting </span><span class="c6 c8">- Con as your casting stat! Too bad you can&rsquo;t take it without the draining casting drawback. If you qualify,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;take it.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c20">Overcharge </span><span class="c6 c8">- you can add +2 CL at the cost of being fatigued, then exhausted, then collapsing. Neat way to boost your power for finishing that final fight or escaping in an emergency. </span><span class="c0">Better </span><span class="c6 c8">if you have a way to quickly recover from the conditions inflicted. </span><span class="c19">Great</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;if focused on long-term buffs and other out of combat casting.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c24 c10"><span class="c21"></span></p><h1 class="c25" id="h.ihv636"><span>EQUIPMENT</span></h1><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c8">The section so many handbooks omit or never complete. This won&rsquo;t be comprehensive, just going to shoot for the highlights.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c22 c8">Mundane Gear:</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c8">Armor - chain shirt, upgrading to mithral chain shirt once you get over 18 DEX. You could go for a mithral breastplate, but you would need medium armor proficiency. If you get heavier armor, feel free to use it, though watch the max Dex, especially if you want to have good Dex for ranged attacks.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c8">Shield - get a masterwork buckler to pile enchantments on. It&rsquo;s cheap AC. Doesn&rsquo;t work for magus dips or natural attackers though. If you get proficiency from elsewhere, grab a heavier shield so long as it doesn&rsquo;t interfere with anything.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c8">Weapons &ndash; Caster-types can grab a longspear to discourage enemies from charging you or just have a dagger to hold the defending enhancement to boost your AC. An elf might want a bow for long range. A magus dipper will want a scimitar (if Str-based or dervish-dancing) or a rapier (deadly agility) for the crit range, making it keen ASAP. Dipping symbat gets you rapiers, another good choice.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c8">Misc - Rope, waterskin, mirror, marbles, nothing here but your usual adventurer kit.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c22 c8">Spheres of Power Magic Items: </span><span class="c6 c8">Spheres of Power has a re-worked magic item system to correspond with the casting system. Some games may use it exclusively, but many will use them alongside traditional items. Ultimately, you want a good staff.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c8">Scrolls - you need to have the base sphere to use a scroll without UMD, so these are mainly good for niche talents that aren&rsquo;t worth picking up to have all the time, but may save you some heartache that one time in the campaign it comes up.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c8">Wondrous Items - great for constant effects or talents that you need once or twice a day or for at-will charged items (like normal wands, sphere wands work differently).</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c8">Rods - for at-will abilities. Great for shoring up your weak points. By the upper levels you should have a golf-bag full of these for various situations.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c8">Rings - all continuous items fall here, boosting the utility of the craft rings feat. Mostly relevant if you are only using sphere items since normal wondrous items are not available for you stat boosts and other necessary effects.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c8">Wands - another way to grab talents you don&rsquo;t have for base spheres you do. Note that the DC of wand abilities is set by the wands level and your casting mod. Wands come with a small pool of spell points that the caster has to recharge, max 1/day recharge rate. </span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c0">Staves </span><span class="c6 c8">- staves work differently with spheres. Basically, they carry an enhancement bonus, like a weapon, that applies to a certain sphere. They can also be made to carry additional talents or apply to other spheres, with costs similar to weapon enchantments. You want the biggest bonus to destruction you can afford (+5 is the max, +10 equivalent with other abilities). Expanding it to cover your other favorite combat spheres is a good investment. Carry separate staves for out of combat spheres since combining them gets expensive.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c22 c8">Traditional Magic Items: </span><span class="c6 c8">Mostly, you want the standard array of stat and save boosters. Your casting should primarily be augmented with Spheres items, with the exception of metamagic rods. Note that you can use traditional scrolls and wands that correspond to your spheres and talents, though some adjudication is required from your DM.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c8">Metamagic Rods - these are handy. Because your equivalent spell level will go up as your CL does, unless you lower it willingly reducing your effects and save DCs, you will generally want to highest grade rod available for your desired effect (why extend a power if you have to cut its duration in half to use the rod?). Dazing is of course wonderful, empower and maximize are nice, rime is great if you grab the cold abilities. If it&rsquo;s good for a normal caster, it&rsquo;s probably good for you.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c8">Handy Haversack - you don&rsquo;t likely have that much strength.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c8">Muleback Cords - the other solution to carrying capacity.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c8">Stat boosters - keep your casting stat maxed, obviously, and other stats depending on build.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c8">Gauntlets of Skilled Maneuver - nice if you focus on a maneuver (dancing weapons for tripping, air blast for bullrushing, etc).</span></p><p class="c24 c7"><span class="c38"><br></span><span class="c11 c6 c8">Pauldrons of the Bull - only if you bullrush. If you do, these are amazing.</span></p><p class="c24 c7"><span class="c11 c6 c8">Amulet of Mighty Fists &ndash; only for the natural attackers, but essential for them since you can enhance all of your attacks at once.</span></p><p class="c57 c7 c10"><span class="c47 c22 c8"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c24 c10"><span class="c21"></span></p><h1 class="c25" id="h.32hioqz"><span>MULTICLASSING</span></h1><p class="c24"><span class="c11 c34 c8">As has been frequently observed in this guide, judicious multiclassing can be a significant boon. Due to the importance of caster level in the Spheres of Power system, it is strongly advised that you do not lose any caster levels unnecessarily. This severely limits the wise options for multiclassing. That said, there are options that can make significant contributions to your build. Note that losing more than three levels will cost you the final upgrade to forbidden lore, making three the most you want in a level 20 build (not that most games go to 20 or spend much time there if they do).</span></p><h2 class="c17" id="h.1hmsyys"><span class="c30">Spheres of Power Classes:</span></h2><p class="c24"><span class="c19">Incanter</span><span class="c11 c34 c8">&nbsp;drops a die size and two skill points, but gets 3 talents per 2 levels and has either bonus feats or specialization options. Specialization gets you an extra caster level and talent, so is great for boosting your favorite sphere. Using your other points to pick a domain that grants good base bonuses, like darkness (blindfight), liberation (freedom of movement), or travel (+10 movement speed), can be beneficial as well. Pay attention to which feats are lost by specializing; if you are going to lose all the feats from the levels you plan on taking, then you might as well spend all the specialization points. A one level dip here is required for getting the highest possible CL in a given sphere, if that is your goal.</span></p><p class="c24"><span class="c22 c12">Fey Adept</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c22 c12">Soul Weaver</span><span class="c11 c34 c8">&nbsp;are great classes, but offer little for a thaumaturge dip since their scaling abilities would be largely wasted. </span></p><h2 class="c17" id="h.hx6yriki57h"><span class="c30">Archetypes (SoP):</span></h2><p class="c24"><span class="c22 c12">Paladin </span><span class="c11 c34 c8">Only there for a two level dip to get divine grace, then grab advanced magic training so you only lose one CL. Getting your casting stat to saves is awesome, though the other benefits are limited.</span></p><p class="c24"><span class="c22 c12">Sphere Bard</span><span class="c11 c34 c8">&nbsp;A few rounds of performance aren&rsquo;t worth it. Losing caster levels is bad! Cha-based.</span></p><p class="c24"><span class="c22 c20">Sphere Cleric</span><span class="c11 c34 c8">&nbsp;medium armor and shields don&rsquo;t hurt, plus you can get a useful weapon with the right deity. Domains give an extra talent and has two good saves, so it&rsquo;s not a bad dip. Archetype diving might turn something up, like the crusader getting a bonus feat from a limited list (good if you want heavy armor, for example).</span></p><p class="c24"><span class="c22 c12">Sphere Druid</span><span class="c11 c34 c8">&nbsp;medium armor (non-metal only) and shields can help, plus you get some weapon proficiencies, scimitar being the most interesting. Animal companion won&rsquo;t scale, but a domain would grant a talent. Go cleric instead unless dying for skill points. </span></p><p class="c24"><span class="c19">Sphere Wizard</span><span class="c11 c34 c8">&nbsp;Upon further review, actually a very solid dip, since they get two talents at level one and a free specialization, which grants a talent also, giving three talents for one level. You like having a familiar as well to use with channel punishment as well. Great dip as long as you don&rsquo;t get saddled with the recommended tradition, potentially worthwhile even then. </span></p><h2 class="c17" id="h.2grqrue"><span class="c30">Sphere-casting Archetypes (Expanded Options):</span></h2><p class="c24"><span class="c22 c12">Sphere arcanist</span><span>&nbsp;gives a floating talent, which makes them rather unique, but they suffer from the dearth of talents just as much as the incanter. </span><span class="c11 c34 c8">The floating talents would require two levels, so stay away unless you really want the arcana you get at first level.</span></p><p class="c24"><span class="c22 c14">Sphere Bloodrager</span><span class="c14">&nbsp;</span><span class="c11 c34 c8">No! Bad player! No! (Could perhaps be usable on a melee build. Still wouldn&rsquo;t do it.) </span></p><p class="c24"><span class="c22 c12">Sphere Inquisitor</span><span class="c11 c34 c8">&nbsp;has nothing for a short dip that you wouldn&rsquo;t be better off getting somewhere else. Losing caster levels is bad! </span></p><p class="c24"><span class="c19">Sphere Magus</span><span>&nbsp;is excellent for a non-natural attack melee build. Grab two levels for spell strike and spell combat. Spell combat also neatly reduces the need to the easy focus boon. </span><span class="c14">Not great for others though</span><span>, since you do lose a caster level.

You can probably find something worthwhile. Curses do scale at half-rate with non-oracle levels, so they aren&rsquo;t as bad as they could be. Cha-based.</span></p><p class="c24"><span class="c22 c14">Sphere Summoner</span><span class="c14">&nbsp;</span><span>doesn&rsquo;t give you anything you need. Master of cosmos makes gives you a more powerful companion, while the summoner gets some neat tricks, putting them together will just detract from both.</span></p><p class="c24"><span class="c22 c12">Sphere Witch</span><span>&nbsp;is in the same boat as the shaman, minus armor proficiency, HD, and skills. Int-based.</span></p><p class="c24 c10"><span class="c11 c34 c8"></span></p><h1 class="c25" id="h.vx1227"><span>SPELLCRAFTING</span></h1><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c24"><span class="c11 c6 c8">A neat little option in the advanced magic section to allow you to combine abilities at the cost of longer casting times and spell point costs. You can only have a number made up to your casting mod, so make them count, though you can grab the spellbook feat to keep more handy. Without the spellcrafting feat, you can&rsquo;t combine different spheres, but even with the limitations you should make a few, updating them as needed as you gain talents. </span></p><p class="c24"><span class="c11 c6 c8">For destruction, I would recommend a simple combo of your favorite blasts, like force blast as the base (best damage type barring vulnerabilities) with crystal blast (to entangle, which helps offset the AC increase from prone). Combining the two is only complexity 1, so you can use it as a full-round action at no cost. Add your favorite shape in for the base ability for a second spell, say the orb shape, and you have a wide AOE blast that will do good almost never resisted damage, even to incorporeals, while knocking them prone and entangling them, at the modest cost of losing your move action that round. </span></p><p class="c24"><span class="c11 c6 c8">Note that with the spellcrafting feat, you can combine different spheres and most importantly, the base sphere sets the CL and saves of the finished spell. Charming crystal trap? Teleport an enemy and make them blink out of time for a bit? Go nuts. Just keep in mind the complexity, you don&rsquo;t want to push your casting time past a full-round action for anything to be used in combat and the spell point cost for higher complexities gets painful fast. Also note that duration is set by the base ability, so look at abilities like protection (aegis) for anchoring shorter duration buffs to get them for 1 hr/level. Even without doing this, it&rsquo;s great for doubling up buffs to save time in combat.</span></p><p class="c24"><span class="c11 c6 c8">Note that all spells are subject to DM approval. This is especially relevant for getting tricky by extending short term buffs by stacking them on protection or other spheres with hour long options.</span></p><h1 class="c25" id="h.3fwokq0"><span>SAMPLE BUILDS</span></h1><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c24"><span class="c11 c6 c8">All sample builds will be based on 20 PB for stats.</span></p><h2 class="c17" id="h.1v1yuxt"><span>Dragon Rider</span></h2><p class="c32"><span class="c11 c6 c8">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Race: Half-elf</span></p><p class="c32 c33"><span class="c11 c6 c8">Stats: Str 16+2 from levels +4 item, Dex 14, Con 14, Int 12, Wis 14, Cha 8</span></p><p class="c32"><span class="c11 c6 c8">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><a id="t.d629ccb84e7611ab96cda2c6b93f8807551c3b59"></a><a id="t.0"></a><table class="c31"><tbody><tr class="c16"><td class="c2" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c6 c8">Level</span></p></td><td class="c1" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c6 c8">Class</span></p></td><td class="c15" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c6 c8">Feat</span></p></td><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c6 c8">Talents</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c16"><td class="c2" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c6 c8">1</span></p></td><td class="c1" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c6 c8">Thaumaturge 1</span></p></td><td class="c15" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c6 c8">Level &ndash;

Warder grants martial weapons, a few maneuvers, and most importantly gives combat reflexes based on intelligence, which is necessary since the alteration size increases will reduce Dex. Reach and damage as if you are colossal. Note that you can only get one actual size increase and one effective size increase, alteration provides the actual, light the effective. When you take the warder level depends on when you start. The later you take it, the higher level maneuvers you qualify for. Size helps compensate for your medium BAB for combat maneuvers. Don&rsquo;t whip this out on an unsuspecting DM. It&rsquo;s only a martial build, but the giant threatened area may scare some people. Colossal size comes online as early as thaumaturge 7 using forbidden lore.
