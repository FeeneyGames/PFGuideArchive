We need to discuss what the Skald isn&#39;t before we get to what it is. It is neither a bard nor a barbarian. That seems odd, considering that these two classes are what were made to create the class. The Skald may have abilities akin to both of the parent classes, but it is more than the sum of those parts. That&#39;s something that people are forgetting when it comes to making Skalds. They are thinking that it&#39;s just a Bard that makes parties have Barbarian rage.</span></p><h1 class="c10" id="h.sxgkf6d6tsy0"><span class="c5">Want to make suggestions for this guide? &nbsp;</span><span class="c26 c5"><a class="c22" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://paizo.com/threads/rzs2rloh?Pseudoguide-to-the-Skald-or-How-to-be-Metal&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117526582000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0Zra4xh-lzK7uDLkzEKtj-">Join the discussion!</a></span></h1><h1 class="c23" id="h.xtqysc6wu7xb"><span>Table of Contents</span></h1><p class="c1 c7"><span class="c26"><a class="c22" href="#h.x2wgxdotbxp6">Qualities of the Skald</a></span></p><p class="c1 c7"><span class="c26"><a class="c22" href="#h.ckhe6pul6sbx">Class abilities</a></span></p><p class="c1 c7"><span class="c26"><a class="c22" href="#h.ktt9r3hggv9s">Skald Ability Scores -- Rock On, Dudes!</a></span></p><p class="c1 c7"><span class="c26"><a class="c22" href="#h.5wjotai524b7">Skald Races -- Which Are Metal?</a></span></p><p class="c1 c7"><span class="c26"><a class="c22" href="#h.q0fvf9ts5zxm">Skald Archetypes -- Genres of Metal (no nu metal allowed)</a></span></p><p class="c1 c7"><span class="c26"><a class="c22" href="#h.zdalf6twhl9e">Skalds and Traits -- Every Band Needs Some Roadies</a></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c10" id="h.x2wgxdotbxp6"><span>Q</span><span class="c13 c19">ualities of the Skald</span></h1><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Skills:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Skalds have access to the vast majority of the combined skills of the bard and barbarian, with one important caveat. Skalds, as of the recent FAQ update, have only five Perform skills available to them. Oratory, Percussion, Sing, String, and (now) Wind Instruments. However, that large list has one drawback. The Skald has only 4 + Int Mod skill ranks per level, instead of the Bard&#39;s 6 + Int Mod skill ranks. This makes choosing skills a very meticulous endeavor. The Skald will not necessarily be the knowledge monkey that the Bard can be, and Perform skills will oddly be at a premium. We will get to this later.</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Hit Points: </span><span class="c0">The Skald uses d8 hit dice, which does put it at Bard HP. You&#39;ll have powers and perhaps feats help you get around these limitations, but you will not be the tankiest guy who ever lived. I&#39;d have been happier with d10 hit dice, as it would represent the warrior poet angle the Skald was meant for a little better. But we take what we can get.</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Base Attack Bonus: </span><span class="c0">We&#39;re looking at a 3/4 BAB class here, like the Bard. Unlike the Hit Points, this is something that fits a bit better with the class design. You are reasonably certain that you can hit on average, especially in melee. This is fairly important, in that the Skald was seemingly designed to be in melee combat.</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Saves: </span><span class="c0">Skalds have excellent Fort and Will saves, and one of their class features make them both exceedingly better than most anything. That is incredibly important to know. At higher levels, a Skald at full tilt will reasonably be expected to resist most save-or-suck spells. Reflex is naturally the weakest save as a result, but Skalds can work around this limitation.</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Weapons and Armor: </span><span class="c0">Skalds are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, which gives them a diverse selection of ways to beat faces in. They also have proficiency with light and medium armors, as well as any shield that isn&#39;t the tower variety. That&#39;s a very nice selection of armor, as it does allow you to be a bit more flexible in your stat allocation.</span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Spellcasting:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Skalds have practical access to all Bard spells, and are a 6 level spellcasting class. A class ability gives them theoretical access to nearly every 6th level or lower spell in the game, but this will be expanded upon later. They are also capable of casting in medium armor starting at 1st level without penalty. That is a very important thing to note for what is essentially an arcane caster. Even the Magus can&#39;t cast in medium armor at 1st level without failure chance. They do have the bardic limitation of a verbal component in all spells.</span></p><h1 class="c10" id="h.ckhe6pul6sbx"><span class="c19 c13">Class abilities</span></h1><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Bardic Knowledge:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Skalds will need to rely more on Bardic Knowledge for most of their knowledge checks than the Bard. This is entirely due to the drop in skill ranks compared to the Bard. You might want to have a few knowledge skills trained anyway, as the bonus is a nice boost.</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Raging Song:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;This is the big one. The beginning of the major differences between the Bard and the Skald. Raging Song does act a lot like Bardic Performance, with the same scaling activation cost and interaction with feats that require Bardic Performance. Raging Song is a purely audible power, so deaf Skalds have failure chances and deaf characters are totally immune to it. However, the Skald has only 5 songs compared to the much larger number of Bardic Performances. Also, all allies that would be affected by Raging Song can choose whether or not to accept the benefits. That is a vast difference from the Bardic Performance, and allows the party to dynamically adapt to changing battlefield conditions.</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Inspired Rage:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Inspired Rage is the main Raging Song you will rely on as a Skald, unless you take the Magic Warrior archetype. I&#39;ll get to that archetype later when I discuss each of them. What Inspired Rage does is give a lesser rage like effect to allies within range of you, but without any fatigue after it ends. Will save bonus starts at +1 and goes up at 4th level and every 4 levels afterwards. The Str/Con bonus however starts at +2 at first level, and it goes up by 2 at 8th level and 16th level. AC penalty is only a -1, and never gets worse as level goes up. Barbarians and Bloodragers can note that they can instead take their own rage bonus, but cannot gain any other benefit such as rage powers or bloodrage powers from their own class. For those classes, this can be a slight benefit because they effectively have a free pool of extra rage rounds that do not fatigue them. Inspired Rage is also what helps make a Skald an effective melee combatant.</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Song of Marching: </span><span class="c0">At 3rd Level, Song of Marching can convert a single round of Raging Song to make one hour of hustle that is treated as a walk. It affects allies within 60 feet that can hear you, so it might be useful in caravans. Reduces fatigue quite a bit for long travels at low levels. It does work quite well before you have a wizard gain access to mass transit magic. It&#39;s a nice utility song, and one that you may end up using in some campaigns.</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Song of Strength:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;At 6th Level, Song of Strength allows your party to add half your Skald level to Strength checks and Strength-based skill checks. Like Song of Marching, this affects allies within 60 feet of you. I like to call this, &quot;The Song of Kicking Down the Door.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Dirge of Doom: </span><span class="c0">This is the same thing as the Bardic Performance of the same name, just two levels later. If you aren&#39;t sure about the applications of this song, just check out a number of Bard guides to this. This is honestly kind of a lackluster effect, especially when you have access to some spells and feats that do the same thing or better.</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Song of the Fallen: </span><span class="c5">Oh, this is the goods right here. At 14th level, you have a Raging Song that can resurrect allies in combat. It has a heavy cost though. One round of Raging Song per ally, per round. And when the song ends, they return to being dead. And it has the same limitations as the spell </span><span class="c3 c14">Raise Dead</span><span class="c5">. But let&#39;s be honest with ourselves. It&#39;s an excuse to break out </span><span class="c5 c28">The Flight of the Valkyries</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in the middle of a climactic boss fight. It can save the party when it matters most by bringing back that one big hitter to really mess with the BBEG&#39;s day. This is the true capstone ability of the Skald. Don&#39;t think it is an excuse for recklessness, but it can save the day when the dice just come down on your group.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c13 c17"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Scribe Scroll:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Hey, a bonus feat at 1st is nothing to sneeze at. Just remember that in PFS, this changes instead to Extra Performance. That means 6 extra rounds of Raging Song at 1st level.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Versatile Performance:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;This works mechanically just like the Bard&#39;s Versatile Performance, but it only works with the Perform skills the Skald has available to it. Also, you only get to choose at 2nd level and every 5 levels afterward. The optimal approach to this seems to be to pick one social skill to have actual max ranks in and to pick two Perform skills to cover the others. The amount of overlap makes focusing on more than two Perform skills a bit of a hassle.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Well-Versed:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;At 2nd level, the Skald gains the same resistance to sonic effects that a Bard tends to get. +4 to saves vs. Bardic Performance and all sonic or language-dependent effects. Not a major power, and easy to replace with certain archetypes.</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Rage Powers:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;This one is going to take a bit of explanation. At 3rd level and every 3 levels afterward, a Skald can gain barbarian rage powers. These rage powers can only be used with Inspired Rage, which means they can affect the whole party.</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Using Rage Powers and Restrictions: </span><span class="c0">Skalds can choose which powers apply to their Inspired Rage as they start the performance. Rage powers use the Skald&#39;s level in place of the Barbarian level for all effects depending on it, and affected allies use the Skald&#39;s ability modifiers for any rage power whose effects rely on it.</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Rage powers that require &quot;spending a standard action&quot; or costing rounds of rage to activate cannot be chosen. At all. So Terrifying Howl can&#39;t be picked up (as it costs a standard action to use), but Knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack) can be chosen. Skalds cannot, unless otherwise stated, take the same rage power more than once.</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Rage Powers from Other Sources: </span><span class="c5">Here is where I have to dispel a major myth. As written, the Skald cannot apply the rage powers of any other source to the party as part of an Inspired Rage. </span><span class="c3 c14 c35">This also counts the feat Extra Rage Power.</span><span class="c5 c35">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">I had to emphasize this because of a poster who has been claiming that there are two trains of thought regarding it. The supposed second train of thought was that it only applied to rage powers from other classes. That statement was recently disproved when the pregen Skald for PFS came out. In the 7th level version of the pregen, the Skald had Extra Rage Power. The stat block and accompanying text flat out said that the rage power granted by the feat (Witch Hunter) could not be shared with the party. Therefore, rage powers coming from feats and other classes cannot be shared during an Inspired Rage.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">In contrast, a Skald with levels in Barbarian or Bloodrager can apply his Skald rage powers to the Barbarian Rage or Bloodrage. As they would only affect himself in that instance, it is allowed.</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Linnorm Death Curses: </span><span class="c0">Linnorm Death Curses are a special subset of rage power introduced in the Advanced Class Guide. As Skald rage powers, it allows allies to have an interesting effect. In most cases, the Linnorm Death Curse will grant you and your allies a single point of specific damage types to melee attacks. The real fascinating thing involves the second power of the Linnorm Death Curses. When a player affected by it is knocked unconscious or killed by an attack or spell, the attacker/assailant will have to make a Will save or be affected by the Curse. Each curse is named after a different Linnorm, and thus has different curse effects. Several produce vulnerability to an energy type, although the Tor Death Curse also permanently staggers the opponent. The Cairn Death Curse causes Con damage and ages the cursed one year per day. The Fjord Death Curse makes the opponent drown easier in the water. And the Tarn Death Curse flat out makes an enemy completely unable to heal in any way until the curse is removed. No healing spells, and no ability to heal naturally from rest. That makes the death curses something special when things go wrong, but you may see them more in NPC villain characters.</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Uncanny Dodge/Improved Uncanny Dodge:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;This is self-explanatory here. Works the same as for Barbarians, and scales the same as the Rogue. Solid ability to keep the Skald from being in some bad situations.</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Spell Kenning:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;This is the ability that at 5th level gives the Skald a truly unique situation. Starting at once per day, the Skald can take one of his spell slots and cast any appropriate level spell from the Bard, Cleric, or Sorc/Wiz spell lists. As I said in the spell section, the Skald has theoretical access to near every 6th level or lower spell in the game. At 11th and 17th level, you gain an additional use of this power. There is a catch though for this unprecedented spell access. No matter what the spell cast by this ability will be, you have a minimum cast time of one round to cast it. That&#39;s been seen as a major failing, but is largely irrelevant in certain circumstances. Any spells that already have one round or longer cast times are unaffected by this drawback.</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Lore Master:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;This is the same ability that Bards get, but only scaled back to being two levels behind the Bard. So that means you get it at 7th level, and it improves at 13th level and 19th level.</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Damage Reduction:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The Skald first gains DR 1/- at 9th level, and it increases by one at 14th and 19th levels. This can be further improved with the Improved Damage Reduction rage power, but only during an Inspired Rage.</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Master Skald:</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;The official capstone of the Skald, Master Skald does a lot at 20th level when using Inspired Rage. AC Penalty is completely removed, even though it was at that point a negligible thing. Barbarians and Bloodragers can gain the full benefit of their raging if they choose to use the Inspired Rage as the source. So Dragonic Bloodragers will turn into dragons, and they can cast their spells while under the Inspired Rage. Finally, all players under the effects of Inspired Rage can make one extra attack while full attacking as if under the effect of </span><span class="c3 c14">haste.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Not too bad, as far as level 20 capstones go.</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c10" id="h.ktt9r3hggv9s"><span>Skald Ability Scores -- Rock On, Dudes!</span></h1><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Before I continue onto the Races, I realize I need to take care of analyzing the relevance of the ability scores. Because trust me, the Skald has MAD issues. Pretty serious ones at that.</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Strength:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Barring the use of the Spell Warrior archetype, Strength is likely to be your highest or second highest ability score. Skalds are more likely to be in the front line to wade through combat. Your Inspired Rage can supplement lower Strength scores, but you generally want at least a 14 Strength to start. A 16 would be better.</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Dexterity:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Dexterity governs a few things for Skalds. A few skills key off of Dex, as does Initiative and some of your Armor Class. Helps with ranged combat, which is often going to be the route you&#39;ll want to take with the oft mentioned Spell Warrior. For a melee build, you can typically get away with a 12 Dexterity. But you&#39;ll want a 15 for Two-Weapon Fighting if you plan on going that route.</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Constitution:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;You are not dumping this, ever. This governs your HP, your Fort save, and how long you can make saving throws until death. The Skald&#39;s Inspired Rage already buffs this up a bit, so you will often have some extra HP to help you out. You can have this as low as about 12-13 if you feel like it.</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Intelligence:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Given the relatively low number of skill ranks a Skald receives, this should not be dumped at all. A base 10 is also not recommended. It&#39;s just too low for a class that has a number of skills it wants to have ranks in. A 12 should be the magic minimum number, but 14 is the most you&#39;ll want to go without magic item assistance.</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Wisdom:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Despite it affecting your Will save, Wisdom is your only genuine dump stat as a Skald. Your Inspired Rage will be able to make up the difference in that regard. Won&#39;t help much with Perception, but it is thankfully a class skill for the Skald.</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Charisma:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Let me put it as blunt as I can. The base minimum Charisma for an effective Skald is 14, no less. It governs your spells, your rounds of Raging Song, and the DCs of any ability you get that need it. It helps you perform to the best of your ability, even at the worst of times.</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Well, that takes care of that boring part. Now we get to have fun picking apart the races. As this is a more rudimentary guide, I&#39;m focusing solely on the base races. Less headaches are involved.</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c10" id="h.5wjotai524b7"><span>Skald Races -- Which Are Metal?</span></h1><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Dwarves:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Dwarves have beards, which makes them typically manly and capable of a ZZ Top impersonation. If I could only determine what makes a good Skald with that, then these guys would be close to the top of the heap. But it would be a disservice to the vikings that inspired the Skald if I did that. Dwarves do not make very good Skalds. They get Darkvision, Hardy, and an expanded weapon selection. They can bump up the Con, which is nice. However, they get an increase in our dump stat and a decrease in the stat we must never let go below 14. That&#39;s a bad sign, because we must then make the Skald overall weaker just to accommodate that. Coupled with a bad Favored Class Bonus that takes 10 levels to give you heavy armor with only a slightly lesser arcane failure chance, and I can&#39;t recommend it as a Skald.</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Elves:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Elves are lanky, long haired folk who look like they might have been in a few 80s hair bands. They are only slightly metal. They give an increase to Dexterity and Intelligence, while having a dip in Constitution. That isn&#39;t as bad as you might think. Just a simple re-allocation of stats and it becomes manageable. Racial traits aren&#39;t too shabby either. Bonus to Perception, saves vs enchantment effects, low light vision, and even to spell penetration checks. And you can get rid of that last one to give yourself a few extra spell like abilities per day. The only drawback to that is on the Favored Class Bonus, which can improve the Well-Versed ability by 1 point every 4 levels. Other than that, I&#39;d only recommend the Elf for archer Skalds.</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Gnomes:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The closest thing to a metal Gnome is the 1980s version of Alvin and the Chipmunks, or perhaps the Oompa Loompas in the Tim Burton version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Gnomes don&#39;t have manly beards, nor big enough hair to make a hair band. Stat wise, it&#39;s a mixed bag as well. Strength gets dipped, but Con and Cha go up. Favored Class Bonus is simply a bonus to concentration checks for your Skald spells. Other racial traits aren&#39;t that impressive either. It&#39;s really suited for a caster Skald, which sort of goes against the grain for the class. It might be good for a certain archetype when I get to them.</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Half-Elves:</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Half-elves can have the long hair of the elves, or be at more reasonable hair length. And they can be more muscular than the lanky elves. So these guys could have fit in an 80s metal band. They get a floating bonus that may end up in Strength more often than not. They do get a free Skill Focus, which could go into making their primary perform skill. They also have the resistance to sleep and enchantment, as well as the buff to Perception. And best of all, they have the best Favored Class Bonus. They can add more rounds of Raging Song. That&#39;s more time for the band to perform. That&#39;s encores. When a half-elf plays </span><span class="c5 c28">Stairway to Heaven</span><span class="c0">, they are never denied.</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Half-Orcs:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Half-orcs are metal. They are thrash metal incarnate. The loudest headbangers known to man. Dethlok would want one of these guys just because they fit the motif of their place. Racially, the half-orc is practically ideal to the Skald. Same floating bonus as the half-elf, and they get a number of great abilities. They get a bonus on Intimidate checks, Darkvision, and Orc Ferocity. If that wasn&#39;t enough, they can switch things up by getting rid of Darkvision for extra skill ranks or the Ferocity for a luck bonus to all saves. By the way, that bonus to saves comes in the form of tattoos. So everything is so far screaming metal here. And on top of all that, they get the same Favored Class Bonus as the half-elf. So the half-orc will have more rounds of the heaviest metal this side of Brutal Legend.</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Halflings:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Halflings are in the same boat as the Gnomes as far as how metal they are. And their stats just don&#39;t help. Bonus to a mostly irrelevent stat and your casting stat, and a penalty to one of your primary stats do not make a solid Skald. It might be fine in an archery build. The racial traits are a little okay, with the bonus to all saves and a further bonus versus fear. Favored Class Bonus is sadly the nail in the coffin here. Just a bonus on critical confirmation rolls for a very small number of weapons. At best two weapons, and it doesn&#39;t stack with Critical Focus.</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Humans:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Humans brought forth the viking, one of the inspirations for a number of metal songs. Seeing as the Skald is my excuse to play Manowar or Blind Guardian at the table for a buff class, it&#39;s fitting to say that humans are the inspiration for metal. They have the same floating bonus that the half-elf and half-orc get, but they also get a bonus feat and extra skill ranks. The Favored Class Bonus for the human is actually a bit disappointing and bland, as it is merely bonus to spells known. Spell Kenning already makes that mostly useless, unless you take an archetype that removes it.</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">These next few races don&rsquo;t have any favored class options for the Skald, so they are immediately not as metal as our most metal races (Half-Elf, Half-Orc, Human). &nbsp;But they can rock out in their own way. &nbsp;Consider most races not listed here to be horrible as Skalds.</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Aasimar:</span><span class="c5">&nbsp; The base Aasimar isn&rsquo;t that metal. &nbsp;Sure they have the flowing hair option, and can look like a glam band. &nbsp;But the base version is more of a poser, at best some kind of alt rock group. &nbsp;Thankfully, Blood of Angels has a few versions that are more metal for us. &nbsp;Angelkin are exceptionally good looking and strong, so they may have enough Viking in them to work. &nbsp;And they have </span><span class="c3 c14">Alter Self</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;as a spell-like ability, so they can hide from fanatic groupies. &nbsp;Emberkin Aasimar are a bit more suited for knowing what will please the crowds, and they have </span><span class="c3 c14">Pyrotechnics</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;as their spell-like ability. &nbsp;They could easily make good roadies.</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Nagaji:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; Lizardmen are metal in their own way. &nbsp;Kinda hard not to imagine one shredding on a guitar or screaming out lyrics. &nbsp;That, and it isn&rsquo;t hard to imagine them with a Gene Simmons tongue. &nbsp;They&rsquo;re strong and charismatic, but the Intelligence is going to need some work to be passable. &nbsp;They got a tough hide, so they won&rsquo;t get scratched nearly as much by thrown beer bottles.</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Skinwalkers:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; Heavy Metal is filled with mythical references, especially in the early days. &nbsp;And Skinwalkers sounds like an awesome album title. &nbsp;The catch is to find the best subraces to apply to the Skald. &nbsp;One would think the Witchwolf (awesome name) would be perfect, but it sadly is one of the worst options. &nbsp;Scaleheart and Fanglord are the only two genuinely viable Skinwalker subraces to be a Skald. &nbsp;Scaleheart is the winner though, as you can shapeshift into optimal bat biting form.</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Tiefling:</span><span class="c5">&nbsp; We have a race with built in devil horns. &nbsp;How metal is that? &nbsp;And we can turn an utterly useless feature into a tail! &nbsp;But stat wise, the baseline Tiefling sucks in a band. &nbsp;They either didn&rsquo;t get the rhythm right on drums, or their guitar wasn&rsquo;t properly tuned. &nbsp;Pitborn are workable, but they need to learn up that intelligence to not suck in the band. &nbsp;Beastbrood are also good at reading the audience and evading the crazed fans, though in a fight he seems a bit better for the rare archer build.</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The continuation of this quasi-guide will involve Archetypes, relevant Traits, relevant Feats, and perhaps an example of some of the builds.</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c10" id="h.q0fvf9ts5zxm"><span class="c19 c13">Skald Archetypes -- Genres of Metal (no nu metal allowed)</span></h1><p class="c4"><span class="c0">For any class discussion to be fair and more balanced, we have to discuss the archetypes in equal measure. &nbsp;In music terms, the archetype is more of a subgenre of the particular musical style.</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c15 c37">Fated Champion:</span><span class="c5">&nbsp; The Fated Champion is the fervent lorekeeper whose study of history and legend has granted them insight into the trappings of fate and fortune. &nbsp;These are the epic poets who write ballads of tales that have happened, are happening, and can happen in the future. &nbsp;They are the destined musicians who change the face of music in beautiful and sometimes frightening ways. &nbsp;Led Zeppelin and Iron Maiden are great examples of the Fated Champion in music. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Watcher of the Weave:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; The Fated Champion forgoes the Well-Versed ability to grant themselves an insight bonus on Initiative checks. &nbsp;This bonus is equal to &frac12; the Skald&rsquo;s level, and is representative of the Fated Champion&rsquo;s ability to see the tapestry of fate.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Far Seer:</span><span class="c5">&nbsp; Divination is a powerful tool for the Fated Champion, and nowhere does this show than in their version of Spell Kenning. &nbsp;When a Fated Champion searches through all their stories and legends to find a spell, they can cast divination spells that specifically can be used to foretell the future at a spell slot of one spell level lower. &nbsp;So a Fated Champion is actually perfect to using </span><span class="c3 c14">Harrowing</span><span class="c5">, </span><span class="c3 c14">Augury</span><span class="c5">, and </span><span class="c3 c14">Divination</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;spells. &nbsp;The drawback to this is that when you want to cast a spell that directly damages enemies, that spell is cast in a higher level spell slot. &nbsp;So you&rsquo;re not one for pyrotechnic displays. &nbsp;Summoning should still work as normal through Spell Kenning.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Shield of Foresight:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; The Fated Champion is so secure in his destiny that he fears nothing, especially when he is in the middle of a performance. &nbsp;In exchange for the Dirge of Doom, the Fated Champion gains a new Raging Song use. &nbsp;When performing Raging Song, the Fated Champion gains immunity to fear. &nbsp;In addition, allies within 60 feet of the Skald gain a + 5 bonus on saves vs fear effects.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Not this Day:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; At 20th level, the Fated Champion gains the power of rerolls. &nbsp;For 10 rounds of Raging Song, the Skald can then force a reroll of a saving throw or an opponent&rsquo;s attack roll before the results are announced. &nbsp;Honestly for 10 rounds per reroll, I&rsquo;d have thought we could at least control which result to keep. &nbsp;Not the case, as we must accept the second roll.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c15 c33">Herald of the Horn:</span><span class="c3 c24">&nbsp; </span><span class="c0">A Herald of the Horn is supposed to be loud. &nbsp;Like packed arena loud. &nbsp;Mechanically, the Herald of the Horn is actually surprisingly lackluster. &nbsp;Only a couple things are actually worth what the Skald loses in this archetype, but man are they worth playing. &nbsp;For PFS, this is completely unrecommended. &nbsp;The really good powers don&rsquo;t show until retirement for the PFS Skald. &nbsp;So this archetype is better suited for Adventure Paths and home campaigns. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s also odd in that an archetype mostly maximized for spellcasting gets rid of the best reason to be a spellcasting Skald. &nbsp;It might make a good archetype for Gnomes and Halflings to take.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Arcane Bond:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; Instead of being able to Scribe Scroll, the Herald of the Horn Skald gets a fee horn that acts as a bonded item. &nbsp;This acts the same as if it were a wand, weapon, or stave as a wizard/sorcerer&rsquo;s bonded item. &nbsp;Meaning, you have to hold it in hand to cast a Skald spell. &nbsp;This is a bad power, and even worse in PFS. &nbsp;Because it replaces Scribe Scroll, that means it replaces the Extra Performance bonus feat for PFS. &nbsp;That is 6 rounds less of Raging Song.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Rousing Retort:</span><span class="c5">&nbsp; At 5th level, the Herald of the Horn loses the first use of Spell Kenning in order to gain a new tool in the Raging Song arsenal. &nbsp;When you start a Raging Song, you can spend another 4 rounds of the power to give allies within 60 feet a reroll against an ongoing enchantment or fear effect with a +2 bonus. &nbsp;While this power is actually kinda useful, it demands having a lot of rounds of Raging Song. &nbsp;Note my earlier statement for Arcane Bond in PFS? &nbsp;This makes that feature even worse.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Horn Call:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; At 7th level, the Herald&rsquo;s horn improves the DCs of spells with the Sonic descriptor by 1. &nbsp;This goes up by another 1 at 13th and 19th levels. &nbsp;However, you do get rid of Lore Master. &nbsp;That means you will always be rolling to see if you can glean information, even the mundane stuff. &nbsp;Honestly, it&rsquo;s not really worth it. &nbsp;There aren&rsquo;t as many spells with the Sonic descriptor that you&rsquo;d want to use it with.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Crumbling Blast:</span><span class="c5">&nbsp; This is the reason one would even consider the Herald of the Horn. &nbsp;In exchange for the other two uses of Spell Kenning, your Skald will be able to use his/her horn as a </span><span class="c3 c24">Horn of Blasting</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;with a decently scaling DC. &nbsp;It starts off as a regular </span><span class="c3 c24">Horn of Blasting</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;at 11th level, and it grows into the Greater version at level 17. &nbsp;The horn does not have a chance to self-destruct while you use it, so feel free to blast the Walls of Jericho. &nbsp;Or call Charlemagne.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c15 c29">Magic Warrior:</span><span class="c5">&nbsp; The Magic Warrior is a strange archetype for the Skald. &nbsp;Mechanically, I can at best put it as a weapon buffing/enemy debuff build. &nbsp;It puts it in the unique place of being the only archetype I could recommend for Archer Skalds and it can act as a caster type as well. &nbsp;He may be called the Magic Warrior, but he&rsquo;s more of an anti-magic character. &nbsp;As for how metal he is, the Magic Warrior is the guy who is hanging around with the Wizard to tell his tales in song. &nbsp;At least one verse from </span><span class="c5 c28">Valhalla</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;by Blind Guardian can fit that mold. &nbsp;More of the mystic side of Metal than the usual facemelting and headbanging, though it can fit some of that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Improved Counterspell:</span><span class="c5">&nbsp; Instead of Scribe Scroll (or Extra Performance for PFS), the Magic Warrior Skald gets Improved Counterspell as a feat. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s not too shabby, to be fair. &nbsp;The enemy debuff thing I mentioned was more that counterspelling is a very important part of the archetype&rsquo;s play style.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Weapon Song:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; This is the only archetype that flat out replaces Inspired Rage with anything, so it better be worth it. &nbsp;Making all allies weapons and ammunition have a +1 magic bonus seems to be a start. &nbsp;As the Skald hits 5th level and every 5 after, this bonus can improve. &nbsp;It does have a drawback in that this further increase is affected by how many weapons are buffed. &nbsp;On the plus side, that bonus could be turned into special weapon abilities when you start. &nbsp;You choose the buff size and any special abilities when you begin a song. &nbsp;Another thing of note is that Weapon Song replaces the Inspired Rage for the purposes of using Skald rage powers, so you don&rsquo;t lose that feature. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a little awkwardly worded in the book, but the addition of recommended rage powers indicates that you use them with Weapon Song.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Greater Counterspell:</span><span class="c5">&nbsp; In exchange for the entirety of Spell Kenning, the Magic Warrior gains greater versatility in counterspelling. &nbsp;It starts off with being able to expend two Skald spell slots of the same level or higher than the spell, but you don&rsquo;t have to worry about the spell school. &nbsp;Useful when you don&rsquo;t have </span><span class="c3 c14">Dispel Magic</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and face off against an Evocation caster. &nbsp;This improves at 11th level, where you only need to burn one spell slot. &nbsp;And finally at 17th level, you gain Parry Spell as a bonus feat and ignore any other prerequisites for it. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll likely make both anyhow, but it&rsquo;s nice to see that you don&rsquo;t need to worry about it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Song of Arcane Manipulation:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; Instead of Dirge of Doom, the Magic Warrior Skald can counterspell as an immediate action without interrupting his Raging Song. &nbsp;That means that while you are buffing weapons, you get a chance to stop a spell. &nbsp;However, it is costly. &nbsp;It not only costs you the spell slot or slots you are using to counterspell, but it also costs you rounds of Raging Song equal to the countered spell&rsquo;s level. &nbsp;So a 3rd level spell will cost you a 3rd level or higher spell slot and 3 rounds of Raging Song.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Spell Tamper:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; As the Capstone of the Spell Warrior, the Skald loses Master Skald to add another effect to his counterspell successes. &nbsp;When the counterspell succeeds, the opponent takes 1d6 damage per level of the countered spell. &nbsp;A Will save only halves the damage, and it bypasses damage reduction or energy resistance. &nbsp;It is pure arcane energy being disrupted there.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c15 c20">Totemic Skald:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; The Totemic Skald is a very cool archetype. &nbsp;The Skald has literally 12 different flavors with this one alone. &nbsp;You can support skirmishers, archers, scouts, tanky guys, and a number of things in between. &nbsp;If not for one glaring area, everything you lose would have been a bargain for what you gained.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Totem:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; Instead of the normal Rage Power at 3rd level, the Totemic Skald picks an animal focus from the Hunter&rsquo;s list. &nbsp;This cannot be changed once selected, and it affects all the other abilities the Totemic Skald gains. &nbsp;When the Skald is raging, that focus gives him a rage power that gifts the party with the effect of that Animal Focus. &nbsp;And it scales with level by using the Skald level in place of Hunter level. &nbsp;So someone with the Stag totem will grant a 5 foot enhancement bonus that will eventually grow up to a 20 foot bonus. &nbsp;Or the Tiger totem granting a +2 to +6 enhancement bonus to Dexterity.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Totem Empathy:</span><span class="c5">&nbsp; This is admittedly the weakest ability of the Totemic Skald. &nbsp;The Skald gains a limited form of a Druid&rsquo;s Wild Empathy, which only affects animals matching the totem selected at 3rd level. &nbsp;You also get a one per day use of </span><span class="c3 c14">Charm Animal</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;that again only works on animals of the same type. &nbsp;It can go up to 5/day by 20th. &nbsp;This is not actually worth losing Uncanny Dodge and Improved Uncanny Dodge.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Wild Shape:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; This one is pretty damn metal here. &nbsp;You can turn into a Small or Medium sized version of your Totem animal. &nbsp;In place of the Spell Kenning ability, you gain this limited version of Wild Shape which acts at a Druid level equal to your Skald level -1. &nbsp;The Skald starts with one use per day of this Wild Shape at 5th level, but gains a second use at 11th level and a third use at 17th level &nbsp;You can use Raging Song while in this animal form, but spell casting won&rsquo;t work normally. &nbsp;You can qualify for feats that require the Wild Shape ability, like Wild Speech and Natural Spell. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c15 c35">Bekyar </span><span class="c3 c15 c33">Demon Dancer:</span><span class="c5">&nbsp; The Bekyar Demon Dancer, or Demon Dancer for short, is meant specifically for evil Skalds or evil parties. &nbsp;There are some interesting abilities to be fair, but you will likely not be using this archetype for PFS. &nbsp;More precisely because you are a follower of a demon. &nbsp;The Demon Dancer can make for a solid archetype for Skald villains, especially in any Mwangi set adventures. &nbsp;Think Norwegian Death Metal in Golarian. &nbsp; </span><span class="c13 c3 c18">As of 12/15/2014, this archetype is not legal for PFS.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c16">Skills:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; The Demon Dancer gains the skill Perform (Dance) as a class skill without removing any class skills.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c16">Versatile Performance:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; Demon Dancers can pick Perform (Dance) for their Versatile Performance, which lets them replace Acrobatics and Fly checks with the perform skill. &nbsp;This is the only alteration to Versatile Performance it receives. &nbsp;Nothing lost, just gained. &nbsp;Semi-useful if you expect the Skald to tumble around or perform aerial battles.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c16">Fiendish Maw:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; In lieu of the first Rage Power the Skald would receive, the Demon Dancer gives all who accept to his Inspired Rage a larger scale bite attack. &nbsp;For medium creatures, it starts as a 1d6 at 3rd level and grows to 1d8 at 7th level. &nbsp;At 12th level, the bite grows to 2d6; and it caps at 3d6 at 17th level. &nbsp;This bite will not grow any further due to size increases. &nbsp;And as a natural attack, you&rsquo;d take a -5 penalty to bite as part of a full round attack. &nbsp;This is actually not a bad ability here. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s a solid boost to damage if you need it, like an instance where the group has lost their weapons.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c16">Abyssal Wrath:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; The Demon Dancer loses yet another two rage powers at levels 6 and 9 for the Abyss Totem and Greater Abyss Totem rage powers. &nbsp;Abyss Totem is a nice retributive effect that the rage helps with. &nbsp;Greater Abyss Totem is what makes the Demon Dancer a bit more solid as a villain and a bane for good parties. &nbsp;You don&rsquo;t want the party to clump around together if you have this power active, as they&rsquo;d end up either shakened or shakened and taking damage from each other. &nbsp;Worse, it won&rsquo;t hurt or shaken any evil creatures.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c16">Demonic Conquest:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; At 7th level, the Demon Dancer adds another double-edged ability to their Inspired Rage. &nbsp;Every person who accepts the rage will have a choice to make whenever they attack an enemy. &nbsp;They can either attempt a scaling Will save (10 +&frac12; Skald level + Cha modifier), or succumb to a desire to dominate the enemy. &nbsp;On a failed save or the choice to accept this urge, the Strength and Constitution bonuses increase by 2; but the affected cannot swap to another target. &nbsp;And when the enemy is defeated, the affected ally must then take a full round action to burn or carve the symbol of the Demon Dancer&rsquo;s chosen demon onto the enemy&rsquo;s flesh. &nbsp;This compulsion can only end once the symbol is carved, or the Skald stops performing. &nbsp;This is a really double-edged sword, and can possibly be worse if Lingering Performance or a similar trait kicks in. &nbsp;You might not be able to resist doing this.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c15 c20">Belkzen War Drummer:</span><span class="c5">&nbsp; Every band needs a drummer, and this is Orcish/Half-orcish drummer goodness here. &nbsp;If you want to play a Skald more focused on being a scarily awesome drummer who uses greatclubs as his drumsticks, this is your build here. &nbsp;Also, this archetype can stack with Fated Champion. &nbsp;So you can make a Half-Orc who seems fated to become Keith Moon meets every metal drummer known to man. &nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c18">As of 12/15/2014, this archetype has received the go-ahead for PFS.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c16">Weapon Proficiency:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; The War Drummer actually loses most of their weapon proficiencies. &nbsp;They are only proficient with simple weapons and the greatclub. &nbsp;Note that the greatclub is already a martial weapon. &nbsp;Take advantage of the weapon proficiencies that Half-Orcs get in case you want more than the greatclub.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c16">Fearsome Mien:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; The War Drummer loses Bardic Knowledge for &frac12; the level bonus to Intimidate and Bluff checks. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know how I feel about this one. &nbsp;The Versatile Performances you gain are likely to make this useless. &nbsp;From a cultural perspective, it makes sense. &nbsp;Just not as nice as I&rsquo;d like to see.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c16">Deadly Rhythm:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; This is actually kinda cool. &nbsp;The War Drummer loses Scribe Scroll (or bonus Extra Performance in PFS) to effectively have Quick Draw for clubs and the greatclub while using Raging Song. &nbsp;At 3rd level, it also gains a scaling bonus on damage rolls with clubs and the greatclub up to a +5 at 17th level. &nbsp;And at 6th level, it gains Improved Critical with clubs or the greatclub as a bonus feat. &nbsp;Losing one feat for that much is actually a big thing, especially for a 1st level swap. &nbsp;Prepare to use dragon skulls for your drum kit.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c16">Weapon Master:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; Unlike what the name of the ability states, the War Drummer only gets Craft Magic Arms and Armor at 7th level as a bonus feat. &nbsp;This replaces Lore Master, which kinda sucks because this archetype really forgoes any knowledge bonuses or assists. &nbsp;Drummers just drum, man.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c16">Siege Drums Raging Song:</span><span class="c5">&nbsp; At 7th level, the War Drummer gives up their additional Versatile Performance at that level for the ability to break walls with the power of his drum solo. &nbsp;This performance acts like the </span><span class="c3 c14">Shatter</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;spell, but the effect is greater when the War Drummer plays longer. &nbsp;The rounds you can add to increase the power of the Raging Song is limited to 10, mostly so you don&rsquo;t wreck through your rounds just to bust down a wall. &nbsp;This epic shattering effect only goes off when you finish performing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c15 c20">Dragon Skald:</span><span class="c5">&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be honest here. &nbsp;The Dragon Skald is a niche archetype, but it does its job surprisingly well. &nbsp;This is for the seafaring viking badass that can smooth inroads for party members while resisting attempts at scaring him away. &nbsp;If you are playing in an AP like Jade Regent or more importantly Skull &amp; Shackles, this is probably the Skald for you. &nbsp;The only major issue I have is that none of the abilities of the Dragon Skald center around fighting dragons. &nbsp;</span><span class="c13 c3 c18">As of 12/15/2014, this archetype has received the go-ahead for PFS.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c16">Wind Whistler:</span><span class="c5">&nbsp; At 1st level, the Dragon Skald gives up Scribe Scroll (or Extra Performance for PFS) to gain access to </span><span class="c3 c14">Alter Winds, Fog Cloud, and Obscuring Mist</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in their class spell list. &nbsp;They come in at the same spell levels as a wizard gets them, and the Skald still must pick up the spell as normal for the class. &nbsp;This is okay for the Human Dragon Skald, as the favored class bonus will be used at later levels. &nbsp;For sailing and evasion, this works out well.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c16">Sea Legs:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; Dragon Skalds also get rid of Bardic Knowledge for a number of bonuses to seafaring life. &nbsp;They can add &frac12; their class level as a bonus to all Profession (Sailor) checks, Survival checks at sea, Acrobatics and Climb checks made while on a boat, and Swim checks. &nbsp;Dragon Skalds make great sailors as a result, so we have an excuse to make viking swashbuckling adventures. &nbsp;The number of benefits here actually come close to making up for the loss of Bardic Knowledge.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c16">Fearless Raider:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; At 2nd level, the Dragon Skald replaces Well-Versed with a greater resistance to fear effects. &nbsp;He gets a +4 bonus to saving throws against fear effects, and DCs to use the Intimidate skill against him are raised by 4. &nbsp;Okay, this might be the only thing that can be even remotely related to fighting dragons. &nbsp;Still, it makes the Dragon Skald tough to scare off.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c16">Glorious Epic Raging Song:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; At 3rd level, the Dragon Skald loses the Song of Marching for a Glorious Epic. &nbsp;With a cost of a single round of Raging Song, the Dragon Skald goes into a 10 minute epic song or poem. &nbsp;This performance is meant to showcase just how awesome the subject of it is. &nbsp;You kinda want that to be either an important NPC, a party member, or yourself. &nbsp;At the end of that performance, the subject of the epic gains a bonus on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks equal to the Will save bonus granted by the Skald&rsquo;s Inspired Rage against others who have listened to the full performance. &nbsp;In some ways, the Dragon Skald could be the ultimate wingman at the bar.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c23" id="h.zdalf6twhl9e"><span>Skalds and Traits -- Every Band Needs Some Roadies</span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are a lot of feats. &nbsp;A LOT of them. &nbsp;Like over 1,000 traits scattered between dozens of books. &nbsp;From Campaign Traits, to Racial Traits, to every little thing in-between. &nbsp;Hell, there&rsquo;s even Equipment Traits. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s honestly too many to accurately parse through to find the best out there for your Skald. &nbsp;So I&rsquo;ll instead give a little advice and list some of the best Traits I can figure for Skalds, and I&rsquo;ll even throw in a bit of my reasoning behind those decisions. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For PFS, I recommend taking a look at the Guide to Organized Play. &nbsp;Each Faction has its own list of Traits available for their members, and some of them are either flavorful or mechanically relevant to your Skald. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve seen a few that could be kinda badass for the PFS Skald, and looking at the factions can inspire your Skald to have certain quirks behind it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For Adventure Paths, never underestimate the value of the Campaign Traits. &nbsp;To use the Mummy&rsquo;s Mask example, there are two traits that provide great bonuses. &nbsp;Trap Finder gives you an extra skill, a bonus to said skill, and the ability to completely replace the rogue in the trap disarming department. &nbsp;But Sphinx Riddler has an interesting blanket bonus. &nbsp;That Trait allows you to gain a bonus when using your Bluff and Diplomacy on Sphinxes, and it gives you a universal +1 to all checks to solve riddles and puzzles on top of a bonus language. &nbsp;Those are the hallmarks of great, flavorful Traits in any AP.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And now onto the Traits themselves that I can be certain are solid.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12 c3">Combat Traits</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c20">Armor Expert:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp; </span><span class="c0">Let&rsquo;s be fair, you are going to wear armor. &nbsp;It may or may not be medium armor, but I can be fairly certain that there will be Armor Check Penalties on some of your skills. &nbsp;This reduces the penalty by 1, and it stacks with any other penalty reductions the armor may already have. &nbsp;So a Mythril Breastplate will have no ACP in your hands. &nbsp;Not bad.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8">Deft Dodger/Resilient:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; While you can only pick one of these two Traits, they are both great. &nbsp;Deft Dodger helps you dodge Fireballs and slipping on Grease. &nbsp;Dodging Fireballs or tanking them is metal. &nbsp;Slipping on a spot of Grease? &nbsp;Not so much. &nbsp;And Resilient helps make one of your best saves even better. &nbsp;Now you have better odds of outdrinking a Dwarven hammersmith.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c20 c16">Disillusioned:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;In many ways, the Skald should be a stone cold badass. &nbsp;A +2 to Will saves versus emotion and fear effects helps drive that point home.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c37">Reactionary:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a +2 to Initiative, and the sooner you act, the sooner you can start facemelting the enemy. &nbsp;It goes without saying that this is one of the best traits you can get your hands on.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c11">Muscle of the Society:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; This is more of a flavor Trait than a totally useful one, but there is some value. &nbsp;You can have a +2 bonus to Strength checks to kick down the doors and lift portcullises, which you will likely only be using to kick down doors to make an entrance. &nbsp;It also raises your carrying capacity as if you only had 2 more Strength. &nbsp;It could stack with a Masterwork Backpack to make you a substitute for a mule.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c12">Faith Traits</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c20 c16">Birthmark/Focused Disciple:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; Bands lose a lot of money due to being shafted in a contract because the manager distracted them with sex, drugs, and of course rock and roll. &nbsp;This Trait gives a +2 to saves against charm and compulsion effects. &nbsp;Granted, the Skald isn&rsquo;t normally going to take advantage of the holy symbol aspect of the Birthmark. &nbsp;You can still turn it into the subject of a funny story.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8">Fate&rsquo;s Favored:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; This is the big one if you are a Half-orc Skald, especially when you take the Sacred Tattoo alternate racial trait. &nbsp;Any source of luck bonuses gets an upgrade from this Trait. &nbsp;Destiny is literally calling out to Skalds to pick this up, as there are other ways to get luck bonuses.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c20 c16">Reincarnated:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; Bands typically do things that bring them close to death, and they do so with seemingly no fear. &nbsp;This trait lets your Skald do some of the same with a +2 bonus to saving throws against fear and death effects.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c20 c16">Spirit Sense:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t want to be caught off guard that often, and this trait is really good at helping with that. &nbsp;It gives +2 to Perception to avoid being surprised and to spot invisible or incorporeal creatures.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c15">Magic Traits</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c20 c16">Desperate Resolve:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; Sometimes, a Skald gets pinned down and needs to use a spell to get out of it. &nbsp;This gives a +1 bonus on Concentration checks; but it upgrades to +4 when grappled, pinned, entangled, or in violent weather. &nbsp;This can be useful for escapes or repositioning, especially when you can cast spells like Jester&rsquo;s Jaunt and Dimension Door.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c11">Air/Earth/Fire/Water-Touched:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; These traits are only really useful in resisting the attacks of elementals. &nbsp;DR/1 versus damage of those elementals isn&rsquo;t incredibly bad, but it isn&rsquo;t too great either.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c20 c16">Eldritch Delver:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; Some Skalds will go face off against ancient demons, ripping holes in space and time to do just that. &nbsp;This trait can fit that idea in two ways. &nbsp;First, this trait gives a +1 to Knowledge (History) and Knowledge (Planes) checks. &nbsp;In addition, you can treat your caster level as 1 higher when casting Conjuration spells of the Teleportation subschool. &nbsp;Other than the skill boost, this is more of a mid-late campaign trait.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c15">Social Traits</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c20 c16">Acrobat:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; Are you planning for your Skald to occasionally stage dive? &nbsp;Yes? &nbsp;Then we got to take a look at this trait. &nbsp;Acrobat gives a bonus to Acrobatics (and proficiency, which is kinda redundant), as well as reducing the penalty to Climb checks when climbing quickly. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s actually not too shabby.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c16 c20">Criminal:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; Lots of rock stars have gotten in trouble with the law at some point. &nbsp;Your Skald just gets to takes something away from it. &nbsp;Gaining the Disable Device or Sleight of Hand skills as a class skill is actually pretty sweet, and it bumps Intimidate.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8">Life of Toil:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; This is about the same as the Resilient combat trait, except you can take a different combat trait with this. &nbsp;And let&rsquo;s face it, this was the trait that men like James Brown and Bruce Springsteen had to have grown up with.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c27 c16">Talented:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; Be the greatest drummer, guitarist, or frontman that ever lived with this trait. &nbsp;It gives a +1 to a Perform skill of your choice and unlocks access to all the other Perform skills that Skalds don&rsquo;t have. &nbsp;So you could then take Perform (Comedy) along with Perform (Sing) and Perform (String) and effectively be Tenacious D. &nbsp;Rock on.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c15">Race Traits (Human)</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c16">Bekyar Slave Maestro:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; This is one of the two Skald specific Human traits currently available. &nbsp;And honestly, it&rsquo;s not exactly a great trait. &nbsp;A +2 to Diplomacy and Intimidate sounds great, except it only applies to people your Skald has held in captivity for 24 hours. &nbsp;I might see it working if the Skald in question was running an S&amp;M club, but otherwise you&rsquo;d be hard pressed to have a justification to take a slaver&rsquo;s trait.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c16">Shoanti Spirit-singer:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; This is the other Human trait that works for Skalds, and it is so good. &nbsp;You can get a free activation of Raging Song when caught off guard, effectively breaking through the Surprise Round to set up the battle. &nbsp;You&rsquo;d still be flat-footed, but that only lasts until you take a regular turn action.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c23 c36" id="h.a280ay4myr6l"><span class="c19 c13"></span></h1><h1 class="c23" id="h.ly1su89ng13l"><span class="c19 c13">Skalds and Feats -- Rocking Your World with More Style</span></h1><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c17 c13"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So you want to be even more of a rock star than you already are. &nbsp;This section assumes that you already know about common combat options like Power Attack and Weapon Focus. &nbsp;They&rsquo;re good choices for any character that might want to rock out, and you should feel free to take them. &nbsp;What we&rsquo;re going to focus on here are those lesser known options that shine for Skalds. &nbsp;We will also shine a light on the newly made options specifically for Skalds, as that can add a bit more flair to your inner rock star.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c15">Skald Feats</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8">Expanded Spell Kenning:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve already pointed out that Spell Kenning can be useful, but the limitations of only Bard, Cleric, or Sorc/Wis spells was a bit of a bummer. &nbsp;Advanced Class Origins included a feat tailor made to give you even greater options for Spell Kenning. &nbsp;This feat lets you rock the Druid and Witch spells too. &nbsp;So your Skald can make a sword of fire with Flame Blade. &nbsp;How metal is that?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c11">Improved Dirge of Doom:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; Dirge of Doom isn&rsquo;t exactly the best of the Raging Song options your Skald has available, but this feat does expand the area of effect for the Dirge. &nbsp;It also amplifies the effect to put up to a frightened effect in play. &nbsp;This feat has some use, so I can&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s completely terrible. &nbsp;But it comes in at level 11 at the earliest for the Skald. &nbsp;This is better off for the Bard, who gets Dirge of Doom two levels earlier.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c11">Greater Dirge of Doom:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; Frankly, this comes in too late to be in anyone&rsquo;s plans. &nbsp;You need Improved Dirge to take this feat, which makes it pretty bad for Skalds. &nbsp;It does a couple cool things though if you do take it. &nbsp;The Dirge&rsquo;s effect will linger for 2 extra rounds after they leave the area of effect, and it can produce a fear effect up to panicked.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c20 c16">Inspired by Fear:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; While the other Dirge of Doom required feats don&rsquo;t seem too great for a Skald, Inspired by Fear protects the party from fear effects. &nbsp;More precisely, the feat grants a +4 morale bonus to saves vs fear while you use Dirge of Doom. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8">Reckless Rage:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; This is a very metal feat for Skalds. &nbsp;It requires Power Attack, which is common enough that we won&rsquo;t worry about it. &nbsp;But while using Raging Song, you can take another -1 penalty to hit to gain an additional +2 damage to your Power Attack swings. &nbsp;As usual, this is modified further when wielding a two-handed weapon. &nbsp;This is excellent for smashing faces in and making a dragon into your own personal drum kit.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c20 c16">Recovered</span><span class="c3 c11">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c20 c16">Rage:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; This feat is a bit hard to judge, honestly. &nbsp;On the one hand, kicking ass means more Raging Song rounds while raging. &nbsp;On the other hand, you have to be raging to even use the feat. &nbsp;For every enemy that has &frac12; your Skald&rsquo;s Hit Dice or more that you bring to zero HP, you can get a round of Raging Song back. &nbsp;You have to be using Raging Song or some other source of rage to get the effect.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c20 c16">Battle Cry:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; This feat is very easy for a Skald to qualify for, and it gives a different morale bonus than the Raging Song. &nbsp;A +1 to attack rolls and a +4 to saves against fear for a minute is nothing to sneeze at, but the real value is the last part. &nbsp;If any ally under the effect of Battle Cry fails a saving throw, they can give up the bonuses to get a free reroll. &nbsp;And this feat can be used a number of times per day equal to the Skald&rsquo;s Charisma modifier.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8">Skald&rsquo;s Vigor:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; This feat is pretty much part of the core Skald experience, and for good reason. &nbsp;With your Inspired Raging Song, the Skald gains Fast Healing equal to the Strength bonus you receive from it. &nbsp;So as you level, you heal more. &nbsp;This allows for great sustainability in a fight, making it so you can soak up more damage. &nbsp;It does kick in the round after you start the song, and it ends the moment you stop performing. &nbsp;That means that the Bardic feats that extend the effects of your songs won&rsquo;t extend the duration of this feat&rsquo;s effect. &nbsp;And while this is a solid feat for any Thunderdome experience, it leads into &hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c16 c27">Greater Skald&rsquo;s Vigor:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; This feat is almost an early capstone for the Skald, being up as early as level 11 (10 if you retrain a feat). &nbsp;It not only speeds up when you start benefitting from Skald&rsquo;s Vigor, but it also immediately grants all allies that can hear your performance the Fast Healing that you&rsquo;d enjoy. &nbsp;So assume you go first and you fire up your Raging Song with this. &nbsp;Everyone else will start healing any damage they may take before they go in the turn order, so that can save your Clerics and other support characters valuable resources. &nbsp;So your party becomes true berserkers, and thus means you should queue the Manowar albums.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c11">Stouthearted:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; This feat gives a reroll versus fear effects, but you have to be maintaining a Raging Song to even use it. &nbsp;On top of that, it costs a round of your performance to use it. &nbsp;Battle Cry is substantially better.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c15">Religious Feats &amp;
