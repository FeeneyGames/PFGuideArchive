Goodbye to half of your choices of spell.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">Abjuration</span><span class="c1">: Protection spells, like Protection from Energy; Dispel Magic; Shield; etc</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">Conjuration</span><span class="c1">:Teleport; Summon Monster; Wall of Stone; Black Tentacles; Mage Armour; many others.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">Divination</span><span class="c1">: Scrying; Named Bullet; True Strike - probably the first choice of most players as an opposition school, but if you intend to use magic for scouting then lacking it hurts your ability to plan ahead and memorise the correct spells for the day. Goodbye, Shroedinger&rsquo;s Wizard, hello having the wrong spells...this is more of a problem at high level than low. If you aren&rsquo;t going to reach 6th level spells (True Seeing), then you probably won&rsquo;t miss this school as much.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">Enchantment</span><span class="c1">: Confusion; Charms, Dominate, etc. Also popular as an opposition school, confusion is the biggest loss.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">Evocation</span><span class="c1">: most blast spells, particularly the ones that can be fired through the gun. Since the Spellslinger is set up to be a blaster (more on that anon), it seems to be a school to keep - but is it really?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">Illusion</span><span class="c1">: All of the low-level &lsquo;don&rsquo;t hit me&rsquo; spells are in here (Mirror Image, Blur, Displacement); Invisibility and Greater. It really makes you very vulnerable at low level if you lose this school.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">Necromancy</span><span class="c1">: Enervation; Ray of Exhaustion; Waves of Fatigue; a few others. Enervation is probably the best individual spell to fire through your gun, but there aren&rsquo;t very many other spells here you&rsquo;d miss.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">Transmutation</span><span class="c1">: Fly; Overland Flight; Greater Magic Weapon; too many useful spells to list.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">So losing Divination, Enchantment, and Necromancy seem to be the most obvious ones, but the fourth choice will hurt - a lot. I&rsquo;m going to suggest losing Evocation, because as long as you have a few spells you fancy firing through your gun, and there are enough of these spells in conjuration and transmutation, you will be ok. If you could still get the &lsquo;Admixture&rsquo; subschool, then I might change my mind - but there are no school powers for you.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c16 c9 c7">Pistol or Musket?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Pistol. A musket does more damage and has a greater range, but unless you take 3 levels of Musket Master you will never be able to reload it faster than a move action. The Reloading Hands spell and a Beneficial Bandolier (uses your swift action to work) can reload one barrel once each per round for you, but you&rsquo;ll struggle to make a full attack worthwhile at higher levels. With a pistol, not only can you reload it as a free action when you desire (rapid reload + alchemical cartridges), but you can also hold a metamagic rod, or a staff, or a wand, or a potion, or a melee weapon in the other hand. This is good. A full caster build might not need the free action reloads, but is even more likely to want to be holding something more useful than just a gun. &nbsp;Being able to apply eg Dazing from a metamagic rod makes your blast spells better; coupled with a potential +5 to the DC of these compared to a normal wizard is pretty much a spellslinger&rsquo;s only way of being &lsquo;better&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c16 c9 c7">Roles and Builds</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Your choice of role to play affects your choice of schools too, so I&rsquo;m putting this section next.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">Cheesy but Legal: Witch, Cleric or Sorcerer</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">The very best sort of build to play is to not be a wizard. Take one level only of Spellslinger, then take either Sorcerer or Cleric or Witch. Then play as one of these who has a minor, yet nifty, ability with a gun. This is completely legal, because the Spellslinger archetype doesn&rsquo;t mention anything about having to use wizard spells only, or even arcane only, to fire through the gun or to sacrifice to enhance it. If you choose either of these (or any other class with spells) then you will only be losing one level to gain all of the benefits of the Spellslinger.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Read a guide to whatever class you choose; most of this guide will be redundant to you, however if you take feats to make your ranged weapon work better then you will have less feats to make your main role as effective as a non-spellslinger. For the Cleric, Harm with Reach is the only really potent, standout spell that might make it worth taking the level of spellslinger. Overall, though, you&rsquo;re probably better off simply taking the black powder inquisition if you really want to be a cleric with a gun.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">A sorcerer would be a level behind, but could take a few spells that work through the gun and otherwise be built in a similar way to a normal sorcerer.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">The witch actually matches up best. They get a goodly selection of spells, including Enervation, Lightning Bolt, Burning Hands, Cone of Cold and Harm (albeit at 7th level, 8th with Reach). Plus taking the &lsquo;Time&rsquo; patron gets you Disintegrate. A half-elf can take the Bonded Witch archetype, and so can make his/her gun into a bonded item and therefore can enchant it without needing to take the craft arms &amp; armour feat, along with most of the normal bonuses for having a bonded item. However, would using a gun appeal to a player who wanted to play a witch? If so, this is probably the most &lsquo;optimal&rsquo; version of the full-casting spellslinger.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">Party Wizard: Spellslinger all the Way</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">If you are the primary arcane caster in a party, then you will be weak compared to a normal wizard. If you intend to shoot your gun, then you&rsquo;re likely to want (some of) the ranged combat feats, and that will weaken you even more as a wizard because you can&rsquo;t get all the feats you&rsquo;re going to want. But if you&rsquo;re not going to fire your gun, why take this archetype? You trade all your school powers, an extra spell per spell level, your arcane bond, and 2 more opposition schools for being able to increase the DC of a few spells.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">Ranged Gish: Gunslinger1/Spellslinger5/Eldritch Knight10/Spellslinger4</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">You could take a different martial class, but gunslinger gets you grit (Quick Clear is always nice). The redundancy on feats (gunsmithing and firearms proficiency twice) is not quite total since you can choose either the Pistolero or Musket Master archetypes and your Spellslinger version of the Firearms feat will mean you still have proficiency in all firearms, including siege.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">This build looks like it&rsquo;s the one intended for you, but it does have significant drawbacks. First, you lose two levels from your casting class (the martial class level and the first level of Eldritch Knight), which makes you even weaker than a full wizard. When you finally get 4th level spells (Woot: Dimension Door, or Black Tentacles), he&rsquo;s just got Teleport and Overland Flight...and you have to pay for almost all of &nbsp;your spells, no free ones per level for a prestige class. You have fewer spells per day, of lower level, and from only 4 schools, remember. A stronger build for being a Wizard-with-a-gun, would be Gunslinger1/Normal Wizard5/Eldritch Knight10/etc.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">In addition, Eldritch Knight, while it increases your BAB nicely, swaps your wizard bonus feats for combat ones. This ensures that you can take most of the ranged combat feats, but also means that you won&rsquo;t have as many feats to improve your spell casting. Eg Metamagic feats; Spell Penetration; Summoning feats; etc. All of which weaken your wizardly power even further. And if you take Musket Master, you will never be able to reload as a free action - that needs the &lsquo;Fast Musket&rsquo; ability. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">You can&rsquo;t take advantage of the early entry to prestige classes rule by taking the divination school power, but you can qualify through a racial SLA that is a 3rd level arcane spell by being eg an Aasimar with Daylight. The only real advantage of this is getting the Eldritch Knight capstone ability at character level 12 instead of 16, but also delays your spellcasting progression so you only have 1st level spells until you reach character level 5. It&rsquo;s a toss-up whether it&rsquo;s worth doing in my opinion, so take whatever race appeals to you (Hint: Elf, best for a wizard). The capstone works really well in conjunction with the Named Bullet spell. It is otherwise hard to get many criticals with a gun.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">Ranged Striker: Gunslinger5/Spellslinger5/Eldritch Knight10</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Five levels of gunslinger get you the really important gunslinger bonus of getting to add your dex bonus to your damage with a gun (and Fast Musket at 3rd level, for a Musket Master).</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">This build is predominantly a gunslinger with some very useful spellcasting added on. It is not suitable as the main arcane caster in a party because you will be only just getting third level spells at level 10 when a full caster has been enjoying fifth level spells since level 9, however the way to look at this build is as a gunslinger who has some very tasty spellcasting added on. You end up with +17 BAB, and 7th level spells at 20th level. Compare that to most ranged specialists who are purely martial types. Since you aren&rsquo;t competing with a full wizard, most of the deficiencies of the archetype become irrelevant. All of your feat choices can be directed towards combat, yet you can still disintegrate your enemies!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">If you can persuade your GM that Trench Fighter (a fighter archetype) should be available to you, then this is even better than taking gunslinger levels. 3 levels of Trench Fighter gets you Dex to damage, and the lack of gunsmithing and exotic weapon proficiency (firearm) from Trench Fighter aren&rsquo;t a problem for you since Spellslinger has them - however, that should be an alarm call for the GM: Trench Fighter is specifically intended for campaigns with &lsquo;guns everywhere&rsquo; where advanced firearms are available and guns are no longer exotic.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Quite a few people suggest taking inquisitor levels once a gunslinger reaches level 5, but I think that Spellslinger and Eldritch Knight are far superior choices since EK adds to both BAB and arcane spellcasting, and Spellslinger can enhance your gun and the spells fired through it. A gunslinger/inquisitor will be better at switch-hitting, since most of the inquisitor class abilities work on melee as well as ranged (and it can wear better armour), but its spellcasting is a lot weaker.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Gunslinger5/Spellslinger5/EK10 is a bit of an indulgence as a character class. Your party should already have both a primary arcane caster and a front-line fighting type. Then there should be some sort of divine caster (cleric/oracle, inquisitor, paladin) for out of combat healing and status removal. You can then be a major damage-dealer and secondary mage. It&rsquo;s a lot better than being a rogue and you can take the &lsquo;Trap Finder&rsquo; trait if it&rsquo;s really needed - you&rsquo;ll have lots of skill points due to your high Intelligence. If you&rsquo;re the 5th member of a party, then this is an ideal build to play. Shoot everything whilst having Greater Invisibility up&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">For this build, the early entry Aasimar is possibly best so you get the capstone at L15 rather than 20, however you lose out on stats since you don&rsquo;t get any racial bonus to either Dex or Int. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">I have provided a fairly detailed guide to building one of these, at the end of this document.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">Alternative Ranged Striker: </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">Mysterious Stranger1/Spellslinger1/Sorcerer1/Eldritch Knight10/more sorcerer levels</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">This build gets to use grit points (Cha based) to add Cha to damage and then gets a better selection of spells from the Sorcerer class than a Spellslinger-based character. It won&rsquo;t be very effective until higher level (it gets 3rd level spells at character level 9), but if you start at high level it might be preferable to be able to cast spells from any school. Again, this really benefits from the early entry rule if you start at low level otherwise you can&rsquo;t take the EK class until you have 6 levels of sorcerer - which would mean having a low BAB for half your career, while also having delayed spell progression.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">Another Ranged Striker: </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">Spellslinger1/Inquisitor19 or Pistolero5/Spellslinger1/Inquisitor14</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">The Inquisitor19 version gets Harm, and can use a Rod of Reach to be able to use it through the gun. The version with 5 levels of gunslinger (or 3 of trench fighter, if allowed) will do more damage per shot normally. Both work in a similar manner: the inquisitor abilities increase fighting ability compared to a cleric, on a par with the Eldritch Knight levels, but with a different flavour. The spells are very limited in terms of having ones that benefit from being fired through the gun, but allow a character to act as either a backup arcane or divine spellcaster (or a very minor version of both), depending on the individual spells chosen. Overall, I think omitting the spellslinger level is more &lsquo;optimal&rsquo;, but if it appeals to you, you&rsquo;ll still be an effective ranged attacker with interesting abilities.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">Other Build that has been suggested:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Myrmidach Magus.

There are, of course, many spells that are often better than these to memorise, but are useful to most wizards - see a guide to Wizards for information about those.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">I have also listed the school for each spell, to help you decide which opposition schools to take.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">1st Level</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Snowball.

General spell rules seem to allow this, but the Spellslinger description calls out your ability to do so with only the 2 cantrips.

However, there are a lot of useful 4th level spells (Dimension Door, Emergency Force Sphere, Confusion - even at 2 slots, it&rsquo;s often worth having) competing for slots.

Yes seriously, it can still be better than these 7th level spells.

Conjuration.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Best: probably Greater Shout or Plane Shift, but you won&rsquo;t be taking any of these because of the other spells available (Maze, Irresistible Dance, Mind Blank, etc).</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">9th Level</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Energy Drain.

Necromancy.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Best: none, really. Would you take these? No, nor would I.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">And there you have it. How many of these &lsquo;special&rsquo; spells would a normal wizard bother memorising? Yet, to justify taking this archetype, a Spellslinger will have quite a lot of them. Necromancy gets more higher level spells that benefit from the higher DC from your gun, so is a prime candidate for the Opposition Research discovery.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Overall, you are likely to have: Snowball or Burning Hands/Colour Spray; Scorching Ray or Acid Arrow; Lightning Bolt or Pellet Blast; Enervation; and Disintegrate available to enhance with your gun. Adding Dazing with a metamagic rod (you did take a pistol, didn&rsquo;t you, so you can hold the rod at the same time as your gun?) will make most of those much better so you do more than just an increased chance of more damage from your higher DC than a normal wizard.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9 c7">Cleric Spells</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(for those taking Spellslinger1/Cleric X)</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ve only listed one Inflict Wounds spell, but there are lower level versions.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">1st</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;level: Ray of Sickening</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">2nd</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;level: Arrow of Law/Dread Bolt/Shard of Chaos/Spear of Purity; Blinding Ray (Dhampirs only); Admonishing Ray</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">3rd</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;level: Searing Light; Death Knell - with Reach</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">4th</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;level: Bestow Curse - with Reach; Contagion - with Reach.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">5th</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;level: Inflict Critical Wounds - with Reach. 4d8+1/lvl damage; Poison - with Reach.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">6th</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;level: Hellfire Ray; Cold Ice Strike; Plane Shift - with Reach.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">7th </span><span>level: Archon&rsquo;s Trumpet; </span><span class="c7">Harm - with Reach</span><span class="c1">. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">8th</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;level: Bestow Curse, Greater - with Reach.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Harm is better than any of the wizard spells, since it does so much damage even if the target saves and being able to get up to +5 on the DC might make it worth taking the level of spellslinger. Or it might not. Other notable spells are Plane Shift and Bestow Curse.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c16 c9 c7">Feats</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">There are many; you can only have a few of them. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">If you follow my suggested build (Gunslinger5/Spellslinger5/EK10) then you&rsquo;ll be taking mainly combat feats. You might want to take Craft Magic Arms &amp; Armour, unless magical guns are common or someone else is a crafter.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">Gun-related:</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Point-blank Shot.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Precise Shot.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Deadly Aim.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Rapid Reload.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Rapid Shot.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Improved Critical - since Keen doesn&rsquo;t apply to ranged weapons; but you can get Keen enchanted on your bullets (and then you should use the Abundant Ammunition spell on them).</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Focused Shot - but only if a) you&rsquo;re not going to be getting iterative attacks; b) you can persuade your GM to let this feat apply to firearms; and, if possible, c) if you can then persuade your GM that it applies to both bullets fired from a double-barreled gun.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Weapon Focus &amp; Snap Shot - if you can afford them. Followed by Improved Snap Shot &amp; Combat Reflexes.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">If you take levels in Eldritch Knight, you can also qualify for Weapon Specialisation &amp; Greater Weapon Focus, but I&rsquo;d be surprised if you had enough feats available to actually take them unless you neglect your wizard side completely.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Two weapon fighting, and improved versions might be interesting but again, you probably won&rsquo;t have enough feats. Without a 3rd arm, you&rsquo;d also then need quickdraw and a lot of spare guns.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Improved Initiative is always nice to have.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Improved Precise Shot isn&rsquo;t worth taking because the &lsquo;seeking&rsquo; property is better.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">Wizard-related:</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">See any guide to wizards. Look at the suggested feats and sigh. If you want to focus on spellcasting, then don&rsquo;t be a Spellslinger. You can take a selection of them, but you are unlikely to have enough of them to compete with a real wizard - unless you omit most of the combat ones listed above - and you still won&rsquo;t match even a basic blaster-type of wizard without the school power.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c16 c9 c7">Magic Gear</span></p><p class="c4"><span>There are two magic items that you probably want at low level: </span><span class="c6"><a class="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bandolier-beneficial&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117619321000&amp;usg=AOvVaw11NQShLH-XZ7r74fJzyFRU">Beneficial Bandolier</a></span><span>&nbsp;(belt slot) and </span><span class="c6"><a class="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bandolier-endless&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117619322000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2gHjPZGASN-ei_XcjSs2NE">Endless Bandolier</a></span><span>&nbsp;(chest slot)</span><span class="c1">. Once you can afford alchemical cartridges and have the Rapid Reload feat, you will have free action reloads (you did take a pistol not a musket?) so you can sell the Beneficial Bandolier and get a Belt of Incredible Dexterity. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Other gear you&rsquo;ll want: (apart from a magic gun) cloak of resistance, headband of Intellect, etc, etc. Like all characters.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7 c9">Example Build </span><span class="c7">Gunslinger5/Spellslinger5/Eldritch Knight10</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">Race</span><span class="c1">: You could pick Aasimar to get early entry to Eldritch Knight, but that loses you any racial bonus to either Dex or Int. I prefer Tiefling, so you can get a prehensile tail. This enables you to pull off either the ultra-cheesy two weapon fighting build with a humungous amount of free actions (subject to GM approval), with or without double-barrel pistols, or it allows you to be able to hold and retrieve items from your handy haversack/efficient quiver - potions, scrolls, rods, wands, etc. Plus tieflings can have claws (or a bite) so they count as armed without you needing to switch weapons if someone gets too close to you.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">Stats</span><span class="c1">: You will want an Int of 18 by level 20 (and the higher it is, the better your spell DCs will be). Otherwise, have Dex as high as possible, plus some Con. I don&rsquo;t like having a penalty in Wis (for saves, but to get more than one point of grit you&rsquo;ll need a score of 14). You could drop charisma further, and assume that you will use a magic item to boost your Int later on, to get higher Con or any particular arrangement you prefer.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">20pt buy:</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Str 8</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Dex 17 +2 Race</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Con 12</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Int 15 +2 Race</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Wis 10</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Cha 10 -2 Race</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Level ups will go into Dex &amp; Int. 4th: Dex, to 20; 8th: Int, to 18. Then I&rsquo;d favour Int at 12th and 16th level because one more point of damage is not as useful as one more point to your spell DCs.

If you have a Rod of Dazing, then Colour Spray and Pellet Blast might be useful fired through your gun.
