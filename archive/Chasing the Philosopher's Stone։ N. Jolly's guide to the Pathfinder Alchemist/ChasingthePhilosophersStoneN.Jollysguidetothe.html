There are of course three main roles of which can be filled, and this guide will focus primarily on those. While you can attempt to do other things with this class (and I encourage you to experiment with different combinations), the following are the ones that the class is most tailored to complete.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c18 c19 c15">Generalist Alchemist</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4">Pros</span><span class="c3">: The job of a generalist Alchemist is to be able to do everything the class has to offer; from laying down covering fire with your Bombs to being able to down a Mutagen and mix things up in melee as well as anyone else. Flexibility is the name of the game for this role, and because of it you should be ready to handle any situation that comes your way. Adding Extracts to your list of abilities only widens the scope of which you can handle, making you one of the most versatile characters in the game. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4">Cons</span><span class="c3">: For everything it can do, it can&#39;t do anything perfectly. Specializing is almost always better in 3.P, and lacking that specialization you might feel a bit overshadowed in some parts. &nbsp;For this role, it&rsquo;s essential that you cover your weaknesses thoroughly.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4">Suggested Archetypes</span><span class="c3">: Clone Master, Preservationist</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4 c25 c19"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c18 c19 c15">Mad Bomber (MB)</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4">Pros</span><span class="c5">: Alchemist are given many different ways to enhance their bombs, and this gives them a wide range of battlefield control. From Frost Bombs staggering to Grease Bombs setting up difficult terrain, your ability to hinder and debuff are hard to beat. You are also very capable of putting out large amounts of burst damage, especially after level 8 (Fast Bombs), ending encounters in a hail of shrapnel and chemicals that leave the battlefield tailored to your choosing. &nbsp;Consider picking up a bow as well since you&rsquo;re specializing in ranged combat. &nbsp;For more detailed information on playing a Mad Bomber, </span><span>check out </span><span class="c14 c23"><a class="c17" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://zenithgames.blogspot.com/2015/11/zeniths-guide-to-alchemist-part-i.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117267816000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0fGqTqSOfZdKSOyqssY76N">Zenith&rsquo;s Guide to the Alchemist</a></span><span>.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4">Cons</span><span class="c5">: Bombs are a finite resource, and once you&#39;re out, you&#39;ve lost a lot of versatility. In the 15 min</span><span>ute</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;adventuring day, this isn&#39;t that awful. But in the early levels as well as later levels if you build around nova bombing, you can easily run out in only a few rounds. And the mutagen is less useful for you,</span><span>&nbsp;but only slightly.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4">Suggested Archetypes</span><span class="c3">: Grenadier, Mind Chemist</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c15">Master Hyde</span><span class="c18 c19 c15">&nbsp;(MH)</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4">Pros</span><span class="c5">: This is going to be the more damage focused Alchemist, as generally you&rsquo;ll be wanting to take Vivisectionist with this. &nbsp;While you can play an </span><span>Master Hyde</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;build without taking that archetype, you&rsquo;re still a heavily damage focused character. &nbsp;Your strengths are generally more endurance than your fellow Mad Bombers, although you pay for this with less battlefield control, which can be very important to a lot of players. &nbsp;</span><span>Master Hyde</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;players are very versatile though, being able to tangle in melee with using bombs as a secondary source of damage, making them quite useful.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4">Cons</span><span class="c3">: Taking vivisectionist limits your attack options quite a bit, and without it you&rsquo;re leaving damage on the table. unless you have a certain bomb you can&rsquo;t live without. &nbsp;Also you&rsquo;ll be in more risk of taking damage, as well as far more selfish with your use of extracts. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s always more dangerous on the front lines, so be careful.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4">Suggested Archetypes</span><span class="c3">: Vivisectionist, Beastmorph</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><a id="kix.tsnmelcla1jd"></a><p class="c9"><span class="c18 c14">Sub Roles</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3">While the main roles are obvious, the sub roles of the class are a bit more subtle, taking up the background of your character&#39;s abilities. &nbsp;Some sub rolls will affect your combat style, while others will affect how you interact with the campaign setting itself. &nbsp;When deciding on a sub role, it&rsquo;s always best to confer with your party to help figure out what the party needs before deciding on which is best for you, as giving your group a wide array of different skills is one of your most important roles as an Alchemist. &nbsp;These are going unrated as each of them is as viable as the others, so feel free to take whichever suits your character best.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c18 c19 c15"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c18 c19 c15">Rogue Substitute</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4">Pros</span><span class="c5">: Aside from Trapfinding (which certain archetypes/traits give), you can make a perfectly viable Rogue with a few traits. You almost have as many skill points as a Rogue, can pick up Sneak Attack if you want, and the Alchemist&rsquo;s Extracts and Mutagens make most of the traditional Rogue jobs (Scouting, Sneaking, Etc,) much easier for you. This is also probably the least intensive Sub Role you can have, making it easy to focus on a second one as well. And for added fun, </span><span class="c4 c23"><a class="c17" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.d20pfsrd.com/traits/campaign-traits/mummy-s-mask/trap-finder&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117267819000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1P3V1vadVLwqHTQZM-zN-a">here&#39;s the Rogue&#39;s only niche it had left in a trait</a></span><span class="c18 c19 c15">.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4">Cons</span><span class="c3">: This basically requires you to burn your traits on skill traits to tailor yourself to whatever type of Rogue you want to emulate. There&#39;s a good chance you&#39;ll need to take Additional Traits as well, and this will eat into the skill points you need to do your job as an Alchemist. Please don&#39;t do this role with a Rogue in your party.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4">Suggested Archetype</span><span class="c3">: Trap Breaker</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c18 c19 c15">Buffer</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4">Pros</span><span class="c3">: Probably the biggest advantage you have in buffing is the ability to buff without using your own actions. Being able to hand out your buffs (literally) allows you to use your own actions to others can give you a much better chance to get more off. You have a pretty decent list of buffs as well, so make sure to share them. &nbsp;And remember that you have a lot of buffs that only you can give out, like Monstrous Physique which is generally only for the caster. &nbsp;Try giving that to your beatstick and watch him go crazy on others.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4">Cons</span><span class="c5">: You have two major issues: Unable to multitarget buff and your one advantage, having your party buff itself. Some extracts lack value, being only single target instead of effecting the full number they normally would. And every buff you give your party is one you&#39;re not using for yourself, </span><span>making</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;you individually weaker.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4">Suggested Archetype</span><span class="c5">: Chirurgeon</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4 c25 c19"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c18 c19 c15">Scary Hyde</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4">Pros</span><span class="c3">: It&#39;s not hard at all for you to get scary fast, especially considering all the things you get to boost it. This is especially good for Hyde, whom with Shatter Defenses can get Sneak Attack off on a shaken opponent, which is mostly useful for Vivisectionist.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4">Cons</span><span class="c3">: Immunity to fear isn&#39;t uncommon, nor are save bonuses against it. Shaken itself isn&#39;t the best debuff you can stick, and this style tends to use its swift actions quite readily.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4">Suggested Archetype</span><span class="c3">: Beastmorph</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c18 c19 c15">Debuff Bomber</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4">Pros</span><span class="c5">: A specialty of bombers (especially Grenadiers) this route mostly entails using other alchemical items to add to your bombs, as well as using different discoveries to augment your hindering capabilities. There&#39;s a few items that work wonders for this, and investing a little coin in some alchemical items could make a huge difference in battles. These can also help keep you useful even once you run out of bombs</span><span>.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4">Cons</span><span class="c3">: You&#39;ll be burning through consumables much quicker than a standard Alchemist, which could burn a hole in your pocket.

You have a character who has very easy access to Enlarge Person, as well as proficiency with a reach weapon (longspear) which gives you a 20 foot radius of death. With Mutagens as well as other buffs, you&#39;ll be outpacing equal level melee without fail, being able to lock down the field like none other.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c18 c19 c15"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4">Cons</span><span class="c3">: This build while solid will probably lack the damage of Brutal Hyde. That&#39;s not exactly a problem, but you won&#39;t be at peak damage, your moderate BAB will slow your iterative progression, and you&#39;ll be investing more into yourself (instead of your party) with your buffs.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4">Suggested Archetypes</span><span class="c3">: Beastmorph</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c18 c19 c15">Poisoner</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4">Pros</span><span class="c5">: You are the undisputed master of poison, and can use them better than anyone else.

It&#39;s true that you don&#39;t have the best spell list, but you do have quite a few gems on your list which come from both the arcane and divine list. And the ability to steal spells off of a wizard&rsquo;s spellbook is golden. You don&#39;t get a lot of extracts per level, and the lack of sharing (without taking the &ldquo;Infusion&quot; discovery) hurts a bit, but this is still a rather large part of the class which helps make it attractive. Also, nothing trades out for it, so you&rsquo;re stuck with great modified casting</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c10">Bomb </span><span class="c1">(****)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;(</span><span class="c4 c21">MB </span><span class="c15 c21">(*****)</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c4 c6">MH </span><span class="c2">(***)</span><span class="c3">) This is the centerpiece of the bomber due to all the different discoveries and such, and even Hyde should take one or two discoveries to add to their arsenal. Your bomb damage starts off pretty nice, but the more you invest in it (Fast Bombs, Sticky Bombs), the more it pays off. Bombs can also carry very nice debuffing abilities, making them quite adaptable to whatever situation you&#39;re in. And for Hyde, there&#39;s a few types of bombs that can make your job a lot easier.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c6">Brew potion </span><span class="c2">(***)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;(</span><span class="c0">MB </span><span class="c12">(**)</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c4 c6">MH </span><span class="c2">(***)</span><span class="c3">) This is less valuable for a bomber since they don&rsquo;t need to be buffed as much. Potions are the most expensive and restrictive type of consumable magic item, you do have exclusive access to some potions that aren&#39;t normally possible. Honestly I&rsquo;d only go as high as 1st level potions, but the options are there so that you can stretch your buffing talent. Note that you wouldn&rsquo;t normally qualify for this, just in case you want to trade it away for an ability from an archetype.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c10">Mutagen</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">(****) </span><span class="c5">(</span><span class="c4 c6">MB </span><span class="c2">(***)</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c4 c21">MH </span><span class="c15 c21">(*****)</span><span class="c5">) Your bomber won&#39;t get nearly the value out of this that Hyde will, but it&#39;s still a very solid addition to their ability roster.

While there is a discovery to change that (Infusion), this is a specific feature of the class, and the designers stated that this was intentional to make them a &quot;selfish buffer.&quot;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5 c20 c19 c16"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5 c20 c19 c16">Extracts are still inherently magical, and can be dispelled like any other magical effect. There are some odd issues with extracts, as they lose all magical ability when out of your grasp (unless they&#39;re an Infusion.) Something to note is that infusions stay active once used, so try and make sure that you don&#39;t get them stolen, or you could be out of a slot for good! This is also notable because it allows you to leave an infusion with a party member until they need it, so you don&#39;t have to continue to reprepare one.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5 c20 c19 c16"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5 c20 c19 c16">One of the best things about extracts though is how quickly they can be prepared; it only takes 1 minute to prepare an extract, which means while you won&#39;t be swapping them out in combat, this does give you a high level of versatility. For this reason, you should avoid preparing all your extract at the beginning of the day. </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5 c20 c19 c16">Make sure you only prepare the ones you know you&#39;ll be using (such as Enlarge Person for Hyde), since one of your biggest advantages is your formulae book.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5 c20 c19 c16"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5 c20 c19 c16"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5 c16">Speaking of your formulae book, you have the same ease as a Wizard to add extracts to your list. While they have to be on your class list, this is a good way of buffing your own extract knowledge, and each one directly adds to your versatility.And on another note, the rules are quite irritating about Communal extracts though. From the rules on Communal Extracts:</span><span class="c4 c16">&nbsp;&ldquo;Dispensing communal formulae to creatures requires that the alchemist have the infusion discovery. Without it, the alchemist cannot use communal spells as formulae.&rdquo;</span><span class="c5 c20 c19 c16">&nbsp; So all Communal Extracts will be rated under the assumption you have the Infusion Discovery. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5 c20 c19 c16"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5 c20 c19 c16">The only thing I could find relating to how to share them would be the Elixir of Shadewalking, which states the additional recipients must be touching you at the time of consumption. Most communal extracts aren&#39;t 1 round per level spells, so this shouldn&#39;t be an issue though.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5 c20 c19 c16"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c19 c30 c16 c36">Alternative Forms</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5 c20 c19 c16">Now for your Hyde types, you&rsquo;re going to be changing into some stranger and wild forms. &nbsp;But picking out which is the best for you is often quite a challenge. &nbsp;I can&rsquo;t pretend to know every situation you&rsquo;ll get yourselves into, but if you&rsquo;re looking for polymorph advice, I suggest you check here</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5 c20 c19 c16"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c14 c24 c23"><a class="c17" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1avbOKg848X3Z3dVpmdrpxtR__zan2jj_NzP0uZU9LTw/edit&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117268039000&amp;usg=AOvVaw21s27kV6CKtdRYVFqy3VA_">Polymorphamory - The Love of Changing Form</a></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5 c20 c19 c16"></span></p><a id="kix.p0wpwbpb8zjd"></a><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c20 c19 c16">1st Level Extracts</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c6">Adhesive Spittle </span><span class="c2">(***)</span><span class="c4 c16">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c16">(</span><span class="c4 c6">MB </span><span class="c2">(***)</span><span class="c5 c16">/</span><span class="c4 c6">MH </span><span class="c2">(***)</span><span class="c5 c20 c19 c16">) I like tanglefoot bags, and at early levels, this can save you some cash on them. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s not great, since it&rsquo;s two rounds to use one with its short duration, but tanglefoot bags are nice.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Abjuring Step </span><span class="c12">(**)</span><span class="c5 c16">&nbsp;(</span><span class="c4 c11">MB</span><span class="c11 c15">&nbsp;(*)</span><span class="c5 c16">/</span><span class="c4 c11">MH</span><span class="c11 c15">&nbsp;(*)</span><span class="c5 c20 c19 c16">) While your baseliner can use this time to hand out buffs, the more proactive Alchemist aren&#39;t going to waste a turn not destroying something.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c11">Ant Haul</span><span class="c11 c15">&nbsp;(*)</span><span class="c5 c16">&nbsp;(</span><span class="c4 c11">MB</span><span class="c11 c15">&nbsp;(*)</span><span class="c5 c16">/</span><span class="c4 c11">MH</span><span class="c11 c15">&nbsp;(*)</span><span class="c5 c20 c19 c16">) This is an extract that would get better with time, if eventually you weren&#39;t picking up a Handy Haversack.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c6">Anticipate Peril </span><span class="c2">(***)</span><span class="c5 c16">&nbsp;(</span><span class="c4 c6">MB </span><span class="c2">(***)</span><span class="c5 c16">/</span><span class="c4 c6">MH </span><span class="c2">(***)</span><span class="c5 c20 c19 c16">) While the duration isn&#39;t great, if you know you&#39;re going into a situation where you need to act first, a +5 to initiative is going to make sure you do.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Blend </span><span class="c12">(**) </span><span class="c5 c16">(</span><span class="c0">MB </span><span class="c12">(**)</span><span class="c5 c16">/</span><span class="c0">MH </span><span class="c12">(**)</span><span class="c5 c16">) This is a poor man&#39;s Vanish, and it</span><span class="c16">&nbsp;is </span><span class="c5 c20 c19 c16">elf only.

The issue with this is that they still lose something (Bomb damage, progression, etc) before giving you anything in return. So if an archetype would remove something before giving you a benefit (such as the </span><span class="c4">Level Requirement</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;of Clone Master which is 7th) it will have a </span><span class="c4">Level Requirement</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;in which you are first compensated for this loss.

I&#39;ll be skipping over classes that have nothing to offer you, unless there&#39;s a need to warn you to stay away. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c25 c19">Core</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c6">Fighter</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">(***) </span><span class="c5">(</span><span class="c0">MB </span><span class="c12">(**)</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c4 c6">MH </span><span class="c2">(***)</span><span class="c5">) Probably the most dip friendly class in the game, this is where you get your heavy armor, all martial weapons, and all that good stuff. But two archetypes I want to point out specifically are: </span><span class="c4 c10">Unbreakable</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(****)</span><span class="c5">, who trades away their first level feat for BOTH Endurance and Diehard. You know how much those feats got mentioned in the guide, and for you to get them both this easily is chocolate. The other is a new one, </span><span class="c4 c6">Trench Fighter </span><span class="c2">(***)</span><span class="c3">. While you&#39;ll have to burn a feat on gun proficiency (I&#39;m certain this archetype is meant for a game where guns are a martial weapon) you get dex to damage on your firearm at 3rd level. That&#39;s 2 levels earlier than the Gunslinger, basically making that class obsolete for dipping in anything but a Guns Everywhere campaign.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c6">Monk </span><span class="c2">(***)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;(</span><span class="c0">MB </span><span class="c12">(**)</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c4 c6">MH</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">(***)</span><span class="c5">) Much like the fighter, you&#39;re here for two levels of feats. The difference being instead of armor and weapons, you&#39;re grabbing Improved Unarmed Strike, a +3 to all your saves, and a few other goodies. Probably the best package here (if your GM doesn&#39;t hate archetype stacking) is </span><span class="c4 c10">Sohei/Master of Many Styles </span><span class="c1">(****)</span><span class="c5">. For two levels, this gives you 2 style feats that you don&#39;t have to meet prerequisites for (Snake Style), always acting in the surprise round and a +1</span><span class="c11 c15">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">to initiative. That&#39;s one hell of a dip.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Ranger</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">(**) </span><span class="c5">(</span><span class="c4 c11">MB (*)</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c0">MH </span><span class="c12">(**)</span><span class="c5">) This is a lesser dip than the Fighter but there&#39;s still a few unique things you get. If you&#39;re going to dip, do it for two levels and go the natural attack style to pick up Aspect of the Beast, which has a nice suite of abilities that you can take. And I&#39;d go </span><span class="c4 c6">Freebooter </span><span class="c2">(***)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;to get Freebooter&#39;s Bane, which is way less situational than Favored Enemy. Since it&#39;s a move action to use and never runs out, you can spend the first round buffing while you give a Bard like boost against a single enemy, as well as never having to worry about running out. Also it&#39;s not worth staying here to get Endurance, as the opportunity cost is too high.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c11">Wizard (*)</span><span class="c5">(</span><span class="c0">MB </span><span class="c12">(**)</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c4 c11">MH (*)</span><span class="c5">) Slightly better than the Sorcerer for a few reasons, including intelligence synergy. Your familiar won&#39;t level up, but the bonuses it gives you (+4 to initiative) are always great, which can be added to a divination specialist wizard to allow you to always act in the surprise round. If the familiar bonus doesn&#39;t matter to you, you could go </span><span class="c4 c6">Arcane Bomber </span><span class="c2">(***)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;to get a more flexible bomb damage type, although losing Cantrips with that hurts. Still, it stacks for bomb damage, so you&#39;re at least not losing any</span><span class="c11 c15">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">progression which is nice.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4 c25 c19"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c25 c19">Non Core</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c11">Gunslinger (*)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;(</span><span class="c4 c11">MB (*)</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c4 c11">MH (*)</span><span class="c5">) Thanks to the </span><span class="c4 c6">Trench Fighte</span><span class="c2">r (***)</span><span class="c5">, the Gunslinger lost its only niche in dex to damage with firearms. This does however become </span><span class="c4 c10">BLUE </span><span class="c1">(****)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;if the campaign is being played with the Guns Everywhere rules, as they pick up Gun Training at first level instead of fifth.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Investigator </span><span class="c12">(**)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;(</span><span class="c0">MB </span><span class="c12">(**)</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c0">MH </span><span class="c12">(**)</span><span class="c3">) While I want to like this more, Investigators only really kick off at 4th level, which to me is too much for a dip. &nbsp;Before that, you&rsquo;re not getting a lot, although getting Inspiration can be pretty nice. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re willing to dip for 4 levels, it&rsquo;s not a bad idea for Hyde, although your Discovery choices should be based around damage. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s not terrible just for feats to pick up extra inspiration though.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Magus</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">(**) </span><span class="c5">(</span><span class="c4 c11">MB (*)</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c0">MH </span><span class="c12">(**)</span><span class="c3">) You&#39;re here to pick up Spellstrike, that&#39;s it. The casting is nice, this version of Arcane Strike is pretty nice, and Shocking Grasp is pretty decent (Might want to pick up Magical Knack to let it and your other spells increase in damage a bit.) I&#39;d probably consider this the best caster dip for your melee character, and gives you a little more variety.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Summoner </span><span class="c12">(**)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;(</span><span class="c4 c11">MB (*)</span><span class="c5">/</span><span class="c4 c6">MH </span><span class="c2">(***)</span><span class="c5">) Jumping straight into the </span><span class="c4 c10">Synthesis </span><span class="c1">(****)</span><span class="c3">, this gives you pounce at level 1 with three natural attacks. You never stop having pounce, as well as a slight buffer of HP to play with. The summons are never great for you, and the spells aren&#39;t either, but both are useful enough. Also pounce at first level. I&#39;m not sure how this works when you transform using extracts, but I&#39;m pretty sure you lose out on what your original form had, so that&#39;s a bit sad.

Sure you&#39;re taking a -4 non proficiency penalty, but it&#39;s a touch attack so that&#39;s not really a huge deal.

First of all, they require Rapid Reload to function after a point, which comes a lot sooner if you took Rapid Shot. They also don&#39;t improve your range from what you can manage with bombs, and unlike bombs, they become worse than crossbows outside of their first range increment. They&#39;re also very costly both in cost and for their ammunition, and require you to have gunsmithing to fix them up in case of misfire.

While Alchemist are easily the masters of poison, that doesn&#39;t make them a great item. &nbsp;But it does give you the unique possibility of making them viable. &nbsp;The problem with poisons is that it&#39;s quite hard to increase their DCs without raising their price to a point where they lose value. As an alchemist, you have a few options which increase their power in your discoveries.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">But one rarely used rule is that you can add additional doses of a poison if </span><span>its</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;manner of delivery is either ingested or inhaled. While ingested isn&#39;t a big deal, inhaled is what we&#39;re looking at here. The best way to make an inhaled poison is to take a non inhaled poison, and change it with the Poison Conversion discovery. Without that, you&#39;ll generally outgrow poisoning by about level 6 or so. If you&#39;re going to go down the conversion route, your poisons need to follow a few simple rules.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c18 c19 c15"></span></p><ul class="c29 lst-kix_q8e8xq8xg4i-0 start"><li class="c9 c27 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4">Low cost</span><span class="c3">: The cheaper you can get this poison, the better since you&#39;ll be paying for it a lot. &nbsp;Crafting it yourself helps, but you have to consider your bottom line.</span></li><li class="c9 c27 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4">No onset time</span><span class="c3">: If you&#39;re planning on using this in combat, you can&#39;t wait for it to take effect. &nbsp;Even the small damage of these is more helpful per round.</span></li><li class="c9 c27 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4">Solid Initial/Secondary Effect</span><span class="c3">: Some poisons will have a great initial effect, but you only get that once, and then the secondary effect, which might be a lot more lackluster. Make sure your poison is always doing something good before picking it up.</span></li><li class="c9 c27 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4">Per Round Frequency</span><span class="c3">: Most of the time you&#39;ll be using these in combat, and especially with inhaled poisons, your target is going to know they were poisoned by something around them. You can&#39;t have 1/min effects on them, because that&#39;s just too slow to be used in battle, since it&rsquo;s generally over before 10 rounds.</span></li></ul><p class="c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3">Beyond that, any poison is fair game (a favorite of mine is Drow Poison for how cheap it is, and its effects of knocking out people instantly) although some are better suited to be changed and altered if you&rsquo;re looking for stat damage instead.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3">Let me give a few of my favorite examples below. Note the cost of these is being viewed at Level 6, the point in which you can take Poison Conversion, which is what makes these poisons relevant. &nbsp;The lacking onset time is what makes them combat viable.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c18 c19 c15">Black Adder Venom</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c18 c19 c15">120 GP, DC 11, 1/round for 6 rounds, 1d2 Con damage</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3">This is the most cost efficient constitution damage you can buy, with the step up to 1d3 increasing by nearly 4x the cost. Stacking doses of this is the best way to kill a low con creature in no time flat.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c18 c19 c15">Bloodroot</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c18 c19 c15">100 GP, DC 12, 1/round for 4 rounds, 1 Con and 1 Wis damage</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3">A surefire Cleric killer, stacking this up will make up for the lacking duration as well as making the target vulnerable for both fortitude and will save failure. This is also the fastest mental stat damaging poison, as the rest are all 1/min frequency, which really is a shame. Sadly it does have a one round delay, but one round isn&#39;t terrible for something this nasty.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c18 c19 c15">Drow Poison</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c18 c19 c15">75 GP, DC 13, 1/minute for 2 minutes, Unconscious for 1 minute/Unconscious for 2d4 hours</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3">And the knockout blow. No onset, instant sleep, and the chance to put them out for hours is just too good. This is probably the bread and butter of your poisoning set, making it easy to knock out anything that breathes.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c18 c19 c15">Medium Spider Venom</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c18 c15 c19">150 GP, DC 14, 1/round for 4 rounds, 1d2 Str damage</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3">The cheapest strength damage we can get, this loves the duration stacking from adding multiple doses, and has a good chance of knocking out brutes if you can get it early and stay away from them.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3">While you can go more expensive to get more ability damage at once, the cost ratio really begins to eat into your effectiveness. For most of these, a hit and run style of play is recommended as to force your opponent to suffer through these effects at length</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3">Poisons like this are worthless against opponents who don&#39;t breath, so undead and such (assuming you took Celestial Poisons) are immune to them. Also be aware of spells that can block air flow, like Wind Wall and Fickle Winds. For opponents like that, your best bet is Sticky Poisons, since it&#39;ll help spread your poison budget. It&#39;s not great since you don&#39;t get a lot of attacks with the same weapon (so you&#39;ll be waiting longer to deliver multiple doses, as well as being in melee), but undead often have lower fort saves, which makes up for the lack of inhaled abuse.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3">You are still capable of making poisons a viable tool using this advice, but realize that it&#39;ll be a straight drain on your gold for a consumable bonus, so make sure you&#39;re aware of everything that goes into using this tactic, and happy poisoning.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c18 c14"></span></p><a id="kix.pwownjrp0dpc"></a><p class="c9"><span class="c18 c14">Hybridization Funnel and you: A primer</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3">With alchemical items being your style, this item is an incredible way to increase your versatility and damage.

By about level 4-5, you should be able to make this while taking 10, so that&#39;s about the point this will become a viable tool for you.

This is a very specialized build though, so if you&#39;re not comfortable with this many dump stats, you could easily lower the dex and int on this build, but it takes away what makes it an insane, weak, ugly goblin.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c18 c14"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c18 c14"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c18 c14"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c18 c14"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c18 c14"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c18 c14"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c18 c14"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c18 c14"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c18 c14"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c18 c14"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c18 c14"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c18 c14"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c18 c14"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c18 c14"></span></p><a id="id.mpat6nx3cywq"></a><p class="c9"><span class="c14">Master Hyde</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c18 c19 c15">Harrison Zahhak</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3">Male Ragebred (Skinwalker) Beastmorph/Vivisectionist 5 </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3">NE Medium humanoid (Shapeshifter)</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4">Init</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;+2; </span><span class="c4">Senses</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Perception +10</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4">AC</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;16, touch 12, flat-footed 14 (+4 armor, +2 Dex)</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4">HP</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;42 (5d8+20)</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4">Fort</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;+8, </span><span class="c4">Ref</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;+7, </span><span class="c4">Will</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;+5</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4">Speed</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;30 ft.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4">Melee</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Gore +6 (1d6+8) or Gore +6 (1d6+6), Bite +6 (1d8+6), 2 Claws +6 (1d6+6) 2 Hooves +1 (1d4+3)</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4">Ranged </span><span class="c3">+1 Adaptive Composite Longbow +7 (1d8+5)</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4">Special Attacks</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Sneak Attack +3d6, mutagen (+4 Str, &ndash;2 Int, +2 natural armor, 50 minutes)</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4">Alchemist Extracts Prepared</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(CL 5nd)</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4">1st</span><span class="c3">-Enlarge Person x2, Cure Light Wounds, True Strike, Anticipate Peril</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4">2nd</span><span class="c3">-Invisibility, Bull&#39;s Strength</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4">Str </span><span class="c5">18, </span><span class="c4">Dex</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;14, </span><span class="c4">Con</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;16, </span><span class="c4">Int</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;14, </span><span class="c4">Wis</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;12, </span><span class="c4">Cha</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;5</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4">Base Atk</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;+3; </span><span class="c4">CMB</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;+7; </span><span class="c4">CMD</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;19</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4">Feats</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Extra Feature, Power Attack, Arcane Strike</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4">Traits</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Hunter&rsquo;s Eye, Tiger&#39;s Claw, Second Chance</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4">Drawback</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Xenophobic</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4">Favored Class Bonus</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;HP</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4">Skills</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Craft (Alchemy) +15, Disable Device +10, Knowledge (Arcana) +10, Knowledge (Nature) +10, Perception +10, Spellcraft +10</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4">Discoveries</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Feral Mutagen, Infusion</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4">Gear</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Mwk Chain Shirt, Belt of Giant&#39;s Strength +2 , Cloak of Resistance +1, Hybridization Funnel, +1 Adaptive Composite Longbow 600 GP</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c18 c19 c15">Design Notes</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3">Harrison here is armed with 4 primary physical attacks and 2 secondary, which is just ugly. The guy lacks any flaws, and even comes with an SLA to power their Arcane Strike, which is using a swift action you don&#39;t need elsewhere. The level of hurt this character can put down is supernatural, although thanks to their stellar natural attack routine, he&#39;s unable to get much out of transformation based extracts.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3">With all of these attacks putting out so much damage, picking up an AOMF is basically the next thing on your shopping list as you&#39;re doing 4(1d4+6 +3d6) without even getting lucky with the hooves if you can get them all to land, which is a blender. Consider Hammer the Gap when you qualify to make sure all your other natural attacks hit as well. I doubt I&#39;d use this build in an actual game, but once it gets pounce...game over. &nbsp;Probably your first purchase is going to be a Potion of Magic Fang +5, but it&rsquo;s not listed here due to availability issues.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c14 c28 c23"><a class="c17" href="#kix.rumq7lggbx7n">Return to Table of Content</a></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p><a id="kix.ys5g41jv6pk3"></a><p class="c9"><span class="c7 c4">12.
