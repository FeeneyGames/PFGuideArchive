c15">Introduction</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">Of all the new classes introduced in Occult Adventures, the Psychic is perhaps the simplest to understand. &nbsp;It is essentially an Int-based sorcerer with a slightly different spell list. &nbsp;If you know how to make a solid sorcerer, you can make similar choices with a psychic and emerge a perfectly functional Tier 2 caster.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">However, there are enough differences and nuances to psychic magic that a more in-depth look will certainly be beneficial. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9 c11"></span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c24 c1"><a class="c13" href="#id.okfvl7saoszr">Race Selection</a></span></p><p

c19">Blue: </span><span class="c4 c1">Excellent. &nbsp;A great choice. &nbsp;Much better than nearly any other option.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Green:</span><span class="c6 c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Good. &nbsp;A solid choice. &nbsp;Perhaps not the best, but these will serve admirably.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Black: </span><span class="c4 c1">Average. &nbsp;Functional. &nbsp;A good baseline measurement.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c30">Orange: </span><span class="c4 c1">Sub-par or situational. &nbsp;Not actively harmful,

class="c29"><span class="c4 c28">~ancient aphorism</span></p><p class="c23 c29"><span class="c4 c28"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">A Psychic can fill in for a primary arcane caster; it&rsquo;s closest cousins are the wizard, sorcerer, and arcanist. &nbsp;That said, there are certain roles its class features and spell list make it gravitate towards.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c19 c21">Information Retrieval: </span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;Much like the wizard, a psychic is a huge nerd. &nbsp;With Int-based casting, all Knowledge skills, and access to several unique divinations and occult skill unlocks, the psychic is very strong at ferreting out clues, gathering intel, and uncovering secrets.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c19 c21">Party Face:</span><span class="c6 c1 c10">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Perhaps a bit surprisingly, a psychic can excel in social situations. &nbsp;With access to all major social skills, their divination and enchantment spells can help influence, interrogate, and beguile, particularly if your discipline favors Charisma. &nbsp;Best of all, psychic magic is </span><span class="c5 c1">subtle. &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">No wagging of fingers and speaking gibberish; your focused stare can turn a foe into a friend, or reveal just what the duchess is thinking&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c10 c21">Utility Caster: </span><span class="c1">With limited spells known, you won&rsquo;t have the versatility of the wizard or arcanist, but you get several key problem-solving spells on your list. &nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">Teleport, fly, time stop, telekinesis</span><span class="c4 c1">; the list goes on. &nbsp;Even with your limited spell selection, these are usually good spells to know regardless, and always help grease the gears.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c10 c21">Battlefield Control: </span><span class="c21">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">A psychic can certainly throw down when it comes to battlefield control. &nbsp;They lack most of the </span><span class="c5 c1">fog </span><span class="c1">spells, but make up for it with summons, some good wall spells, and things like </span><span class="c5 c1">black tentacles </span><span class="c1">and </span><span class="c20 c11 c5 c1">etheric shards.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c10 c21">Buffer: </span><span class="c4 c1">A Psychic has respectable access to several useful defensive and offensive buffs. &nbsp;Everybody loves Haste! &nbsp;Psychics even sport a selection of spells capable of removing or alleviating annoying negative statuses. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c19 c21">Debuffer: </span><span class="c4 c1">The Psychic&rsquo;s spell list seems to specialize in spells that cripple an opponent&rsquo;s defenses, physically and mentally. &nbsp;Typically targeting one or a small handful of targets, many of these are also mind-affecting, but the psychic has ways of working around these limitations. &nbsp;A psychic&rsquo;s best combat role is often locking one or two foes down with save-or-lose or save-or-suck effects.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c16 c21">Blaster:</span><span class="c17 c6 c21">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;Arcane casters definitely have the leg-up when it comes to blasting. &nbsp;Most direct-damage spells on the psychic list target only a single foe, and they lack access to most elements other than force and sonic. &nbsp;Even if you want to focus on damage, the psychic is lacking in big, flashy crowd-control spells.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c12 c6 c15">Class Features &amp; Chassis</span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c20 c11 c5 c1">&ldquo;Think of the brain like a muscle. &nbsp;Make it

points/level: </span><span class="c4 c1">You&rsquo;re an INT-based caster, so you&rsquo;ll have no shortage of skill ranks to throw around. &nbsp;Your list of class skills is no slouch:</span></p><p

class="c7"><span class="c6 c16 c21">STR: </span><span class="c21">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">You have no business being in melee combat; you just don&rsquo;t have the HP or BAB to swing it. &nbsp;This is your safest dump stat. &nbsp;Mind your carrying capacity at low levels; if you&rsquo;ve got a handy haversack or someone willing to carry your stuff, you can dump this into the dirt. &nbsp;A 7-10 here isn&rsquo;t hurting anything.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c21">DEX: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">It never hurts to have a decent DEX, especially for Initiative, but many of your offensive spells don&rsquo;t require attack rolls, so your reliance on DEX is pretty mild. &nbsp;A 12-14 or so is fine.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c10 c21">CON:</span><span class="c6 c1 c10">&nbsp; </span><span class="c4 c1">Everybody wants a decent CON for survivability, and to shore up your weak Fort. saves. &nbsp;Hopefully you won&rsquo;t be getting into combat too often to justify anything higher than a 12-14.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c19 c21">INT: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">This is your one-in-all and all-in-one. &nbsp;Embrace the SADness: your spell DCs, bonus spells, skill ranks, and many key skills are all based off of your INT. &nbsp;Pump it as high as you can without sacrificing too much in your other scores, and always prioritize increasing it as you gain levels and wealth. &nbsp;Aim for at least an 18 here at level 1. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c10 c21">WIS: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Most of the best disciplines favor WIS as a secondary score, usually for Phrenic Pool recovery purposes. &nbsp;A good WIS is useful regardless for Perception and Will saves. &nbsp;You can get away with a 10 here, but a WIS-discipline psychic should shoot for a 12-14, and invest in improving it later in your career. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c10 c21">CHA: &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">If your discipline favors CHA, or you just want to be a decent party face, a 12-14 in CHA will serve you well. &nbsp;If you don&rsquo;t care about being a social butterfly, this is another pretty safe </span><span class="c16 c1">dump stat</span><span class="c4 c1">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><a id="id.okfvl7saoszr"></a><p

requirements in mind, certain races possess minds and dispositions better suited to unlocking psychic power. &nbsp;In general, you want to avoid races with an INT penalty (which are pretty rare), while races with an INT bonus make natural choices.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c9 c6">Core Races:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c12 c6 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Dwarf: </span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;The only thing going against dwarves is their lack of an INT boost. &nbsp;Otherwise they make great psychics, particularly those with a WIS-linked discipline. &nbsp;A solid defensive choice, especially for games with heavy dungeon crawling.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Elf: </span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;Elves make excellent psychics. &nbsp;Their Elven Magic trait is always useful for a primary caster, and their racial favored class bonus allows them more use of their phrenic amplifications. &nbsp;The CON hit is the only downside. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Gnome: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Much like dwarves, gnomes have great defenses but little else to truly synergize with the psychic&rsquo;s abilities. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c19">Half-Elf:</span><span class="c6 c1 c10">&nbsp; </span><span class="c4 c1">The half-elf racial favored class bonus is okay if you like phrenic amps. &nbsp;However, the human favored class bonus is amazing, and puts the Half-Elf in the top tier.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Halfling: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Again, no INT bonus makes the Halfling less attractive than other choices. &nbsp;Solid defenses, but you&rsquo;re better served elsewhere.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c26 c6 c25 c1 c19"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c19">Half-Orc: </span><span class="c4 c1">Just like the half-elf, the half-orc&rsquo;s access to the human favored class bonus makes them incredible. &nbsp;Half-orcs make great scary psychics with their Intimidate bonus.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c19">Human: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">The bonus feat and skills alone make humans excellent psychics, but it&rsquo;s their favored class bonus that puts them at the top of the pile. &nbsp;Expanding your spells known is always worth it, and pushes the psychic to the upper limits of Tier 2.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c9 c6">Other Races:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9 c6"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c6 c1">And</span><span class="c6 c16 c1">roid:</span><span class="c6 c1 c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">On the surface, the android makes an amazing psychic, with an INT bonus and everything. &nbsp;The problem is their emotionless quality prevents them from using psychic spells with emotion components (read: most of them). &nbsp;There&rsquo;s a feat that removes this ability, but you&rsquo;re left with an otherwise decent racial chassis minus a more useful feat. &nbsp;You could heavily rely on the Logical Spell metamagic feat, but again you&rsquo;re limiting yourself a great deal. &nbsp;Immunity to fear and emotion magic is a potent defense, but i</span><span class="c1">f you already have to axe emotion components anyway you haven&rsquo;t gained much of anything.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Ratfolk: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Our first example of a small-sized race with an INT bonus, ratfolk make solid psychics. &nbsp;Thematically, they have good synergy with the psychedelia discipline. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Sylph: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">You&rsquo;ll want to swap out Air Affinity for something more useful; otherwise, you&rsquo;ve got an INT bonus and some other solid racial abilities. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Tiefling: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Hey, an INT bonus! &nbsp;And some useful defenses. &nbsp;Swap out Fiendish Sorcerery and you&rsquo;re good to go.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c19">Samsaran: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">INT bonus aside, the real draw here is the Mystic Past Life alternate trait. &nbsp;While Psychics have access to most psychic spells, a few other psychic classes have things you can cherry pick, like Cure spells from the Spiritualist, or Fireball from the Occultist. &nbsp;Things like Animate Dead are particularly game-changing; lots of possibilities here.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Wayang: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">These little guys make pretty good sneaky, creepy psychics. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Lashunta: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">If you want to play alien women from Venus (er, Castrovel), they make perfectly serviceable psychics with built-in telepathy from the get-go.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c16 c1">Wyrwood: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">No sane GM should let you play one of these. &nbsp;Their size, ability scores, and construct immunities make them perfect psychics, but you are nevertheless extremely fragile with no CON score. &nbsp;Barring high-powered games, they&rsquo;re basically broken. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4

c1">Phrenic Amplifications (or phrenic amps) are similar to metamagic feats in that they alter or add rider effects to your spells. &nbsp;You can only &lsquo;attach&rsquo; one phrenic amp to a spell at a time (until level 20). &nbsp;Each phrenic amp has a cost you must pay from your phrenic pool, so your uses will be limited. &nbsp;Several psychic disciplines include a mechanic to replenish some of your phrenic pool, allowing you to further utilize them. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">Interested in psi-tech? &nbsp;Check out </span><span class="c24 c1"><a class="c13" href="#id.vs1eeh9np0jj">Psi-tech Discoveries</a></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c9 c6">Basic Phrenic Amplifications</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">You get three of these before access to major amps, barring feats and racial favored class bonuses. &nbsp;This might not seem like a lot, but there aren&rsquo;t that many must-have amps. &nbsp;Spend feats on the niche ones if you want, otherwise just grab the best ones.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c16 c1">Biokinetic Healing (OO): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">While a form of self-healing is nice, this isn&rsquo;t really worth the cost in points. &nbsp;Several disciplines come with a form of healing if you&rsquo;re interested, but I wouldn&rsquo;t suggest spending a phrenic amp on it.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c12 c6 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c6 c1">Complex Countermeasure: </span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;In a caster-heavy game, I might consider this for a late pick before major amps come online. &nbsp;While having your spells dispelled is a pain, you&rsquo;ll probably want to reserve your pool points for offensive amps. &nbsp;This is handy in a mage-duel situation, but a more traditionally varied game will prevent this from seeing much use.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c6 c1">Conjured Armor: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Given the disposable nature of summons, using limited resources to boost their AC isn&rsquo;t really worth it.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c6 c1">Defensive Prognostication: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Most divination spells aren&rsquo;t really for in-combat use. &nbsp;If you like the Mind Thrust line, though, this could be a handy way to increase your defenses if you&rsquo;re caught unprepared. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c16 c1">Dragon&rsquo;s Breath Focus (OO): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Even if this only cost 1 point, it still wouldn&rsquo;t really be worth it. &nbsp;Typically a burst is superior to a 30 ft. cone in most situations regardless.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c6 c1">Focused Force: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">There aren&rsquo;t a whole lot of damaging force spells on your spell list, and this amp isn&rsquo;t terribly stellar regardless. &nbsp;A 5d4+5 magic missile deals an average of 17.5 damage. &nbsp;This amp would boost that to 22.5; most spells are going to see an increase of 1 or 2 damage per die. &nbsp;Damage isn&rsquo;t your strong suit; I&rsquo;d look elsewhere. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Intense Focus: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">This basically saves you a feat on Combat Casting. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s certainly handy in clutch situations.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Mindshield: &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">This a decent amp for party buffers, but it quickly gets expensive for popular spells like </span><span class="c5 c1">haste</span><span class="c4 c1">. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;ve got a bard in your party, you can easily skip this.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c6 c1">Ongoing Defense: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">The various &lsquo;psychic defense&rsquo; spells are an odd lot, better if you&rsquo;re routinely caught with your pants down. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re prepping correctly and making informed decisions, you probably won&rsquo;t need them, and thus can skip this amp. &nbsp;If you find yourself using one a lot, this isn&rsquo;t a bad amp, but it&rsquo;s probably a late pick before major amps are available in that case.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Overpowering Mind: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">It&rsquo;s expensive, and it only effects mind-affecting spells, but this is probably the best offensive amp in this tier. &nbsp;This is likely to hog 90% of your amp pool for the first half of your career. &nbsp;Pick it up 1st or 3rd level.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c6 c1">Phrenic Strike (OO): &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Only of interest to monk/psychic multiclass builds, this gives you something similar to a magus&rsquo; spellstrike. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re not multiclassing or doing some sort of gestalt build, </span><span class="c14 c11 c25 c1">most psychics should avoid it.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c11 c25 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c16 c1">Psychofeedback (OO): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">First off, this ability is too expensive in terms of phrenic points. &nbsp;You have to burn a 4th level spell to match the power of a 2nd level spell with a fraction of the duration&hellip; &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a bogus deal.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Relentless Casting: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Eventually you&rsquo;ll start running into SR, and when you do, you&rsquo;ll be glad you picked this amp up. &nbsp;A very solid 7th level choice.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c16 c1">Telempathic Restoration (OO): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Burn a point and a spell slot / SLA use to remove certain conditions from your allies&hellip; and apply them to yourself. &nbsp;Note that most of them disrupt emotion components. &nbsp;Pass!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c6 c1">Transfer Fear (OO): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">This is a better deal than Telempathic Restoration, certainly, but you&rsquo;ll still need a way to cast a fear spell without emotion components to get it to work on yourself. &nbsp;Doable, but hopefully a rare enough circumstance that you won&rsquo;t need this.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Undercast Surge: </span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;If you really like the undercast spells, this is very comparable to Overpowering Mind, and it will help stretch out your higher level spell slots. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s nice that it&rsquo;s both offensive and defensive depending on your spell selection. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Will of the Dead: &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Nothing shuts down a caster with lots of mind-affecting spells like the all-too-common undead. &nbsp;This amp is thus rock-solid, a great 1st or 3rd level choice. &nbsp;In undead-heavy campaigns such as Carrion Crown, this sucker jumps up to </span><span class="c26 c11 c25 c1 c19">blue.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c26 c11 c25 c1 c19"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c9 c6">Major Phrenic Amplifications</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">You only get three of these, so choose wisely; Extra Amplification can&rsquo;t get you more.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c6 c1">Deflection Field (OO): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">This is an interesting little ability. &nbsp;There aren&rsquo;t a whole lot of psychic spells that grant a deflection bonus; as best I could tell, your only choices are Shield Other and the Stunning Barrier line. &nbsp;The wording is a bit vague; it seems to me that you only burn points if you want to, and it doesn&rsquo;t even take an action. &nbsp;It also fails to differentiate between magical and non-magical attacks, so you could use it to send ray spells back at their caster. &nbsp;As long as you&rsquo;ve got phrenic points to burn, and boast a good AC or a solid miss chance, this can serve as a sort of all-day spell turning as long as you&rsquo;ve got Shield Other up and running, which isn&rsquo;t too bad a spell on its own.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c26 c17 c6 c25 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c6 c1">Dispelling Pulse: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">For all the limitations and restrictions, this amp is a bit too expensive for what it does. &nbsp;Still, 3 points is cheaper for what amounts to an almost-free Quickened Dispel Magic compared to similar amps, as you&rsquo;ll read below.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Dual Amplification:</span><span class="c6 c1">&nbsp; </span><span class="c4 c1">This is a good 15th or 19th level choice; it eats through your points pretty quickly, but it has wonderful combo potential, primarily through Synaptic Shock abuse. &nbsp;At 20th level, you can sling 3 amps in a round! &nbsp;In an undead-heavy campaign, this jumps up a color, allowing rider effects with Will of the Dead.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Mimic Metamagic: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">It&rsquo;s got &lsquo;metamagic&rsquo; in the name, so you know it&rsquo;s gonna be good. &nbsp;Pick two metamagic feats (even ones you don&rsquo;t know), and you gain the ability to use them on the fly for double their level increase in phrenic pool points. &nbsp;Why isn&rsquo;t this blue? &nbsp;Well, over-reliance on this will drain your pool points fast. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s best used on +1 or +2 level feats, but the best ones you should probably either actually know or have ready in rod form. &nbsp;Thus, this is great for picking up niche feats you only need on occasion, or picking hard-hitting metamagic and tanking the cost for nova situations. &nbsp;Good picks include Persistent Spell, Logical Spell, Enlarge Spell, or Bouncing Spell. &nbsp;Remember: you&rsquo;re trading pool points for higher level spell slots and better action economy, which is a pretty good deal.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Space-rending Spell: &nbsp;</span><span class="c26 c11 c25 c27 c1">This is a fun little ability that&rsquo;s a nice panic button, combining offense with defense. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s too costly for utility; I wouldn&rsquo;t spend more than 3 points unless the chips are down.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c26 c11 c25 c1 c27"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Subordinate Spell: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">If you&rsquo;re interested in Quickening 1st-2nd level spells without sacrificing higher level spell slots, this amp is cheaper than Mimic Metamagic with Quicken Spell. &nbsp;Otherwise, Mimic Metamagic is the better deal; I prefer Mimic Metamagic for double the choices, but this is great for getting up quick buffs if you&rsquo;re routinely caught unawares. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c19">Synaptic Shock: &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Yes, it&rsquo;s mind-affecting only, but it triggers on a successful save! &nbsp;Being confused for even a single round can be a major pain, basically giving you a 75% chance of &lsquo;I win&rsquo; for the round. &nbsp;What really gives this the blue rank is how </span><span class="c5 c1">cheap </span><span class="c4 c1">this is, costing you a measly 1 pool point. &nbsp;Compare to Mimic Metamagic Dazing spell; this amp is a steal, and highly recommended for your 11th level choice. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Telepathic Targeting (OO):</span><span class="c6 c1 c10">&nbsp; </span><span class="c4 c1">This ability is a tad expensive, but it opens up some cool options for buffing and offense. &nbsp;The mind-affecting limitation is the primary concern; on the offense you&rsquo;re only getting use out of this with touch spells, such as Irresistable Dance, but you can provide spell support from any distance if you&rsquo;ve got a telepathic bond up with an ally. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c16 c1">Turning Spell:</span><span class="c6 c1">&nbsp; </span><span class="c4 c1">This ability is far too expensive if you want to turn spells of higher levels (read: the ones capable of doing you the most harm).</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><a id="id.4rt8sdcc3mql"></a><p class="c22"><span class="c12 c6 c15">Psychic Disciplines</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">Half flavor, half mechanics, your choice of discipline colors the sort of psychic you become, nudging you toward certain playstyles. &nbsp;Discipline spells marked with an asterisk are not on the normal psychic spell list.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">Note that certain discipline bonus spells have a higher or lower ranking than when they appear in the larger spell selection section. &nbsp;This is because I am ranking their value as a </span><span class="c5 c1">bonus spell</span><span class="c1">, rather than one of your actual choices. &nbsp;For instance, </span><span class="c5 c1">dream voyage </span><span class="c1">should be avoided by most people, but the dream discipline gets early access as a bonus spell, in which case it&rsquo;s not </span><span class="c5 c1">terrible.</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp; Also, this guide took a while to make, so my opinions on certain spells might have fluctuated!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9 c6"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c9 c6">Abomination (CHA)</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Discipline Spells: </span><span class="c5 c1 c10">ray of enfeeblement*</span><span class="c5 c1">, alter

class="c3"><span class="c20 c11 c5 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c19">Dark Half: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">A sort of &lsquo;psychic rage,&rsquo; for a limited number of rounds per day you get some really nice benefits. &nbsp;The main attraction is the save DC increase and the immunity to fear, providing an excellent defense from Intimidate and similar tactics right out of the gate. &nbsp;The biggest downside is the potential to waste rounds after a fight as you attempt to regain control of yourself, with about a 50% chance of doing so.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c6 c1">Morphic Form: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Free DR while in your Dark Half is nice, but hopefully you&rsquo;re avoiding getting attacked in the first place. &nbsp;Still, it&rsquo;s there if you need it, although rolling to see what type of DR you get each time is a bit annoying. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Psychic Safeguard: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">SR is certainly handy, and it becomes truly legit SR while your Dark Half is up. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Pros: &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Front-loaded with a nice offensive and defensive ability, this is a good choice for those afraid of Intimidate tactics, particularly at low levels. &nbsp;Early access to </span><span class="c5 c1">repulsion</span><span class="c4 c1">, interestingly. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Cons: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">When you&rsquo;re out of Dark Half rounds, this discipline basically does nothing for you until level 13. &nbsp;The discipline spells aren&rsquo;t especially great either. &nbsp;Lastly, there&rsquo;s no phrenic pool recovery mechanic.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4

class="c4 c1">This is a source of phrenic pool replenishment, which is probably the primary use of it for most characters. &nbsp;It works on unconscious creatures, so dying enemies are fair game. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s only 1/hour, and they get a save, so it&rsquo;s not the most reliable thing in the world.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c6 c1">Oneiromancy: &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">This has largely RP/social implications, and until you gain access to </span><span class="c5 c1">dream </span><span class="c4 c1">and similar spells, it requires you to creep on sleeping people directly to use. &nbsp;Possibly of use for interrogating enemies you put to sleep, this is a pretty niche ability. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span

</span><span class="c5 c1">cloak of dreams</span><span class="c4 c1">, so access to sleeping targets won&rsquo;t be quite so difficult to come by. &nbsp;This is an interesting ability for infiltration and scouting, as well as a unique and disturbing tool in a social or intrigue-laden setting. &nbsp;You need to have a buddy watching your back to use it safely, though.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Pros: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Lots of good, creepy flavor, especially for an NPC villain psychic. &nbsp;Make the

spell until level 8 or so, and then you have a nasty dry spell until level 12 when you get </span><span class="c5 c1">cloak of dreams, </span><span class="c4 c1">which requires you to get dangerously close to your targets. &nbsp;Otherwise you have to do a lot of waiting around for people to hit the sack.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">While you can make it work with some effort, this discipline does not lend itself to a typical adventurer&rsquo;s lifestyle. &nbsp;You get early access to </span><span class="c5 c1">dream voyage</span><span class="c4 c1">, but the rest of your spell list is pretty unremarkable. &nbsp;This is largely a villain discipline for devious GMs.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p

class="c7"><span class="c1">The Enlightenment discipline is in many ways a slightly more active Lore discipline. &nbsp;It doesn&rsquo;t give you much of an edge in a fight, but you&rsquo;ll be hard to sneak up on. &nbsp;Overall, this discipline lacks </span><span class="c5 c1">punch. &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s very middle of the road.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4

decent cleric spell, and this ability is like a slightly more potent version of it. &nbsp;The fact that it&rsquo;s a free action to activate makes it that much better. &nbsp;When it matters, you can tweak the numbers of a fight in the favor of your party.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Pros: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Your bonus

&lsquo;psychic,&rsquo; but this is a really strong discipline with essentially no downsides. &nbsp;Most published settings include lots of interesting deities, so there&rsquo;s lots of fun potential for flavor and RP hooks. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re not necessarily affiliated with a church or tied to dogma; you could be a heretic, a lone voice in the wilderness, or a chosen herald.</span></p><p

bonus spell known initially, it becomes downright excellent at the 11th level boost where it becomes permanently active. &nbsp;This basically frees up some spells known for detection abilities like </span><span class="c5 c1">see invisibility </span><span class="c1">or </span><span class="c5 c1">echolocation. &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">You&rsquo;ll be hard to sneak up on, especially after

class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c6 c1">Ferocity: </span><span class="c1">By the numbers, this ability is great for your overall toughness and ability to withstand injury, but the fact that you won&rsquo;t go down until you are </span><span class="c5 c1">dead </span><span class="c1">makes you potentially more of a target. &nbsp;Going unconscious at negative HP is certainly </span><span class="c1 c5">bad, </span><span class="c4 c1">but it often means enemy attention is drawn elsewhere, giving your allies perhaps a chance to wrap things up and heal you once the danger is through. &nbsp;If nothing else, this allows you to hopefully escape once you hit negative health, just be careful; this isn&rsquo;t an excuse to abandon caution. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c16 c1">Primal Fury: </span><span class="c1">In some ways this is </span><span class="c5 c1">worse

on.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Cons: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">The bonus spell list lacks zazz, and it seems to want to direct you towards melee combat, which is not something you should be doing outside of extremely specialized polymorph builds or somesuch. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">For low to mid-level games, this discipline is </span><span class="c5 c1">okay. &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">It lacks focus, but you&rsquo;ll have a bit of extra survivability. &nbsp;The 13th level ability is a waste, and your bonus spell list is oddly lackluster; aside from </span><span class="c5 c1">transformation, </span><span class="c1">none of your bonus spells are </span><span class="c5 c1">bad, </span><span class="c1">but many of them are delayed-access, such as </span><span class="c5 c1">stoneskin </span><span class="c1">and </span><span class="c5

Assault:</span><span class="c17 c6 c1">&nbsp; </span><span class="c1">Assuming you know the Will of the Dead phrenic amp, the only thing this does for you is save you pool points. &nbsp;The main reason I don&rsquo;t like this ability is that it dictates how you allocate your spells known; you HAVE to have at least one spell like </span><span class="c5 c1">mind thrust </span><span class="c1">or </span><span class="c5 c1">psychic crush </span><span class="c4 c1">to benefit from it, and this discipline doesn&rsquo;t have the decency to give you at least one as a discipline spell. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Pros: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">You get a decent number of non-psychic spells on your discipline

make sure you use it! &nbsp;The ability to disable written magical traps is interesting, but is probably only going to be relevant a handful of times over the course of a campaign.</span></p><p

pretty far, but it&rsquo;s a tactic better suited for other classes (and halflings in particular, which aren&rsquo;t the best race for a psychic). &nbsp;Still, it&rsquo;s a phrenic pool recovery

you can just go to town.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Power from Pageantry: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">While this is less advised to do in combat, this is a great ability for buffing or out of combat utility casting.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c6 c1">Force of Habit: &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">While this ability starts okay, there aren&rsquo;t a lot of concentration duration spells that are especially great, and this ability becomes less useful later in your career when swift actions are much more precious. &nbsp;Eventually, this will be a obsolete ability, and the phrenic pool cost is a bit of a nuisance. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s a brief sweet spot when you first get it and spells like </span><span class="c5 c1">id insinuation </span><span class="c1">are still good, but once you get </span><span class="c5 c1">confusion </span><span class="c4 c1">I&rsquo;d probably never touch this ability again.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Unrivaled Focus: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">The phrenic cost is a bit annoying, but nothing sucks more than failing a clutch concentration check. &nbsp;Be judicious with its use. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s also handy for saving a move action when a thought component is involved. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Pros: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">You get some decent bonus spells from the cleric list. &nbsp;Some other nice little perks rounds out the package, especially if you like pre-combat or pre-exploration buffing (which is a wise thing to do!).</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Cons: &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">While decently front-loaded, your 5th and 13th level upgrades range from subpar to underwhelming. &nbsp;This discipline is also suffering from poor editing. &nbsp;Early access to </span><span class="c5 c1">overwhelming presence </span><span class="c4 c1">has been errata&rsquo;d in the past, and the lack of a cap on Ritual Unity is probably an oversight as well. &nbsp;You should talk to your GM about an appropriate 4th level spell replacement.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">You&rsquo;re here mostly for Power from Pageantry and the bonus spell list. &nbsp;In situations where you don&rsquo;t have time to prepare, you&rsquo;re at a marked disadvantage. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">While gaining psychic power from tea ceremonies or pomp and circumstance is a bit odd, this is a decent-to-passable discipline for party cheerleader types. &nbsp;The bonus list gives a lot of fun spells that are difficult to justify taking normally on a spontaneous caster. &nbsp;As an added bonus, you could put &lsquo;M.C.&rsquo; in front of your character&rsquo;s name, and you could call all other psychics &lsquo;suckas.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c26 c17 c6 c25 c21"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c26 c17 c6 c25 c21">Pain (CHA)</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Discipline Spells: </span><span class="c5 c1">persuasive goad*, pain strike, </span><span class="c5 c1 c10">vampiric touch, </span><span class="c5 c1">mass pain strike, synapse overload, mass inflict pain, </span><span

c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c16 c1">Painful Reminder: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">You&rsquo;ll learn to hate this ability. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s almost a waste of time, if it wasn&rsquo;t tied to your phrenic pool recovery mechanic. &nbsp;This also shoehorns you into a damage dealing build, and psychics aren&rsquo;t the best at damage delivery. &nbsp;The final insult is that it eats up your swift action, which will be especially annoying at higher levels.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c16 c1">Power from Pain: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Not all disciplines have a phrenic pool recovery mechanic, but this proves that it&rsquo;s not all it&rsquo;s cracked up to be. &nbsp;This only triggers with your Painful Reminder ability, and only if you deal at least 5 points of damage. &nbsp;Before 8th level it&rsquo;s almost useless.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c19">Live On: &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">And from out of left field, something worth having! &nbsp;Lay on hands, and </span><span class="c5 c1">mercies, </span><span class="c4 c1">as a paladin 3 levels lower. &nbsp;You can&rsquo;t share this with your friends, but it&rsquo;s great for your own selfish survival. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Agonizing Wound: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">If you&rsquo;ve made it this far, this ability takes some of the sting off the damage-dealing role you&rsquo;ve been forced into. &nbsp;Adding some lovely debuffs to your damaging spells is a welcome addition to your arsenal. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Pros: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">You&rsquo;ll be surprisingly tanky from 5th level onward, and if you like the idea of direct damage as a psychic, this gives you some nice tools later in your career.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Cons: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">This discipline is front-loaded with crap, and like a cut in your mouth you can&rsquo;t stop tonguing, the annoyance refuses to go away. &nbsp;If you want to recover phrenic pool points, you have to sacrifice your swift actions on occasion to the crappiness that is Painful Reminder. &nbsp;Your bonus spells are mostly &lsquo;Fort. save or suck,&rsquo; which lacks variety. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">The Pain discipline is&hellip; a bit of a pain. &nbsp;It seems to favor &lsquo;bad touch&rsquo; builds, and the Mind Thrust and Psychic Crush line will probably see ample use. &nbsp;If you want a creepy masochist psychic, you&rsquo;ll find plenty of flavor here, but mechanically there are less frustrating options. &nbsp;Note that you get a lot of spells with the [Evil] descriptor, so they don&rsquo;t get along with paladins.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9 c6"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9 c6"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c9 c6">Psychedelia (WIS)</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Discipline Spells: &nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">polypurpose panacea, mad hallucination, synesthesia, </span><span class="c5 c1

class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Drug Resistance: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Few games ever feature drugs with any regularity. &nbsp;Perhaps a bit ironically, you&rsquo;ll mostly be benefiting from this ability by the drugs you craft or buy yourself. &nbsp;Most drugs aren&rsquo;t worth the effort, but at the very least this is flavorful. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Cognatogen: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">It doesn&rsquo;t last as long as an alchemist&rsquo;s, but this ability remains useful throughout your career, essentially a 1/day buff to your save DCs and defenses at the cost of some ability damage. &nbsp;Fortunately, the INT boost damages STR, which is the score you care the least about.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Warped Brain: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">This is a great defensive ability; remember that you have it! &nbsp;There&rsquo;s a lot of mind-affecting stuff out there, so be sure to try and punish anyone stupid enough to examine your drug-addled mind.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Hallucinogenic</span><span class="c6 c1 c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c17 c6 c1">Aura: &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">This is an extremely potent defensive and offensive tool. &nbsp;Anything not immune to mind-affecting effects is at risk of becoming useless as soon as they get close to you. &nbsp;In a hostile dungeon, this is amazing. &nbsp;In a social setting, it&rsquo;s a liability, because </span><span class="c5 c1">there&rsquo;s no way to turn it off. &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">At high levels, you&rsquo;ll pretty much have to act by proxy in towns and cities, because you risk causing a riot everywhere you go.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Pros: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Probably the best flavor of all the disciplines, you get some nice abilities out of it as well.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Cons: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">The bonus spells don&rsquo;t start getting good until the mid-levels. &nbsp;The biggest downside is no phrenic pool recovery mechanic. &nbsp;Also, in a game featuring lots of social interaction, I would highly suggest avoiding it if you plan on playing post level 13. &nbsp;Depending on the game or the people you&rsquo;re playing with, this discipline could be disruptive.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">Have you ever, like, </span><span class="c5 c1">looked </span><span class="c1">at a d20, man? &nbsp;All those little triangles, but they </span><span class="c5 c1">become something more. &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Whether you want to be comic relief, or just delve into the </span><span class="c5 c1">weird </span><span class="c4 c1">side of the occult, this discipline oozes flavor. &nbsp;Be sure to take Craft (alchemy), and get ready for wackiness if you reach level 13. &nbsp;This is also a good NPC discipline for the enlightened mystic hermit.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c26 c6 c25 c10 c21">Rapport (CHA)</span></p><p

ability doesn&rsquo;t get really good until 4th level, where it basically becomes a bonus spell known. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s handy for party scouts, as you can monitor them from a distance and quickly learn if they&rsquo;re in danger. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Emotional Push: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">This is a handy panic button, and the fact that you can recover phrenic pool points with it is a nice perk.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Share Memory: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Hey, an at-will bonus spell. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll take it.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Team Player: &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Teamwork feats aren&rsquo;t the greatest thing in the world, but you get some freebies, and the </span><span class="c5 c1">coordinated effort </span><span class="c4 c1">spell helps increase their usefulness. &nbsp;This ability is stronger if you&rsquo;ve got an inquisitor, cavalier, or hunter in your group.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Share Skill: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">This is pretty tame for a 13th level ability, but it has its uses. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Pros: &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">This does what is says on the tin, making you an effective team-player. &nbsp;This is the quintessential buffer/cheerleader psychic discipline. &nbsp;Note that when you reach 17th level, you can swap out </span><span class="c5 c1">telepathy </span><span class="c4 c1">for any 5th level spell you want.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Cons: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">None, really, although your phrenic pool recovery mechanic isn&rsquo;t the most dependable thing in the world, and you won&rsquo;t have as much offensive power as other psychics.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">Rapport makes for a great social butterfly and party support psychic. &nbsp;Their bonus spell list is no slouch, and you&rsquo;ll soon become the private hotline for your party&rsquo;s

choice.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c19">Mnemonic Esoterica: &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Sweet Dagon! &nbsp;A floating spell known </span><span class="c5 c1">from any spellcasting class! &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Even if it&rsquo;s one spell level lower than your highest, this is still an </span><span class="c5 c1">amazing </span><span class="c1">ability for a spontaneous caster. &nbsp;Incredible for downtime, magic item creation, or tailoring your spells towards an encounter you know is coming up. &nbsp;Sweet mercy, this is the best CHA-based discipline by a wide margin, for this ability alone. &nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">Entangle, fireball, animate dead, heal, </span><span class="c4 c1">the possibilities are endless&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c6 c1">Resurgence: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">This ability is quite expensive in terms of phrenic points, and isn&rsquo;t even guaranteed to save your life. &nbsp;Hopefully you&rsquo;re not in situations where you can use this very often. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Physical Regression: &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Essentially a bonus spell known in the form of </span><span class="c5 c1">polymorph </span><span class="c4 c1">(which is basically three spells in one itself). &nbsp;It costs phrenic points to use, but it has ten times the normal duration, which is cool. &nbsp;Relatively open ended, it has more utility use than in-combat application. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Pros: &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Front-loaded with savory goodness, Mnemonic Esoterica provides the ultimate resource for a spontaneous caster: versatility. &nbsp;You also get crazy-early access to </span><span class="c5 c1">contact other plane</span><span class="c4 c1">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Cons: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">No phrenic pool recovery mechanic, and your discipline spell list has some mid-to-late career doldrums. &nbsp;However, Mnemonic Esoterica practically makes it a moot point.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">Psychics got a really nice toy out of </span><span class="c5 c1">Occult Origins </span><span class="c1">with this discipline. &nbsp;CHA finally gets to challenge WIS as the superior secondary mental stat for psychics with this beauty. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re here for Mnemonic Esoterica; everything else is just gravy. &nbsp;This discipline begins to blur the border between Tier 2 and Tier 1, it&rsquo;s that good. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c26 c6 c25 c19 c21"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c26 c6 c25 c19 c21">Self-Perfection (WIS)</span></p><p class="c7"><span

class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">AC Bonus: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">This is a handy ability, similar to the monk&rsquo;s AC bonus. &nbsp;Ironically, you&rsquo;ll still probably be better off tromping around in a suit of full plate, but this is nevertheless handy.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Physical Push:</span><span class="c6 c1 c19">&nbsp; </span><span class="c4 c1">This is your phrenic pool recovery mechanic, and it&rsquo;s stupidly easy. &nbsp;A DC 5 acrobatics check gets you a point back. &nbsp;Rolling initiative is an ability check; do you automatically succeed at it? &nbsp;It wouldn&rsquo;t be unreasonable for a GM to rule that you only get a point back if you&rsquo;re actually challenged by the task at hand, in which case this drops to black.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c19">Bodily Purge: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Similar to Pain&rsquo;s Live On ability, this is a great, if selfish, source of healing and negative status removal. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s almost like 3-4 bonus spells known.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c19">Pure Body: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Immunity to poison and disease? &nbsp;On a Fort. weak

bonus spell list, and rock-solid defensive abilities put this in the top tier. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Cons: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Your bonus 6th level spell is a bit of a waste, but I guess it&rsquo;s the price you pay. &nbsp;Your GM might get salty if you abuse the Physical Push recovery mechanic.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">The path to self-perfection leads to true power. &nbsp;The monk-ish psychic&rsquo;s got it good, as the WIS disciplines continue to crush it. &nbsp;This is just a solid, highly defensive option. &nbsp;Your bonus spells cover most essential buffs and self-buffs, freeing up your choices for utility and offense.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c9 c6">Shadow (WIS; BoS)</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Discipline Spells: </span><span

list, limited to 1/day per spell level. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s some good spells on the Darkness domain list, even if it&rsquo;s redundant with a few of your discipline spells. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s an easy phrenic pool recovery mechanic as well, which is nice.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c6 c1">Dark Defense: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">A minor AC buff that doesn&rsquo;t stack with common spells and items, and it&rsquo;s conditional. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll probably be concealed most of the time if you&rsquo;re taking this, but it&rsquo;s just okay.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c6 c1">Adumbration: &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Hide in plain sight is a nice ability&hellip; but

&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Sadly, they&rsquo;re not the greatest spells, particularly your discipline list. &nbsp;Your other abilities range from &lsquo;okay&rsquo; to &lsquo;easily forgettable.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">This is a perfectly functional discipline, but it&rsquo;s on the lower end of the black

class="c4 c1">You&rsquo;ll only get any use out of this in the early levels, before level 5, when the benefits of Metamorphosis are at their weakest. &nbsp;An extra phrenic point is okay, but you&rsquo;ll only have one or two phrenic amps to play with anyway. &nbsp;After level 5, you&rsquo;ll probably never benefit from this ability again.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c12 c6 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Metamorphosis: &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">This is an odd ability, but it serves as the foundation for your later abilities as well. &nbsp;Essentially a stranger version of </span><span class="c5 c1">alter self</span><span class="c1">, you benefit from a physical ability score boost. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s no mention of a bonus to Disguise checks, which there probably should be. &nbsp;If you spend a phrenic pool point, it more closely matches </span><span class="c5 c1">alter self, </span><span class="c1">although the duration drops to hours per level, rather than permanent. &nbsp;Typically you won&rsquo;t want to do this, since the benefits of your later spirit channeling abilities outweigh the mild benefits of </span><span class="c5 c1">alter self. &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1"><br>Basically, just look at this as a bonus to a physical ability of your choice for the most part. &nbsp;A nice perk, but

wandering spirit ability, you can now pick up a 1st level spirit ability from any of the shaman spirits as long as your Metamorphosis ability is active. &nbsp;Most of these are not very useful to a psychic, especially by the time you&rsquo;re level 5. &nbsp;Of the options available to you, the channel ability from the Life spirit is probably the most useful, giving you some helpful healing abilities. &nbsp;The Slums spirit Doors to Everywhere ability is also pretty nice, especially if you&rsquo;re in an urban environment or dungeon. &nbsp;Those options I&rsquo;d rate as </span><span class="c1 c10">green, </span><span class="c1">but most everything else is </span><span class="c16 c1">red </span><span class="c1">to </span><span class="c17 c1">orange</span><span class="c4 c1">, with the melee touch attack energy abilities being the worst, and the other fiddly abilities being slightly better.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c12 c6 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Greater Spirit Channeling: &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">At 13th level you can pick up greater spirit abilities. &nbsp;Most of these remain pretty crappy, but there are a few standouts. &nbsp;The Heavens spirit Void Adaptation opens up some interesting strategies with the ability to see through supernatural darkness. &nbsp;If someone else in your party can cast </span><span class="c5 c1">deeper darkness</span><span class="c1">, you&rsquo;ll have a potent tactical advantage, and the other defensive benefits are nice, including not needing to breathe. &nbsp;Lore&rsquo;s automatic writing ability is handy for downtime. &nbsp;The Slums spirit remains useful: Doors to Everywhere continues to be handy, and the defensive benefits of City&rsquo;s Shroud are nice. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re going to be adventuring underwater, the Waves spirit can net you a swim speed and water breathing. &nbsp;Lastly, Wood&rsquo;s Bloody Roots ability is an interesting battlefield control option, saving you a spell on </span><span class="c5 c1">black tentacles, </span><span class="c4 c1">although the shelf life on that spell is starting to show by level 13.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">One note for both spirit channeling abilities that should be mentioned: there is no language stating that you should count your Psychic level as Shaman levels for purposes of scaling, etc. &nbsp;This is a safe assumption, but it&rsquo;s worth bringing up.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Pros: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">A nice bonus spell list, and decent passive defensive abilities through spirit channeling.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Cons: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">No phrenic point recovery mechanic, and most of your discipline abilities are comparatively tame.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">I like this discipline more on paper than actual execution. &nbsp;This is a fine middle-of-the-road discipline, mostly defensive with a nice bonus spell list. &nbsp;The real problem is the simple disappointing usefulness of shaman spirit abilities; the flexibility of your wandering spirit powers is hampered by the powers themselves being so lackluster, or meant to benefit someone with a better BAB.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c9 c6">Superiority (CHA; PFCC:

of rolls, and replenishes your phrenic pool. &nbsp;Nice! &nbsp;The only downside is it doesn&rsquo;t stack with </span><span class="c5 c1">heroism </span><span class="c4 c1">and its greater version, and might overlap with bardic buffs if you have one on your party.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c12 c6 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">At Arm&rsquo;s Length: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Free metamagic with a built-in cost reducer. &nbsp;Particularly handy if you&rsquo;re interested in bad-touch spells.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c12 c6 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c6 c1">Magical Hoarder: &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">This is a potentially neat trick, but risky; you have to be disconcertingly close. &nbsp;Still, if you can make the Spellcraft check (and you should be able to!), you can piggy-back buffs or healing spells. &nbsp;While it sucks that it doesn&rsquo;t stop the BBEG from casting </span><span class="c5 c1">heal, </span><span class="c1">at least you&rsquo;ll get patched up too. &nbsp;You could also use this to teleport with a bad guy to wherever they&rsquo;re going, but you&rsquo;ll be by yourself, so be careful. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a </span><span class="c5 c1">bit </span><span class="c4 c1">thirsty for phrenic points too, so use your best judgement.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Pros: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Easy and useful phrenic pool recovery mechanic, few frills and fiddly bits.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Cons: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">The spell list is lackluster. &nbsp;Lots of niche-bordering-on-useless, trap, and long-casting time spells that are less useful for on-demand adventuring needs.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">If this discipline had a better spell list, it would be an easy green. &nbsp;As it stands, it has perfectly serviceable and easy-to-use abilities, but there are a lot of stinkers in the spells. &nbsp;Not all of them are really that bad, but they&rsquo;re not spells that your typical spontaneous caster wants or needs on-tap (</span><span class="c5 c1">clone, mage&rsquo;s private sanctum</span><span class="c4 c1">). &nbsp;</span></p><p

c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Sort of like a bonus spell known, this is a handy tool for scouting or spying, especially when combined with your various bonus spells. &nbsp;Animals are pretty common if you know where to look; even the humble rat could help you map out a dungeon level, for instance. &nbsp;The 7th level upgrade saves you spell slots and logistical hurdles.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">One with Nature: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Two bonus spells known, at-will, with some extra benefits. &nbsp;This will help you find those animals, and eventually help you communicate with them, saving you spells known and spell slots.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c6 c1">Bionetwork: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Effectively another bonus spell known, although the various limitations and &lsquo;casting&rsquo; time hamper its usefulness. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c6 c1">Animate Tree: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">A source of disposable minions, although they are slow, and their offensive usefulness is already starting to lag by the time you get this. &nbsp;Handy for destroying objects or buildings, but you&rsquo;re SOL if you&rsquo;re someplace without trees.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Pros: </span><span class="c4 c1">Opens up the plant creature type for enchanters and controllers. &nbsp;Good scouting and spying potential via animals. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Cons: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Bonus spell list is quite specialized; outside of a forest, your tree-based abilities are wasted, and treants aren&rsquo;t the greatest minions either. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">While the flavor of this discipline leans towards a &lsquo;druid psychic,&rsquo; it actually is a fine choice for a controller, telepath, or psychic that wants to play at minionmancy. &nbsp;Your initial abilities are the most handy, especially if you make an effort to seek out animal life. &nbsp;Befriend them, charm them, control them; they are your eyes and ears, and a source of useful information. &nbsp;There will be few creature types you won&rsquo;t be able to charm or control, and you get early access to </span><span class="c5 c1">dominate animal. &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Without access to trees, many of your bonus spells and abilities are wasted, but you&rsquo;ll still be able to pull your weight. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span

c1">Calming Presence:</span><span class="c17 c6 c1">&nbsp; </span><span class="c1">This is basically a bonus spell known, which is nice. &nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">Calm emotions </span><span class="c4 c1">is not the most dependable spell, but it&rsquo;s handy if you&rsquo;re trying to play diplomat.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c19">Purge Disquiet: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Immunity to some of the worst statuses for you, and the ability to help out your friends. &nbsp;This is a great defensive benefit.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Pros: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">A relatively strong bonus spell list at the early and late levels, and solid general defensive abilities with the power to regrain phrenic pool points.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Cons: &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">The mid levels will be a bit of a dry stretch for you, with poor bonus spells (late access to </span><span class="c5 c1">mass daze? &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Thanks?) and a so-so 5th level ability. &nbsp;Once you reach level 13, though, things get much nicer.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">This is a very solid discipline. &nbsp;The mid-level doldrums are what keeps it from hitting blue, especially in comparison to Faith and Self-Perfection. &nbsp;Best for a diplomat, party face, or peace-loving psychic.</span></p><p

psychics don&rsquo;t have a source of bonus feats, so you&rsquo;re going to have to make them count.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">You can take </span><span class="c24 c1"><a class="c13" href="#id.vs1eeh9np0jj">Psi-Tech Discoveries</a></span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;in place of feats.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c9 c6">General Feats</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Additional Traits (APG): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Some traits are really amazing. &nbsp;Handy for expanding your class skills, shoring up saves, or boosting initiative as well.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c6 c1">Augment Summoning: &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Spell Focus (Conjuration) is always something of a feat tax, but it&rsquo;s even more painful for a psychic, since they lack </span><span class="c5 c1">grease </span><span class="c1">and </span><span class="c5 c1">glitterdust</span><span class="c4 c1">. &nbsp;If you pick up some summoning spells (and you should!), I suggest focusing more on utility or just simple cannon fodder. &nbsp;However, this is a prereq for Superior Summoning, which is a great feat.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c6 c1">Careful Reader (OO): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Flavorful, but unlikely to be of use very often.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Combat Casting:</span><span class="c6 c1">&nbsp; </span><span class="c4 c1">Many psychic spells are close range, so you may find yourself in sticky situations. &nbsp;Certainly handy if you can fit it in.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c16 c1">Cranial Adjustment (OO): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">The first (alphabetically) of many feats that concern occult skill unlocks. &nbsp;These aren&rsquo;t really worth your feat selection.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c16 c1">Cranial Implantation (OO): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">See the above feat (even more so! &nbsp;Avoid!).</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c16 c1">Disciplinary Devotee (OA): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">These bonuses are too niche and too mild; don&rsquo;t waste a feat.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Eldritch Heritage (UM): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">For the cost of a Skill Focus feat, you can use this to nab a familiar. &nbsp;Other bloodline powers are of questionable use, but they&rsquo;re there if you want them. &nbsp;This is better for a CHA-based discipline psychic.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c6 c1">Elongated Cranium (OA): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Creepy weirdness aside, I can only recommend this for fronto-occipital elongation for a party face, social psychic. &nbsp;The 1/day free Extend Spell is the best part; none of the other ones are worth it.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c6 c1">Empath (OA): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">I would only consider taking this in a higher level game that featured a lot of RP or social situations. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s too risky to use in a dangerous area.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Expanded Arcana (APG): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Humans and half-humans probably won&rsquo;t need this, but other races can always benefit from more spells known.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c17">Expanded Phrenic Pool (OA): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">For most of the better phrenic amps, this feat gives you basically one more use per day. &nbsp;It just doesn&rsquo;t feel too worth it to me.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c6 c1">Extra Amplification (OA): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">If you could pick major amps, this would be great. &nbsp;As it stands, there are only a few must-have amps, and you can grab them naturally. &nbsp;If you like the sound of one of the more niche amps, though, this is certainly an option.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Familiar Bond, Improved Familiar Bond (FF): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">This is a bit more feat intensive than the Eldritch Heritage route, but Iron Will is arguably more useful than Skill Focus as a prereq. &nbsp;WIS-based discipline psychics might find these feats of interest, as a familiar is a very helpful servant and tool.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Improved Familiar: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">If you took the trouble to get a familiar, one more feat can make your familiar into something truly special. &nbsp;Look for SLAs not on your class list!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Favored Enemy Spellcasting (ACG): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">If you&rsquo;re playing a campaign that features a specific enemy type often, this is better than Spell Focus.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Fortune Teller (ISWG): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">If you&rsquo;re into divinations, this is an easy +1 CL.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c19">Great Fortitude: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Failing a Fort. save is bad news. &nbsp;This helps your squishy body. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re in a particularly nasty game (lots of undead or poison), consider taking the improved version as well.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c16 c1">Haruspicy (OO): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Someone worked really hard on occult skill unlocks, and is very proud of them.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Hidden Presence, Manipulative Presence, Intrusive Presence (OA): &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">These feats are all useful if you plan on using the </span><span class="c5 c1">possession </span><span class="c4 c1">line of spells and generally being a creep. &nbsp;If it weren&rsquo;t for the intensive feat investment, I&rsquo;d rank them higher; you either commit to this or you don&rsquo;t. &nbsp;That said, Intrusive Presence can have nightmarish repercussions. &nbsp;Definitely a mid to late game consideration.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Iron Will: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Even though Will is your strong save, and you&rsquo;ll have lots of spells and class features to improve it even further, nothing messes with your casting ability like a failed Will save. &nbsp;Every little bit helps. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll be happy to have the improved version when you need it as well; consider taking it in a very caster-heavy or occult-y game.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c6 c1">Keif Addict + others (GTK): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">If you&rsquo;d like to make more use of the drug rules as a psychedelia discipline psychic, these give you some flavorful options. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Lightning Reflexes: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Although Reflex is likely to be your worst save, I wouldn&rsquo;t bother investing too much into it unless you&rsquo;re in a dragon-heavy campaign or something.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c16 c1">Lucid Dreamer (OA): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">This feat is almost entirely fluff and flavor, barring extremely niche circumstances. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re playing in a game that heavily features dream-dimension stuff, and your GM rules you can gain XP from dream adventures, this becomes obviously better.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Lunging Spell Touch (ACG): &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">You&rsquo;re probably better off with </span><span class="c5 c1">spectral hand </span><span class="c4 c1">if you want to use touch spells, but this is an interesting option at higher levels.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Mage&rsquo;s Tattoo (ISWG): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">This is an easy +1 to CL if you&rsquo;re already taking Spell Focus.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c6 c1">Psychic Combatant (OA):</span><span class="c6 c16 c1">&nbsp; </span><span class="c4 c1">This makes the first thought-form creature you make free (or almost-free), a strong opening move. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s nice that it&rsquo;s got some out-of-psychic-duel utility, but in general, psychic duels are an inefficient use of your resources. &nbsp;See the Appendix for more on psychic duels. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c16 c1">Psychic Defender (OA): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Your own hp pool is less important than making a tanky thought-form creature. &nbsp;Skip this.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c16 c1">Psychic Healer (OA): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Even if you pick up Heal as a class skill somehow, the faith healing unlock isn&rsquo;t really that great, mainly due to the amount of time it takes. &nbsp;During downtime it&rsquo;s fine, but you probably shouldn&rsquo;t blow a feat on a downtime activity unless it&rsquo;s item creation.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c12 c6 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c6 c1">Psychic Maestro (OA): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Investing resources into the occult skill unlocks is unadvised. &nbsp;They&rsquo;re flavorful and fun, but there are stronger options. &nbsp;A Lore discipline psychic might consider this just to get some more use out of their 5th level ability.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c6 c1">Psychic Virtuoso (OA): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">See above.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c16 c1">Rhabdomancy (OO): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">This is here if you want to be better at dowsing&hellip; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c16 c1">Sacred Geometry (OM): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Please don&rsquo;t use this feat. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve never seen anything with the potential to grind a game to a screeching halt like this monstrosity. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c6 c1">Shadow Gambit (ISM): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">It isn&rsquo;t the greatest, but this is a pretty cool feat, particularly if you like illusions. &nbsp;It can even give the psychic some almost-fake area of effect damaging spells.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c16 c1">Shatter Mental Mask (OA): &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Of all the psychic duel feats, this one is the most esoteric, and thus probably least worth your time. &nbsp;It has a chance to reveal mystery opponents to you, but that&rsquo;s likely only going to matter in a very intrigue-laden game.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c6 c1">Skeleton Summoner (UM): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">This helps you become a fake necromancer. &nbsp;Oddly enough, there&rsquo;s a lot of decent necromancy spells on your class list; try charming undead with your phrenic amps to really confuse people.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Skill Focus: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Take it as a prereq for things like Eldritch Heritage if need be. &nbsp;If you grab UMD as a class skill through a trait, this is also a decent option to expand your versatility. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c16 c1">Spectrum Sight (OO): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">The read aura occult skill unlock might be the least useful of them all.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Spell Focus, Greater Spell Focus: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">If you wind up favoring a certain school, these feats are a great help, particularly for enchantment and illusion. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Spell Penetration, Greater Spell Penetration: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">You&rsquo;ve got phrenic amps to help you with this, but SR is a real pain, and every boost helps. &nbsp;Of particular value in an outsider-heavy campaign.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c19">Spell Perfection (APG): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">It&rsquo;s a long wait, but this is a high-level gem. &nbsp;Pick your favorite spell and go to town.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Spell Specialization (UM): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">This is a nice feat if you find yourself relying on a specific spell a lot, especially in combat. &nbsp;It becomes less useful towards the late mid levels; I might consider retraining it by level 10 or so.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c6 c1">Spirit Sense (OA): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">If you find yourself in a particularly haunted game, this feat could be of some use, but otherwise I suggest having contingencies, i.e. know a force spell or two.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Spontaneous Metafocus (UM): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">If you&rsquo;ve got a decent CHA, and have a favored combat spell, this combos well with the metamagic feat of your choice.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Steadfast Personality (ACG): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">If you&rsquo;re a CHA discipline psychic, this feat helps alleviate MADness by allowing you to ignore WIS entirely and still have a great Will save.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Steel Soul (APG): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">If you&rsquo;re playing a dwarf, this is a solid choice.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Superior Summoning (UM): &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">If you&rsquo;re interested in summoning, this is the single best way to flood the battlefield with disposable meat sacks. &nbsp;It only gets better with age.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c16 c1">Third Eye (OA): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">This is garbage. &nbsp;Just hot garbage. &nbsp;SKIP.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Toughness: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Essentially +2 to CON for hp purposes, this is always useful on your squishy chassis. &nbsp;Better for humans and half-humans who are using their favored class bonus for more useful things.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c16 c1">Trepanation (OO): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Gross.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c16 c1">Truth in Wine (OO): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Hey, at least you can get your drank on.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c16 c1">Xenoglossy (OA): &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">I like this feat, I really do. &nbsp;But you get telepathy and all sorts of other magical options to communicate. &nbsp;This feat isn&rsquo;t for you</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c9 c6">Combat Feats</span></p><p class="c22 c23"><span class="c9 c6"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c16 c1">Armor Proficiency (light, medium, heavy): </span><span class="c17 c6 c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">psychic magic has no somatic components, so armor doesn&rsquo;t inhibit your spells in any way. &nbsp;Many of your offensive spells don&rsquo;t require attack rolls, so if you want, you could theoretically stomp around in full plate awkwardly and tank the attack penalty. &nbsp;Most psychics will do just fine with a mithril chain shirt and a MW buckler / darkwood heavy shield if they&rsquo;re feeling especially fancy.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Defensive Combat Training: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">This feat benefits you more than &frac34; BAB types. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c19">Improved Initiative: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Is there a guide out there where this isn&rsquo;t blue? &nbsp;Going first means getting your spells off before something bad happens. &nbsp;Always worth picking up if you can.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c9 c6">Item Creation Feats</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c12 c6 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">If you&rsquo;re in a campaign that has plenty of downtime, you might consider item crafting feats; you&rsquo;re basically trading feats for more magic gear, which can be worth it. &nbsp;You have a harder time meeting prereqs than wizards or arcanists, but it&rsquo;s not an insurmountable obstacle. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c19">Craft Rod: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">This is likely a late-game pick. &nbsp;The more powerful metamagic rods are extremely expensive, but they&rsquo;re arguably more useful than knowing the feats themselves. &nbsp;A worthy investment, certainly.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Craft Wand: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">This is nice if you&rsquo;re especially paranoid about fear effects, and don&rsquo;t get access to blanket fear immunity. &nbsp;A wand of Remove Fear is nice and cheap, and can help get you back in the fight. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s all sorts of spells that are handy to have in wand-form.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Craft Wondrous Item: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Probably the best item creation feat for the sheer volume of wondrous items out there; the possibilities are almost endless. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c9 c6">Metamagic Feats</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">As a spontaneous caster, metamagic feats are a bit more annoying to use in combat. &nbsp;There are ways to get around it, but you&rsquo;ll often be better served by metamagic rods. &nbsp;Still, knowing at least three is a prereq for Spell Perfection. &nbsp;I recommend feats useful outside of combat if possible.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Extend Spell: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Possibly the most popular metamagic feat, this is an old standby that&rsquo;s great for buffing before a dungeon delve. &nbsp;Gets less useful later in your career.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c16 c1">Intuitive Spell (OA): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">You can negate the downside of thought components with a move action; using this feat will take a full round action. &nbsp;Thus, it&rsquo;s basically useless.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Logical Spell (OA): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">The big weakness of psychic magic is emotion components. &nbsp;There are ways to defend against negative emotion effects, but inevitably something&rsquo;s going to get through. &nbsp;This is handy in rod form, but you won&rsquo;t regret simply knowing this feat either. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Persistent Spell (APG):</span><span class="c6 c1">&nbsp; </span><span class="c1">You&rsquo;ll be forcing a lot of saving throws over the course of your career. &nbsp;This is the feat to use when you </span><span class="c5 c1">have </span><span class="c4 c1">to stick that save-or-lose. &nbsp;Combos well with phrenic amps for particularly desperate straights. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Piercing Spell (UM): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">In a game that heavily features SR, this feat is probably green. &nbsp;It stacks with Spell Penetration and phrenic amps, and is a pretty modest level adjustment.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c19">Quicken Spell: &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Ah, Quicken Spell. &nbsp;Trade higher level slots for superior action economy. &nbsp;Old wisdom suggests grabbing this around level 11 or 13. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll finally have the slots to use it, and you probably won&rsquo;t have access to rods for several more levels. &nbsp;You might consider retraining it once you get 9th level spells, as </span><span class="c5 c1">divide mind </span><span class="c4 c1">renders it largely obsolete. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c9 c6">Teamwork Feats</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">These are mostly of concern to the Rapport discipline psychic. &nbsp;Most of these are designed for people fighting in the heat of the fray, which is where you don&rsquo;t want to be. &nbsp;As such, I&rsquo;m going to just mention the ones possibly worth your bonus feat slots as a Rapport psychic.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Lookout (APG): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">This is insurance against being surprised, which can spell your doom. &nbsp;No prereqs, just stick near your buddy in a danger zone.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Tribe Mentality (KoG): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">compulsions and emotion effects are bad news for your psychic magic. &nbsp;This feat is nice in that you don&rsquo;t need to be adjacent to your buddy, and there&rsquo;s no prereqs. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><a id="id.f5quknsn1d0b"></a><p class="c22"><span class="c12 c6 c15">Trait Selection</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">If your game features the optional trait rules (and most seem to these days), you basically have two options: pick something flavorful or appropriate for your backstory, or min-max them like the conniving Munchkin you are. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ll be looking at &lsquo;optimal&rsquo; traits, many of which are basically half-feats. &nbsp;There are so many of these damn things, from so many different sources, that I&rsquo;m basically going to throw up my hands and say &lsquo;look them up on the SRD.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c19">Reactionary: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">This applies to any similar initiative-boosting trait. &nbsp;Going first is very important, so any trait that boosts this for you is gold.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c19">Magical Lineage: &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">One of the only examples of metamagic reducers in Pathfinder, a wisely-picked spell coupled with this feat is potent indeed. &nbsp;Combined with </span><span class="c5 c1">remove fear</span><span class="c4 c1">, you&rsquo;ll have a defense against emotion component disruption from level 1. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c19">Dangerously Curious: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Traits that give you new class skills are great. &nbsp;This one gives you Use Magic Device, which couples well with CHA-discipline psychics. &nbsp;UMD will greatly expand your versatility, as well as give you something to do if you&rsquo;re locked out of emotion components by fear or what-have-you.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c19">Resilient: &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Any of the save-boosting traits are great. &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Fort.</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;in particular is a weakness deserving of mention, but really any of these are a solid choice.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Focused Mind: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Most folks might not have the room to fit in a feat like Combat Casting. &nbsp;Traits like this are a nice compromise. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c19">Fate&rsquo;s Favored: &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Awesome for half-orcs with the sacred tattoo racial trait, this is a handy trait for anybody really. &nbsp;Pick up a four leaf clover or a luckstone!</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c12 c6 c15"></span></p><p class="c22 c23"><span class="c12 c6 c15"></span></p><p class="c22 c23"><span class="c12 c6 c15"></span></p><a id="id.bmao2xcekz8n"></a><p class="c22"><span class="c12 c6 c15">Archetypes</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">There are four archetypes for the psychic included in Occult Adventures. &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s take a look:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9 c6"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c9 c6">Amnesiac</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c12 c6 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">Amnesiac is an odd archetype. &nbsp;All it alters is your spells known, and adds a mechanic to &lsquo;remember&rsquo; new spells somewhat on the fly. &nbsp;This is a decent archetype for flavor, or for the indecisive who wish to &lsquo;test drive&rsquo; spells before locking them in. &nbsp;It doesn&rsquo;t really improve your flexibility as much as you might think; you only gain &lsquo;amnesiac slots&rsquo; for your two highest spell levels, and the fact that you round up from your normal spells known means you&rsquo;ll usually just have two &lsquo;wild card&rsquo; spells a day. &nbsp;While this is more than a normal psychic technically, you can only attempt to remember a new spell once per hour. &nbsp;Depending on the pace of your game, this could very well mean you only get to use this ability once per major event in the story, and it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily benefit pre-adventure buffing more than a normal psychic with a solid selection of spells known.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">For a slower paced campaign with lots of downtime, this archetype </span><span class="c1 c19">is significantly more useful. &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">You can pick up more niche spells that a spontaneous caster would be less inclined to take, such as certain divinations, the </span><span class="c5 c1">create demiplane </span><span class="c4 c1">spells, or more niche healing spells. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">Weirdly, this archetype is most effective post level 18, when you can cycle through the 9th level spells and rent the more niche or less attractive ones. &nbsp;There are precious few ways to expand your 9th level spells known, and in this area the amnesiac has a certain advantage. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">This archetype is more attractive to non-human characters with a more limited spell selection. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s fun, but it can also be unnecessarily complicating things. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s also unique in that should your memory ever be truly restored, you revert back to a normal psychic. &nbsp;Basically, if your GM gets tired of it, he can take it away from you at the drop of a hat. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s worth noting that this archetype stacks with all other archetypes.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c9 c6">Formless Adept &nbsp;(CHA)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">Formless Adept is best viewed as a &lsquo;super discipline,&rsquo; since it basically replaces a normal discipline while &lsquo;locking&rsquo; a few phrenic amp choices. &nbsp;This is here for people that liked the Psion Uncarnate from the 3.5 days of old. &nbsp;It has some cool abilities, but it lacks &lsquo;endurance&rsquo; compared to regular psychics; once you&rsquo;re out of formless body uses for the day, you basically have no class features other than your spells and phrenic amps. &nbsp;It also lacks a phrenic pool replenishment mechanic, which holds it back from a better rating as well.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">This archetype favors touch spells, mind-control, and generally being creepy and spooky. &nbsp;You make a pretty good spy and scout with this as well.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Formless Body: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">This ability starts off as mostly crap, but gets better if you stick it out. &nbsp;While the defensive benefits are nice, the main reason it&rsquo;s a pain is that your bonus spells can only be cast while using it. &nbsp;Your Formless Spell amp helps this a bit, but it ultimately means that your access to bonus spells is more limited than a normal psychic&rsquo;s. &nbsp;From 5th level onward it shouldn&rsquo;t be too much of a hindrance once you get access to the 1-minute increment versions. &nbsp;Remember that your daily allotment of minutes and rounds per day has a separate pool for each of the three forms. &nbsp;A 13th level formless adept with an 18 Charisma would have 7 minutes of blurred body, 7 minutes of gaseous body, and 7 rounds of incorporeal body a day.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Formless Spell: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">This is an automatic pick for your first phrenic amp. &nbsp;It takes some of the action economy sting off of your formless body ability, but with no way to replenish pool points, every time you use it will be precious indeed.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Bonus Spells: &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">To compensate for your limited bonus spell access, you get double the bonus spells, and their durations are not tied to your formless body usage, which is a kindness. &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s take a look: &nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">chill touch* + expeditious retreat, </span><span class="c5 c1 c10">levitate </span><span class="c5 c1">+ stricken heart, </span><span class="c5 c1 c19">gaseous form </span><span class="c5 c1">+ </span><span class="c5 c1 c10">vampiric touch</span><span class="c5 c1">, </span><span class="c5 c1 c10">shadow step </span><span class="c5 c1">+ </span><span class="c5 c1 c10">telekinesis</span><span class="c5 c1">, </span><span class="c5 c1 c19">dominate person </span><span class="c5 c1">+ </span><span class="c5 c1 c10">synapse overload</span><span class="c5 c1">, </span><span class="c5 c1 c10">disintegrate</span><span class="c5 c1 c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">+ enemy hammer, finger of death + </span><span class="c5 c1 c10">telekinetic sphere</span><span class="c5 c1">, </span><span class="c5 c1 c10">etherealness</span><span class="c5 c1 c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">+ power word stun, </span><span class="c5 c1 c19">dominate monster </span><span class="c5 c1">+ </span><span class="c5 c16 c1">telekinetic storm</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">That&rsquo;s a pretty strong list of bonus spells, certainly competitive with the best discipline lists. &nbsp;Try to save uses of formless body so that you aren&rsquo;t &lsquo;locked out.&rsquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c6 c1">Psychic Possession:</span><span class="c6 c16 c1">&nbsp; </span><span class="c5 c1">Greater possession </span><span class="c4 c1">is a fine spell, one you very well might consider learning given your proclivities. &nbsp;Your incorporeal body is always going to be extremely limited in duration, which means this is best used in a combat once or twice a day. &nbsp;You can probably cause some damage with it, certainly, but I&rsquo;d much rather just learn the spell and have my 15th level phrenic amp.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Formless Master: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Your capstone isn&rsquo;t as good as remade self, but it does improve your formless body ability; it&rsquo;s okay. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c6 c25 c21"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14 c6 c25 c21">Mutation Mind</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;Oof. &nbsp;This archetype is painful. &nbsp;Unless you like the flavor, I&rsquo;d highly suggest skipping it. &nbsp;The Strength bonuses you get are pretty much wasted on your squishy chassis; you don&rsquo;t want to be punching things! &nbsp;The fact that your INT takes a hit while you&rsquo;re under the influence is the real travesty here. &nbsp;There are a few tools that a touch-spell focused psychic might consider&hellip; until 7th level and Phrenic Empowerment rears its ugly head. &nbsp;Using your phrenic amps then becomes a liability as you risk further damaging your INT score should you be hurt in a fight. &nbsp;Stay far away from this one.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c6 c21">Psychic Duelist</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">Psychic duels are a risky, costly endeavor. &nbsp;As-written, barring a very intrigue-laden, highly psychic sort of game, they&rsquo;re probably best avoided. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re basically focusing an archetype, and possibly some feats, on a single spell. &nbsp;If you really like the idea of X-Men-style tests of mental might, you can make it work, and this archetype will make you better at it than anyone else. &nbsp;This is sort of like being the grand-master of using poison; nice on paper, but usually more trouble than it&rsquo;s worth.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">With all of that said, you don&rsquo;t actually lose a whole lot from this archetype: you replace a bonus spell known, a phrenic amp, and your higher level SLA&rsquo;s, which isn&rsquo;t too steep a price to pay. &nbsp;In exchange, you learn </span><span class="c5 c1">instigate psychic duel </span><span class="c4 c1">with a built-in auto-Heighten, can learn manifestation-amps instead of phrenic amps, and by level 9 can use psychic duel attacks on creatures even if they&rsquo;re not actually in a psychic duel. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">The level 9 ability is interesting; it reminds me of the Words of Power system, in that you can spontaneously generate attacks on the fly, targeting whatever saves or AC you want, possibly even inflicting negative statuses. &nbsp;Instigating actual duels still have benefits, especially if you&rsquo;ve picked up the dueling feats, and it requires a full-round action to use, so it&rsquo;s not very efficient action-economy wise. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m surprised there&rsquo;s no range limit or other restrictions here; you could possibly murder someone in a crowded feast hall and nobody would be the wiser.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">Even with the 17th level Expert Manifester ability, using these abilities will eat through your spell slots pretty quickly. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><a id="id.sjlwl46vryn3"></a><p class="c22"><span class="c12 c6 c15">Equipment Considerations</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">Your mind might be a powerful weapon, but a siege engine can&rsquo;t operate without support. &nbsp;Items magical and mundane will make your job easier, keep you alive, and do the opposite for the enemy. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c9 c6">Mundane Gear:</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c6 c1">Full Plate Armor:</span><span class="c6 c1">&nbsp; </span><span class="c4 c1">Even though you don&rsquo;t care about attack rolls in all likelihood, non proficiency and armor check penalties do apply to Dex-based ability checks, including Initiative, which you don&rsquo;t want to penalize if possible. &nbsp;That said, at very high levels you could slap various special abilities and materials on a suit of full plate to lower the ACP to 0 or so. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c19">(Mithral) Chain Shirt: &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Perhaps a bit more reasonable, a mithral shirt isn&rsquo;t outrageously expensive, and can be enchanted further. &nbsp;No armor check penalty, and it&rsquo;s strictly better than </span><span class="c5 c1">mage armor. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Darkwood Heavy Shield / Mithral Heavy Shield: &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">The </span><span class="c5 c1">shield </span><span class="c4 c1">spell is hard to beat, but these don&rsquo;t cost you spell slots or spells known, and can be enchanted to match and eventually surpass it. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Light Crossbow: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">At low levels, a ranged weapon is better than most damaging cantrips.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Dagger: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">It&rsquo;s handy to have a backup weapon for desperate situations. &nbsp;A dagger is nice for utility as well.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Automatic Writing Planchette (OA): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">The DCs for the automatic writing occult skill unlock are pretty high; this thing&rsquo;s an easy +2 for cheap. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Occult Reference Material (OA): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">If you&rsquo;ve got the time, this is a modest investment for a nice bonus on topics that might be common in an occult campaign. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Prismatic Crystal (OA): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">These are nifty little trinkets; you might as well enjoy the benefits of being psychic! &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c12 c6 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Spirit Trumpet (OA): &nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">Ghost sound </span><span class="c1">and </span><span class="c5 c1">ventriloquism </span><span class="c4 c1">are both pretty handy spells, and this mundane item boosts their disbelief save DC by 1. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a steal. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c12 c6 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Talking Board (OA): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">This cheap item gives you all sorts of useful goodies in a spooky occult game, especially if there&rsquo;s more than one occult character in the party.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c12 c6 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c9 c6">Alchemical Gear:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">There&rsquo;s lots of handy alchemical items; a psychedelia discipline psychic benefits from having Craft (alchemy) ranks in particular.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Magnetized Paper (OA): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Another boost to the automatic writing occult skill unlock for those interested.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Acid, Alchemist&rsquo;s Fire, &amp; others: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Area-effect damage isn&rsquo;t the psychic&rsquo;s strong suit, and these items will be particularly handy the first time you fight a swarm at low levels.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Antitoxin, Antiplague: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">If you know you&rsquo;re heading into a poisonous or disease-ridden zone, these items are a cheap way to bolster your weak Fort. saves.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c9 c6">Magic Items:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c12 c6 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c19">Headband of Vast Intelligence: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Make peace with your headband slot, because you&rsquo;ll want the best one of these you can afford. &nbsp;Later in your career, you&rsquo;ll want to spring for a Headband of Mental Prowess boosting both INT and your discipline&rsquo;s ability if you can.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Belt of Mighty Constitution / Incredible Dexterity: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">You can probably snag one of these as a hand-me-down from a melee character. &nbsp;These are primarily for shoring up your defenses and boosting initiative. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c19">Cloak of Resistance: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Boring, yes, but saving throws are important. &nbsp;Faith discipline psychics get a bit more flexibility here.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c19">Hat of Disguise: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">These things are just the best. &nbsp;In an intrigue heavy or social game you can get up to all kinds of mischief. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c19">Handy Haversack: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Useful for lugging your stuff around, especially if you dumped STR.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Runestones of Power (ACG): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">These are basically pearls of power for spontaneous casters. &nbsp;They&rsquo;re certainly handy, but they are quite expensive for what they do, and you shouldn&rsquo;t be particularly strapped for spell slots. &nbsp;Probably not worth purchasing, but you can put them on your wish list for inquiring GMs&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c16 c1">Ring of Psychic Mastery (OA): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">With the above in mind, it&rsquo;s actually cheaper to own runestones of power, levels 1 - 4, than it is to buy this ring, which does what those four runestones would do while eating up a ring slot. &nbsp;IT&rsquo;S A TRAP!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c16 c1">Ring of the Hidden Psyche (OA): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">This isn&rsquo;t something you buy; it&rsquo;s a plot device.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c19">Metamagic Rods: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">You want these! &nbsp;Ideally several different kinds. &nbsp;Some are very reasonably priced, such as the lesser rod of extend. &nbsp;Others are outrageously expensive, but still incredibly useful and powerful. &nbsp;On your wishlist: Quicken, Persistent, Logical, and Piercing to name a few.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c19">Pages of Spell Knowledge (UE) / Spell Lattices (ACG): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Paying money for more spells known is a worthy exchange. &nbsp;They get pretty expensive for higher level spells, so these are best reserved for niche or utility spells you&rsquo;d prefer not to have in wand form. &nbsp;The 1st level ones are a steal; anything higher than 3rd level is getting a bit too expensive. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Wands: &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">1st level wands are the best deal. &nbsp;Wishlist: </span><span class="c5 c1">endure elements, remove fear, air bubble. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Staves: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Staves are expensive, but they&rsquo;re a nice tool to stretch out your adventuring endurance in higher level play. &nbsp;Typically, you find one in a treasure pile that you can use. &nbsp;You might have trouble finding a staff you can use without UMD, since most staves feature flashy blast spells not on your list, or else healing spells. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll probably wind up with something abjuration, enchantment, illusion, or divination-focused. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Potions: &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Potions are handy, especially if you&rsquo;re under a fear or negative emotion effect. &nbsp;Potions of </span><span class="c5 c1">remove fear </span><span class="c4 c1">should always be on hand, as well as healing potions.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Dreamcatcher (OA): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">In an occult game featuring lots of dream-wackiness, this is a pretty cheap item that gives you a nice defensive edge during sleepytime. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">False Coin (OA): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Nice and cheap, but surprisingly handy in an intrigue-laden game.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Flying Skiff / Flying Sled (OA): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">These things are preposterously expensive, but if you can manage to construct one yourself, they&rsquo;re a pretty stylish way to get around. &nbsp;Seems to be asking your GM to destroy it in a climactic encounter, though&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c19">Four-Leaf Clover (OA): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Much cheaper than a luckstone, these are handy little trinkets useful for any character. &nbsp;Even better if you&rsquo;ve got the Fate&rsquo;s Favored trait.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Lucky Horseshoe (OA): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Much like the four-leaf clover, this is like a discount luckstone. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s nice that it&rsquo;s &lsquo;always on,&rsquo; but you can probably get by with a four-leaf clover until later in your career.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c6 c1">Orgone Accumulator (OA):</span><span class="c6 c16 c1">&nbsp; </span><span class="c4 c1">If you&rsquo;ve got a permanent base, lots of time on your hands, and no divine caster in your party, I suppose this weird item would be worth having around. &nbsp;As a high-level adventurer, your time is precious, dammit! &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Shrunken Head (OA): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">This creepy doodad is extremely expensive, but if you&rsquo;re into fear spells it&rsquo;s a nice high-level toy with built-in defense.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c10">Talismans (OA): &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">You don&rsquo;t have a whole lot of high-priority things for your neck slot, so the various talismans are pretty nifty to have around. &nbsp;Obviously the greater ones are better in the long run, but the lesser ones are handy in a pinch. &nbsp;Danger sense, freedom, good fortune, and life&rsquo;s breath are the real stand-outs. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><a id="id.baa2yptjh9la"></a><p class="c22"><span class="c12 c6 c15">Spell Selection</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">For all your phrenic amps, discipline abilities, feats, and items, nothing is more important than your spell selection. &nbsp;Anything that expands your basic allotment of spells known is a really good thing: human favored class bonus, spell lattices, and the Expanded Arcana feat are all mega-useful. &nbsp;More spells known means more versatility; every expansion pushes you closer to Tier 1. &nbsp;While a 20th level human psychic may not technically be Tier 1, they&rsquo;ll know so many spells that they might as well be.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">The psychic spell list is no slouch. &nbsp;It draws from multiple sources, from core to the APG, ACG, UM, and others. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll find druid spells, witch spells, inquisitor spells, and a few cleric spells. &nbsp;The psychic also gets exclusive access to a number of unique spells, including the &lsquo;undercast&rsquo; spells (psychic bloodline sorcerer excluded). &nbsp;As mentioned previously, its main &lsquo;weakness&rsquo; is a lack of flashy direct damage attack spells. &nbsp;Mopping up crowds of mooks is not your job; leave that to the sorcerers and wizards. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll be very strong at information gathering, mental and emotional manipulation, buffing, and debuffing. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">As a general rule of thumb, try not to double up on spells that are too similar to each other. &nbsp;Try to have spells that target a variety of saving throws, and grab a few that have no save allowed or effects on a successful save. &nbsp;While offense is important, don&rsquo;t skimp on defense, and be sure to make room for a utility spell of every spell level you can cast if you can. &nbsp;Your discipline and archetype will supplement your selection and often make certain playstyles easier. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t forget you can swap out spells known starting at 4th level and every even level afterwards; this is a great opportunity to grab utility or niche lower level spells as your lower level offensive spells become obsolete. &nbsp;If you like the undercast spells, grabbing the latest version of one allows you to instantly replace lower level versions, giving you some nice versatility.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">Below I breakdown noteworthy spells for each spell level, primarily focusing on essentials spells and possible &lsquo;trap&rsquo; spells that aren&rsquo;t worth knowing. &nbsp;I also note how many you&rsquo;ll know, not counting discipline spells; the number with an asterisk is the number known if you pick the human favored class bonus at every level, assuming you select the highest level spell possible at each level (max spell level -1).</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><ul class="c18 lst-kix_fcv2zwyvbzrj-0 start"><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c24 c1"><a class="c13"

you can &lsquo;learn&rsquo; any of these spells for a pretty modest fee.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">Standouts: </span><span class="c20 c11 c5 c1">charm person, enlarge person, heightened

class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1 c19">burst of adrenaline </span><span class="c5 c1">- </span><span class="c4 c1">This is actually a pretty cool spell. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s basically +4 to a Ref. or Fort. save, and has utility outside of combat. &nbsp;The round of fatigue afterwards is a bit of a pain, so use judiciously. &nbsp;</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c16

really wants you to take this spell. &nbsp;The casting time is obnoxious, though, and it doesn&rsquo;t really do a whole lot. &nbsp;You can basically use it to leave secret messages to other psychic characters, which is only useful in an intrigue-heavy campaign. &nbsp;More likely, this is an NPC spell for GMs to leave clues for psychic characters to discover. &nbsp;</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1 c10">charm animal </span><span class="c1">- You can get </span><span class="c5 c1">speak with animals </span><span class="c4 c1">as a 2nd level spell; animals can be an unlikely source of information, and you&rsquo;ll be glad to know this the first time you encounter a T-Rex.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">charm person</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">color spray</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c17 c5 c1">decrepit disguise </span><span class="c4 c1">- another one of the &lsquo;do stuff to

c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">- No save, which is noteworthy. &nbsp;It can throw a wrench in enemy tactics, but isn&rsquo;t very useful against foes that repeat the same thing every round regardless, such as most melee fighting characters and monsters. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a nifty spell to Quicken later on to prevent casters from escaping (or force them to flee, if they recognize the spell via Spellcraft and don&rsquo;t want to risk a round of repetition).</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1 c19">detect thoughts </span><span class="c4 c1">- You get early access to

Eventually becomes obsolete, but at low levels difficult terrain is a massive pain.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1">forbid action - </span><span class="c1">This is an interesting combo with </span><span class="c5 c1">deja vu. &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Hit them with </span><span class="c5 c1">deja vu </span><span class="c4 c1">first, then try to forbid the action they have to repeat; they&rsquo;ll become confused.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1 c10">glue seal </span><span class="c1">- This is the closest you get to </span><span class="c5 c1">grease. &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">It&rsquo;s got a lot of utility in and out of combat. &nbsp;This is also a rare Reflex save spell on your list.</span></li><li class="c2

peril.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1">Hermean potential </span><span class="c4 c1">(LoD) - Consider grabbing this once you&rsquo;ve got some caster levels under your belt. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a nice little defensive buff.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1 c19">ill omen</span><span class="c5 c1 c10">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">- A fine debuff that gets better with age. &nbsp;Avoid using it on casters. &nbsp;No save!</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1 c10">illusion of calm </span><span class="c4 c1">- As long as this spell is up, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about casting defensively.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c16 c1">interrogation </span><span class="c1">- You get </span><span class="c5 c1">detect thoughts </span><span class="c4 c1">as a bonus spell, so you don&rsquo;t need this unless you want to be a bully.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5

class="c4 c1">- This spell can get your friends out of a jam.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1 c10">long arm </span><span class="c4 c1">- This is a must-have for psychics interested in using melee touch spells.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c16 c1">mage armor </span><span class="c4 c1">- You&rsquo;re better off using actual armor. &nbsp;Hooray

metamagic feats such as Toppling Spell. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a decent offensive backup spell.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c16 c1">mind thrust I </span><span class="c1">- The </span><span class="c5 c1">mind thrust </span><span class="c4 c1">line eventually becomes pretty decent, but the lowest-powered version of it is pretty crappy. &nbsp;At high levels when you don&rsquo;t care about your 1st level slots, it&rsquo;s an okay way to inflict some damage if you don&rsquo;t feel like wasting higher level slots.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span

Similar to </span><span class="c5 c1">hideous laughter </span><span class="c1">or </span><span class="c5 c1">hold person, </span><span class="c4 c1">this spell locks an enemy down. &nbsp;Its main advantage over the other two spells is that the target doesn&rsquo;t get a new save every round, but you must concentrate on it. &nbsp;For an undercast spell this is a decent use of a 2nd level slot.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c17 c5 c1">implant false reading </span><span class="c4 c1">- The latest in the GM / NPC item-fiddly spells, this is for leaving red herrings and misleading &lsquo;clues&rsquo; for the party&rsquo;s investigations. &nbsp;Not terribly useful for a PC to know in any but the most intrigue-laden occult games.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1">inflict pain - </span><span class="c1">In the same tier as </span><span class="c5 c1">hold person </span><span class="c4 c1">etc., this spell is a save-or-suck rather than a save-or-lose, but still has an effect on a successful save. </span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1">instigate psychic duel</span><span class="c17 c5 c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">- The psychic duel system is a bit clunky and potentially wasteful of your daily resources. &nbsp;This does have some interesting potential use if you get creative with it. &nbsp;Fighting someone in a public area unbeknownst to anyone else is certainly useful, but it can also be of use in a more traditional dungeon environment. &nbsp;Your opponent is just as defenseless in the real world as you are; if you&rsquo;re fighting a lone enemy, your allies can gang up on the nigh-helpless target while you just focus on defenses. &nbsp;Most enemies will probably be too confused to understand their offensive options in a duel to begin with.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1">investigative mind - </span><span class="c1">You probably won&rsquo;t have much trouble making Knowledge DCs, but this spell is better than </span><span class="c5 c1">hypercognition </span><span class="c4 c1">for what it does.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">invisibility </span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1 c10">ironskin </span><span class="c1">- Basically a lower-duration </span><span class="c5 c1">barkskin</span><span class="c4 c1">, if you&rsquo;re desirous of boosting your AC this is a pretty good spell.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1">knock </span><span class="c4 c1">- Probably better to wand this once you&rsquo;ve got the cash.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1 c10">levitate </span><span class="c4 c1">- Flavorful, and good defense and utility.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c16 c1">mental barrier I </span><span class="c1">- The first of the immediate action defensive undercast spells, they all suffer from a similar problem: casting defensive buffs in advance of a combat scenario is 90% of the time a better use of your resources. &nbsp;They&rsquo;re okay if you get ambushed a lot, but then you&rsquo;ve probably got bigger problems. &nbsp;This takes up the same slot as an extended </span><span class="c5 c1">shield</span><span class="c1">, which will last much longer. &nbsp;By the time you don&rsquo;t care about your 2nd level slots as much, enemies probably won&rsquo;t be throwing around </span><span class="c5 c1">mind thrust I </span><span class="c1">and </span><span class="c5 c1">II </span><span class="c4 c1">anymore.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1">mental block </span><span class="c1">- In the same tier as </span><span class="c5 c1">hold person </span><span class="c1">and other single-target Will save spells. &nbsp;This one </span><span class="c5 c1">sucks </span><span class="c4 c1">for the target if it gets through, basically reducing any PC to an NPC class or worse for the duration.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c17 c5 c1">mind over matter </span><span class="c1">(OO) - This spell is probably of most use for &lsquo;healing&rsquo; purposes on yourself or your allies. &nbsp;Potentially handy in certain situations, but I&rsquo;d rather rely on a wand of </span><span class="c5 c1">lesser restoration. &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Not a bad potion to have in a pinch, though.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c16 c1">mind thrust II </span><span class="c4 c1">- You&rsquo;re dealing on average +1 damage per die. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d rather cast the 1st level version for the trouble&hellip;</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c16 c1">mindshock </span><span class="c1">(OO) - This spell isn&rsquo;t for most psychics. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re multiclassing in some sort of melee build or gestalt, this spell is merely </span><span class="c26 c11 c17 c25 c1">okay.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">minor image</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1 c19">mirror image </span><span class="c4 c1">- Arguably your best defensive spell for a long, long time.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c17 c5 c1">object reading </span><span class="c4 c1">- Best leave this for the Occultist. &nbsp;Fun for flavor, though.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1 c10">oneiric horror </span><span class="c1">- This spell has an edge on </span><span class="c5 c1">hideous laughter, hold person, </span><span class="c4 c1">and its cousins in that the target is fatigued afterward, basically a save-or-lose-then-suck. &nbsp;</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1">pain strike</span><span class="c5 c1 c10">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">- Another decent choice for a Fort. save spell at this level, the main benefit is the sickened effect; everything else is gravy. &nbsp;WARNING: Evil!</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1">paranoia </span><span class="c4 c1">- Yet another Will save-or-suck/lose. &nbsp;So many choices! &nbsp;No additional saves to end this one, but it&rsquo;s less useful against a singular target.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1">piercing shriek </span><span class="c4 c1">- Another Fort. save option, staggered is a crappy condition.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1">pilfering hand </span><span class="c1">- Essentially a lower-powered, more limited </span><span class="c5 c1">telekinesis, </span><span class="c4 c1">this spell is great for snatching up the MacGuffin. </span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1 c19">placebo effect </span><span class="c4 c1">- No emotional components! &nbsp;This is a great &lsquo;fake cleric&rsquo; spell.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1">psychic leech </span><span class="c4 c1">(OO) - Works on a failed save, which is nice. &nbsp;Fatigued isn&rsquo;t the worst condition, although it&rsquo;s a pain for barbarians. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s better on a multiclass or gestalt build that can take advantage of the boost to physical stats. &nbsp;No emotion components, interestingly.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c16 c1">psychonaut manifestation </span><span class="c16 c1">(OO) </span><span class="c4 c1">- Essentially a short duration random mutagen that punishes you for trying to change the bonus/penalty. &nbsp;You don&rsquo;t want this kind of randomness, even if it&rsquo;s thematically appropriate for psychedlia discipline psychics.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1 c10">pyrotechnics </span><span class="c4 c1">- A rare big-and-flashy spell, and a good one at that. &nbsp;Potentially SR: no, and can target different saves.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1 c19">resist energy </span><span class="c4 c1">- A bit boring, but this spell saves lives.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1 c10">rope trick </span><span class="c4 c1">- Consider getting this on a spell lattice / page of spell knowledge.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8 c5 c1">scare</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1 c19">see invisibility </span><span class="c1">- In the absence of </span><span class="c5 c1">glitterdust</span><span class="c4 c1">, this spell is even more vital.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8 c5 c1">shatter</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1 c19">silence </span><span class="c4 c1">- With no verbal components to worry about, this spell becomes a sick-nasty ace up your sleeve. &nbsp;Shut down enemy divine and arcane casters, improve stealth, defend against sonic or language-dependent effects&hellip; This just might be your best 2nd level spell.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1">sonic scream - </span><span class="c1">This odd spell is a rare Ref. save area-of-effect damage spell. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s not much better than </span><span class="c5 c1">burning hands</span><span class="c4 c1">, but it&rsquo;s an option to be aware of.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1 c10">speak with animals </span><span class="c4 c1">- Most of your telepathic abilities don&rsquo;t work on animals, but this spell enables you to communicate with them; surprisingly useful if you think outside the box.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1 c19">spectral hand </span><span class="c4 c1">- This is blue for psychics interested in using touch attack spells, of which there are several decent options. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s the safest way to deliver touch spells (barring metamagic or other means) for a good chunk of your career. &nbsp;Everybody else can skip this.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1 c10">spider climb</span><span class="c5 c1">&nbsp;- </span><span class="c1">There are lots of scenarios where this is preferable to </span><span class="c5 c1">levitate</span><span class="c4 c1">.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1">spontaneous immolation - </span><span class="c4 c1">A rare elemental damage spell. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s not the greatest, but it might be handy to know at least one fire spell.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8 c5 c1">suggestion</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8 c5 c1">summon monster II</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1">thought shield I - </span><span class="c4 c1">The first iteration of this undercast spell is actually pretty handy to have as backup, especially at higher levels when your 2nd level slots are less valuable. &nbsp;Mind-affecting things are bad news.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1">twilight haze - </span><span class="c1">The duration is much worse, but this is another substitute for </span><span class="c5 c1">fog cloud </span><span class="c1">and similar magic.</span></li></ul><p class="c3"><span class="c9 c6"></span></p><a

what&rsquo;s the point?</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1">babble - </span><span class="c4 c1">Another Will save-or-lose, the target doesn&rsquo;t get additional saves, which is

class="c5 c16 c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">- Situations where this would be useful are exceedingly rare; this combines interestingly with </span><span class="c5 c1">shrink item</span><span

I&rsquo;d only suggest taking it as a bonus spell known from the human favored class bonus (or something similar). &nbsp;In a very occult-y game, where the threat of dream manipulation is more pronounced, this is a useful form of defense.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1">ectoplasmic snare - </span><span class="c1">Similar to </span><span class="c5 c1">chain of

Fort., and makes the caster sickened, which is the primary benefit. &nbsp;Warning: Evil!</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1 c10">emotive block </span><span class="c4 c1">- Share the burden of emotion components with this little spell! &nbsp;Best combined with another teammate with a wicked Intimidate modifier, this can cause no end of trouble for enemy spell casters. &nbsp;Also great if you like fear or emotion-based spells yourself.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1">excruciating deformation - </span><span class="c4 c1">Another Fort. save

class="c5 c1">bad news</span><span class="c1">. &nbsp;In an occult game featuring lots of psychic magic being thrown around, there&rsquo;s a good chance you might end up in an imaginary location of an enemy&rsquo;s devising, whether it be a psychic duel or something more insidious. &nbsp;When that happens, this spell is one of the only ways out. &nbsp;You can also use it to rescue your friends. &nbsp;Basically, the closer your game resembles </span><span class="c5 c1">Inception</span><span class="c4 c1">, the more valuable this spell is. &nbsp;</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c17 c5 c1">node of blasting </span><span class="c1">- This spell is a bit too niche for most spontaneous casters to take, but it certainly can be of some use to the creative; just read

class="c17 c5 c1">purge spirit </span><span class="c1">- I&rsquo;m a bit unclear on this spell. &nbsp;It looks like RAI it&rsquo;s only supposed to work on ghosts, mediums, etc. &nbsp;If so, it&rsquo;s too specific. &nbsp;If not, it&rsquo;s comparable to </span><span class="c5 c1">mind thrust </span><span class="c4 c1">at this level.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5

doubling the enemy&rsquo;s chance of negating the spell (or at least reducing its effect). &nbsp;This is also a risky spell if your game features lots of enemy spellcasters throwing around Spellcraft checks to ID spells as they&rsquo;re cast.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1">share senses - </span><span class="c1">I just wanted to point out it&rsquo;s weird psychics get

</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1 c10">create mindscape </span><span class="c4 c1">- Mindscapes haven&rsquo;t become truly scary just yet, but this spell is a potent tool for the creative. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s best used on non-casters: distracting guards, isolating lone enemies, or even just holding private conversations. &nbsp;You may need your companions to lug your useless body around in the meantime, however. &nbsp;Note that you don&rsquo;t need line of sight or effect.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1">crushing despair - </span><span

</span><span class="c4 c1">(OO) - This is a fun little spell, but niche. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;d actually like to escape, you&rsquo;re better off teleporting. &nbsp;Ideally this spell puts your enemies off their guard, allowing you to eavesdrop or attack with surprise to finish them off. &nbsp;</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1 c19">freedom of movement </span><span class="c4

</span><span class="c1">basically obsolete. &nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">Confusion </span><span class="c1">has better range, can affect numerous targets, and doesn&rsquo;t require concentration.

are a pain.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c16 c1">greater oneiric horror </span><span class="c4 c1">- This spell hasn&rsquo;t aged particularly well. &nbsp;There are better options.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1">out of sight </span><span class="c1">(OO) - For most stealth tasks, </span><span class="c5 c1">invisibility </span><span class="c4 c1">will serve you better. &nbsp;This is an interesting option combined with a disguise, though; you could interact with guards or other people, then have a decent chance of them forgetting the whole interaction. &nbsp;A fun bonus spell to pick up for spies or sneaks.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1">phantasmal killer - </span><span class="c4 c1">This is your first true save-or-die. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s hard to get through, but if you&rsquo;ve got your DCs pumped this can certainly be unpleasant. &nbsp;Best combined with other debuffs as a finisher.</span></li><li

c1">planar binding </span><span class="c1">line. &nbsp;Neither of these spells are especially attractive to a spontaneous caster with limited spells known, but if you are interested in calling outsiders (it&rsquo;s certainly a potent tool!), the </span><span class="c5 c1">planar ally </span><span class="c1">line is safer. &nbsp;Yes, it costs money, but you don&rsquo;t get native access to the </span><span class="c5 c1">magic circle </span><span class="c1">spells, which makes </span><span class="c5 c1">planar binding </span><span class="c4 c1">a huge liability. </span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1">rainbow pattern </span><span class="c4 c1">- There are stronger AoE spells this level, but this is worth noting if you&rsquo;ve invested in Spell Focus (illusion).</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1">resilient sphere - </span><span class="c4 c1">Hey, a Ref. save spell! &nbsp;It&rsquo;s okay!</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1">riding possession - </span><span class="c1">Things are getting spooky. &nbsp;Like all possession spells, you need to work carefully with an ally to safeguard your body. &nbsp;Otherwise, this is great for spying, scouting, and messing with people. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re just interested in scouting, </span><span class="c5 c1">arcane eye </span><span class="c4

</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1 c10">lesser simulacrum </span><span class="c1">- You can get up to some terrifying things with this spell. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s hard to justify taking as a spontaneous caster, but it&rsquo;s the closest you&rsquo;ll get to </span><span class="c5 c1">animate dead </span><span class="c4 c1">for a long time. &nbsp;You have enough enchantment abilities to exercise pretty fine control over it, and it&rsquo;s considerably cheaper than its more powerful version. &nbsp;Consider taking as a human favored class bonus spell if you&rsquo;ve got a slower campaign pacing with plenty of downtime, otherwise skip it.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1 c10">spell immunity </span><span class="c1">- A strong defensive buff for the informed adventurer. &nbsp;Good choices at this level include </span><span class="c5 c1">confusion, enervation, </span><span class="c1">and </span><span class="c5 c1">charm monster. &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Less useful if you&rsquo;re not regularly going up against spell casters.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1 c10">stoneskin </span><span class="c4 c1">- It&rsquo;s a bit expensive, but this buff saves lives. &nbsp;You might want to wait until the communal version next level, as it&rsquo;s a better deal.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">summon monster IV</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c16 c1">synaptic scramble </span><span class="c1">- Inferior to </span><span class="c20 c11 c5 c1">confusion.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1">telekinesis - </span><span class="c4 c1">Nice and versatile, and pretty iconic for a psychic. &nbsp;Early access!</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1">telekinetic charge - </span><span class="c4 c1">A bit expensive for a 4th level slot, but your heavily buffed meatshield friend is the worst kind of projectile.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1">telepathic bond - </span><span class="c4 c1">Eventually you&rsquo;ll have native telepathy, but this is nice for long-distance communication.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1 c10">thought shield III </span><span class="c1">- This is almost like an early-access </span><span class="c5

c16 c1">unbearable brightness </span><span class="c1">- This is kind of a crappy spell, but I just wanted to point out that you don&rsquo;t have a lot of ways to deal with magical darkness. &nbsp;This spell, and </span><span class="c5 c1">eyes of the void </span><span class="c4 c1">are two options, both 4th level spells for you. &nbsp;Otherwise, you might have to resort to dispelling. </span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1 c10">wall of blindness/deafness </span><span class="c4 c1">- Another decent Fort. save option this level, with some battlefield

class="c5 c1">phantom limb </span><span class="c4 c1">(OO) - This spell gives you some nice and versatile options in a single package. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s most useful if you have an ally that relies on natural attacks; you can give them two extra claw attacks with this spell, increasing their offensive output significantly. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s also a great long duration spell for flight.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c16 c1">primal regression </span><span class="c4 c1">- This would be an okay spell to simultaneously buff and debuff some dupes you planned on subsequently

enemy casters identifying it is a significant risk, though. &nbsp;It has been noted that this spell couples extremely well with Spell Perfection: a free Persistent Spell coupled with this is particularly potent, and helps reduce the pain of two saving throws in a row.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1">subjective reality </span><span class="c1">(OO) - This spell is extremely strange, but has interesting potential. &nbsp;Against a creature, this makes you effectively incorporeal, but you cannot harm them in turn; decent for a party buffer or summoner. &nbsp;Note, however, that the spell can be cast on an object or force, allowing you to &lsquo;disbelieve&rsquo; something like a wall or pool of lava, allowing you to pass through it effortlessly. &nbsp;Nonmagical hazards can&rsquo;t harm you for the duration, while something like a </span><span class="c5 c1">wall of fire </span><span class="c1">would only deal half damage. &nbsp;Can you choose to disbelieve gravity with this spell? &nbsp;While interesting, you can emulate a lot of what this does with lower level spells like </span><span class="c5 c1">dimension door, </span><span class="c4

&lsquo;third&rsquo; type of magic, psychic magic has some strange eccentricities. &nbsp;Barring further FAQ&rsquo;s and errata, some of these things might have to be adjudicated by GMs on the fly. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12 c6 c1">Emotion and Thought Components: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of somatic components, psychic spells have emotion components, and instead of verbal components, they have thought components.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">PROS: &nbsp;You can cast in armor unimpeded, with your hands full, or even while paralyzed or bound. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s silent, stealthy, and subtle. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">CONS: &nbsp;Thought components increase any concentration DCs by +10! &nbsp;This can be negated by taking a move action to &lsquo;center&rsquo; yourself, so thought components are not particularly difficult to overcome. &nbsp;You can&rsquo;t use emotion components if you are under the effect of a negative emotional status, including any kind of fear. &nbsp;This means as soon as you are shaken, you can&rsquo;t cast a large majority of spells.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">Emotion components are thus the one you have to worry about the most. &nbsp;Occult games seem to be on the creepy side, so fear is going to be a constant threat. &nbsp;Worse, the simple Intimidate skill can shut you down, and there&rsquo;s very little you can do about it. &nbsp;Thus, it pays to be prepared:</span></p><ul class="c18 lst-kix_b0il36n0tnef-0 start"><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">potions of </span><span class="c5 c1">remove fear - </span><span class="c4 c1">50 gp a pop, suppresses fear for 10 mins., more than enough time to resolve a problem.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Logical Spell - This +1 metamagic feat removes an emotion component. &nbsp;Full-round action to cast, but as soon as you have 2nd level slots you can fire off a </span><span class="c5 c1">logical remove fear </span><span class="c4 c1">and be on your way. &nbsp;</span></li><li class="c2

li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c1">Discipline powers - The abomination, pain, and tranquility disciplines come with fear immunity (or in pain&rsquo;s case, paladin mercies).</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">wands of </span><span class="c5 c1">remove fear </span><span class="c4 c1">- Nothing&rsquo;s stopping you from using spell-trigger items while shaken, and wands are

class="c1">Logical </span><span class="c5 c1">metamagic rod </span><span class="c4 c1">(OA) - If you don&rsquo;t want to blow a feat, you can burn gold instead. &nbsp;Certainly handy rods to have when the chips are down.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1">ring of delayed doom </span><span class="c4 c1">(UE) - Expensive, but buys you precious time.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1">rod of steadfast resolve </span><span class="c4 c1">(UE) - In the absence of a paladin, this is a passable substitute, and applies to emotion-effects as well as fear.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1">rod of absorption - </span><span class="c4 c1">A late game acquisition, this item is a potent defensive and offensive tool.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1">cap of the free thinker </span><span class="c4 c1">(UE) - Roll twice on all mind-affecting Will saves. &nbsp;Not unreasonably priced, either.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1">headband of unshakeable resolve </span><span class="c4 c1">(UE) - Another nice fear defense, this takes up the headband slot and thus is competing for your headband of vast intelligence / mental prowess. &nbsp;Only take it if you can add ability enhancing effects to it using Unchained variant rules or something similar.</span></li></ul><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">Basically, a psychic caster has to worry about negative emotions in much the same way that a regular caster has to worry about things like grappling, etc. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s not an impossible obstacle, but it&rsquo;s the price you pay for the other advantages of psychic magic. &nbsp;Intimidate tactics are perhaps the most difficult thing to defend against, and characters up against psychics are well advised to try to use the Intimidate skill. &nbsp;Fortunately, barring experienced anti-psychic hunters, Intimidate tactics seem relatively rare in most pre-made adventures. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12 c6 c1">Expensive Material Components</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">Psychic spells don&rsquo;t have material components, except for expensive ones. &nbsp;Interestingly, you can substitute items of equal or greater worth as long as they have some sort of personal significance to your character. &nbsp;This can let you potentially liquidate treasure in a pinch, especially if obtaining an item is associated with a struggle or challenge.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12 c6 c1">Mythic Adventures and Psychic Magic</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c12 c6 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">Fun fact: currently by the RAW, psychics can&rsquo;t benefit from many options in Mythic Adventures. &nbsp;The Archmage arcana and Hierophant&rsquo;s divine surge specifically only work with arcane or divine spells. &nbsp;Mythic spells still work the same, but you&rsquo;ll lose access to several of the main caster archetypes&rsquo; powers as a psychic caster. &nbsp;Hopefully there will be a psychic-friendly mythic archetype in an expansion soon. &nbsp;In the meantime, you can probably get by with a Trickster or Marshal archetype and substitute several archetype abilities with mythic feats.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12 c6 c1">Words of Power and Psychic Magic</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">There is no list of effect words for psychic magic, and it is unlikely there ever will be. &nbsp;As something of a scholar on words of power, I may devise my own suggested list of spells; that said, words of power is best in the hands of a blaster such as a sorcerer, so it&rsquo;s probably best avoided regardless.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c9 c6">Occult Skill Unlocks</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">Any occult character can use occult skill unlocks with select skills. &nbsp;These are largely flavorful, adding to the creepy atmosphere of an occult game. &nbsp;Unless otherwise noted, you can attempt an occult skill unlock once per day.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12 c6 c1">Automatic Writing (Linguistics) </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c12 c6 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">Once per week, you can attempt a Linguistics check to scribble strange words that may have significance pertaining to your future. &nbsp;For half of your career, this equates to a 1/week </span><span class="c5 c1">augury </span><span class="c1">spell; from level 10 onward, it&rsquo;s a 1/week </span><span class="c5 c1">divination. &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Pretty handy if you&rsquo;ve got the time, and you don&rsquo;t really lose much by trying and failing. &nbsp;Lore discipline psychics will be better at this than everyone else.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12 c6 c1">Dowsing (Survival)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">Psychics are unlikely to use this unlock, since Survival isn&rsquo;t a class skill. &nbsp;This is basically a 1/day </span><span class="c5 c1">locate object </span><span class="c4 c1">spell with more restrictions on what it points you towards. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12 c6 c1">Faith Healing (Heal)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c12 c6 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">The main problem with faith healing is that it is very time consuming, and usually only suppresses afflictions. &nbsp;Heal isn&rsquo;t a psychic class skill, so this is unlikely to see use from them.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12 c6 c1">Hypnotism (Diplomacy)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">While this is largely the Mesmerist&rsquo;s schtick, you can still do well at hypnosis. &nbsp;The DCs are pretty high, but implanting suggestions is a cool trick. &nbsp;Recalling forgotten knowledge is a little more niche, but still potentially handy in a puzzle scenario.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12 c6 c1">Phrenology (Knowledge [Arcana])</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c12 c6 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">A psychic is likely to be pretty good at this. &nbsp;Spells can tell you most of the information available, but the higher DC checks can potentially reveal interesting or useful facts, especially to a necromancer (how many HD did this dead dragon have?). &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12 c6 c1">Prognostication (Sense Motive)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c12 c6 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">Old-timey fortune telling essentially. &nbsp;The high DC checks can provide information similar to automatic writing pertaining to a specific creature, but magic provides most of the other information more quickly and efficiently.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6 c1 c12"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12 c6 c1">Psychometry (Appraise)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">Reading objects has a much lower DC than most other occult skill unlocks, which makes it accessible even to those without Appraise as a class skill (such as psychics). &nbsp;However, there is the chance of being deceived, not only from a failed skill check but also by the various &lsquo;fiddly item spells&rsquo; in Occult Adventures, so take whatever knowledge you gain from psychometry with a grain of salt.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c12 c6 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12 c6 c1">Read Aura (Perception)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c12 c6 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">Of all the occult skill unlocks, this one might be the least useful. &nbsp;The main problem is that it takes 10 minutes of concentration, so there&rsquo;s no guarantee the subject won&rsquo;t wander away. &nbsp;Very basic spells reveal most information this can provide for you.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c9 c6">Psychic Duels</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">Two minds grappling for dominance using pure thought and imagination as weapons&hellip; The concept of the psychic duel is a staple of fantastic psychic power. &nbsp;Occult Adventures introduced the psychic duel subsystem, perhaps as an homage to the attack and defense modes of old. &nbsp;You will only see these rules pop up in two situations: when somebody successfully uses the </span><span class="c5 c1">instigate psychic duel </span><span class="c4 c1">spell, or when a high level psychic duelist (psychic archetype) uses the Thought Made Real class feature.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">In a psychic duel, movement and positioning doesn&rsquo;t matter, and most skills also don&rsquo;t matter; you can&rsquo;t hide from your opponent on a binary mindscape. &nbsp;There are only six ways to exit a psychic duel:</span></p><ol class="c18 lst-kix_jbw5dugs5bp9-0

c6 c1">Creating and Spending Manifestation Points</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c12 c6 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">Actions in a psychic duel are governed by the generation and expenditure of manifestation points, or MP. &nbsp;You can only spend a number of MP on a single manifestation up to your highest spell level, or &frac14; your HD for non-casters. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">There are basically two ways to create MP: spend class resources (spell slots, grit points, etc.), or withdraw from a pool calculated by your HD and mental ability scores. &nbsp;Spending class resources is often inefficient, but it&rsquo;s the safest way to generate MP. &nbsp;Drawing from your ability score/HD pool has long-lasting repercussions after the duel. &nbsp;If you take </span><span class="c5 c1">any points </span><span class="c1">from the HD/ability score pool, you&rsquo;re fatigued for 24 hours. &nbsp;Spend over half, and you&rsquo;re exhausted. &nbsp;Spend them all and you fall unconscious. &nbsp;There is no way to recover from this aside from </span><span class="c5 c1">miracle </span><span class="c1">or </span><span class="c20 c11 c5 c1">wish.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c11 c5 c1 c20"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">Your enemies can afford to use their HD/ability score pool more than you: they&rsquo;re likely in a life-or-death situation. &nbsp;You will have to deal with the 24 hour fatigue or exhaustion for the rest of the day, meaning you&rsquo;re almost always better off using spell slots.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c20 c11 c5 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">Because of this, there is a pecking order of threats for most psychic duels:</span></p><ol class="c18 lst-kix_2u2endlki5qq-0 start" start="1"><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c1">Full casters (1-9 spell levels): &nbsp;Full casters have the most spell slots to burn, and will have an edge on max MP they can spend.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c1">&#8532; casters (1-6 spell levels): &nbsp;They don&rsquo;t have the endurance of full casters, but they&rsquo;ll have an MP expenditure advantage on equal HD non-casters.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c1">&frac12; casters (1-4 spell levels): &nbsp;Characters like rangers, paladins, and bloodragers will have an edge on non-casters until level 20.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c1">Non-casters: &nbsp;Everyone else will have a limited max MP expenditure cap, and often no choice but to use their HD/ability score MP pool, risking fatigue or worse after the duel. </span></li></ol><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">There are two categories of creatures that break this rough hierarchy:</span></p><ol class="c18 lst-kix_z8hz9x126lmb-0 start" start="1"><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c1">Creatures with lots of spell-like abilities: &nbsp;Powerful outsiders, fey, dragons, and other magical creatures can use their SLA&rsquo;s to create MP, giving them better endurance and options than non-magical creatures and casters.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c1">Ultra high HD creatures: The oldest dragons, kaiju, Cthulhu, etc., have far more than 20 HD. &nbsp;Cthulhu has 36 HD, for instance, giving him the same MP cap as 9th level spells, and it will take him a while to burn through his MP.</span></li></ol><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">It&rsquo;s safest to duel non-casters, growing increasingly risky as you go up the chain. &nbsp;Big scary monsters and outsiders are something of a wildcard, and quite risky to engage.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">As you can see, fighting a psychic duel quickly becomes quite costly. &nbsp;You can generate MP from multiple sources, but after a few rounds you&rsquo;ll likely be tapped of limited class features like phrenic pool, arcane pool, </span><span class="c5 c1">ki </span><span class="c4 c1">points, etc. &nbsp;The key to winning a psychic duel is thus to manage your MP.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1 c19">Thought-Form Creatures: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Creating a thought-form creature is the best use of your MP for offense and defense. &nbsp;You spend a certain amount of MP creating it, and afterwards you can keep attacking with it without spending more MP. &nbsp;The more MP you spend improving your creature, the more damage you risk taking should it be destroyed, but in the meantime your creature tanks enemy thought-form creatures automatically. &nbsp;Your priorities for improving your thought-form creature are as follows:</span></p><ol class="c18 lst-kix_vqtrb07iyfqa-0 start" start="1"><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c1">Creature defenses: &nbsp;You want your creature to tank for you. &nbsp;It needs to be the wall upon which your opponent&rsquo;s attacks break, thus causing him to waste MP. &nbsp;This buys your allies more time to take out a target in the real world if you aren&rsquo;t alone. &nbsp;Increase AC and HP first, then consider boosting saving throws.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c1">Protective Ability: &nbsp;for a modest cost, your creature improves your defenses against offensive manifestations. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s yet another incentive to attack your creature instead of you. &nbsp;This forces your opponent to either waste MP with direct attacks, or create a creature of their own.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c1">Extra Attacks: &nbsp;Every time your creature attacks saves you MP and potentially forces your opponent to waste MP on defenses. &nbsp;It is the most efficient use of MP offensively (especially for arcane, divine, and non-casters), particularly if you&rsquo;re trying to win the duel fair and square.</span></li></ol><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c16 c1">Offensive Manifestations:</span><span class="c17 c6 c1">&nbsp; </span><span class="c4 c1">Directly attacking your foe or any thought-form creatures is extremely costly. &nbsp;For psychic casters, it can possibly be worth it in an attempt to knock-out a weakened opponent quickly. &nbsp;Arcane casters can try it in desperation, but divine and non-casters have a horrid cost-to-damage ratio (d4 damage instead of d8 or d6 respectively). &nbsp;Attempting to inflict negative statuses is quite costly, and most only last 1 round. &nbsp;The entangled and shaken conditions are not too expensive and last longer than 1 round, making them potentially worth it. &nbsp;If you spend any MP on negative statuses or anything other than a flat attack roll delivery (touch attack, saving throw, etc.), your attack will start to fall behind on maximum damage a great deal. &nbsp;Thought-form creatures are always more efficient!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Defensive Manifestations: &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Though likely cheaper than offensive manifestations overall, using a defensive manifestation every round quickly grows costly. &nbsp;Never use </span><span class="c16 c1">disruptive counter </span><span class="c1">if you have a thought-form creature out (which you should), since it dismisses your creature. &nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c10">Psychic redirect </span><span class="c4 c1">is often your best bet; shunt attacks onto your creature and let it tank for you. &nbsp;The rest of the defenses should be used on a case-by-case basis depending on how the duel is going. &nbsp;Ideally your creature absorbs all the punishment, saving you MP.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">How to win a psychic duel: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">If you&rsquo;re dueling a weak opponent with low hp, you might be able to overwhelm him quickly with an all-out attack. &nbsp;In most situations, though, you want to do two things: waste your opponent&rsquo;s resources, and waste your opponent&rsquo;s time.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">Spend the first round of every duel building the tankiest, turtle-iest thought-form creature you can. &nbsp;Then sit behind it and wait. &nbsp;Your opponent will either waste MP trying to directly attack you (which you can re-direct to your creature), or make a creature of their own. &nbsp;The duel then becomes a Pokemon match. &nbsp;Every round, your creature gets to attack, but this is secondary to weathering your opponent&rsquo;s attacks.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">If your goal is to win an actual duel, it becomes a battle of attrition. &nbsp;Once your opponent is low on MP sources, you&rsquo;ll have them at your mercy. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">If you&rsquo;ve trapped your opponent in a battle with allies in the real world, your objective is a holding action. &nbsp;Keep your opponent in the duel, weather their attacks, and buy your allies time to beat their useless meat-body up in the real world.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9 c6"></span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c9 c6">Familiars, Possession, Mindscapes, and You</span></p><p class="c22 c23"><span class="c9 c6"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">Familiars are useful for all sorts of reasons, and it isn&rsquo;t too hard for a psychic to acquire one (feats, VMC, etc.). &nbsp;The various possession spells can be quite useful, as can </span><span class="c5 c1">instigate psychic duel </span><span class="c1">and </span><span class="c5 c1">create mindscape</span><span class="c4 c1">. &nbsp;These spells leave your physical body quite vulnerable, so it&rsquo;s best to leave your meat-sack in the care of your allies. &nbsp;Should you find yourself alone, however, your familiar can serve as your best defense. &nbsp;Through your familiar&rsquo;s empathic link, you&rsquo;ll have a good warning system should your body become endangered, allowing you to end a possession or similar spell and get back to your body.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c9 c6">Multiclassing</span></p><p class="c22 c23"><span class="c9 c6"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">As a full caster, it&rsquo;s generally advised to stick with your class and focus on gaining more magical power. &nbsp;However, there are a few considerations for the curious:</span></p><ul class="c18 lst-kix_8ke0z0h3krzv-0 start"><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c1">Paladin dip: &nbsp;A more martial psychic would benefit from a 3 level foray into paladin. &nbsp;You gain heavy armor proficiency, CHA to saves, and most importantly immunity to fear. &nbsp;Couples well with the faith discipline thematically.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c1">Loremaster: &nbsp;This prestige class doesn&rsquo;t specify arcane or divine magic, you just need to know seven divinations. &nbsp;A lore discipline psychic could have fun here. &nbsp;You don&rsquo;t lose a whole lot from this PRC in the grand scheme of things, especially if the game isn&rsquo;t likely to reach level 20. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll possibly miss major phrenic amps and your final discipline ability in exchange for some defensive boosts, a bonus feat, or extra bonus spells.</span></li></ul><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">Half-elves are good here, as is the Magical Knack trait. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll list more potential combos as I learn more.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c9 c6">Variant Multiclassing</span></p><p class="c22 c23"><span class="c9 c6"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">Introduced in Pathfinder Unchained, the VMC system is potentially more attractive to psychics; you don&rsquo;t lose out on spellcasting and class features, but you pay the cost of half (!) your feats. &nbsp;Note that you lose your 19th level feat, locking you out of Expanded Arcana for another 9th level spell.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c12 c6 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12 c6 c1">VMC Alchemist</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c12 c6 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">Thematically appropriate for a psychedelia discipline psychic, the addition of bombs is a nice offensive option for the lacking-in-explosions psychic. &nbsp;The 15th level poison use abilities are something of a waste unfortunately. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12 c6 c1">VMC Oracle</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c12 c6 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">Curses can give you access to bonus spells or other benefits at the cost of an inconvenience of some kind. &nbsp;Note you can nab heavy armor proficiency from the Battle mystery, healing from the Life mystery&hellip; &nbsp;There&rsquo;s lots of goodies here. &nbsp;Combos well with the faith discipline. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c12 c6 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12 c6 c1">VMC Sorcerer</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">Consider the Arcane bloodline. &nbsp;You get a familiar (or bonded item), the metamagic adept ability, a bonus spell known, a bonus feat, and +2 to the save DCs of a single school of magic. &nbsp;You come out about even if you had spent the feats on similar abilities, but you don&rsquo;t have to worry about CHA for the Arcane Heritage feat line.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">The various other bloodlines can give you some pretty decent abilities, and there&rsquo;s usually nice synergy with both classes being spontaneous casters.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12 c6 c1">VMC Witch</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c12 c6 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">The main draw here is access to hexes, and you can get a familiar as well, so there&rsquo;s lots of fun options. &nbsp;Even with the restrictions, the slumber hex is a great help to dream discipline psychics. &nbsp;Extra debuffs, healing&hellip; this is a pretty good choice.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12 c6 c1">VMC Wizard</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c12 c6 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">Another strong choice. &nbsp;Easy access to a familiar, and many of the school powers are quite useful. &nbsp;Divination and Illusion are great, as is Enchantment for a more social psychic. &nbsp;There are several useful arcane discoveries as well, such as Infectious Charms or Time Stutter. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c22 c23"><span class="c9 c6"></span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c9 c6">Psychic Bloodline Sorcerer</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">This new sorcerer bloodline is worth mentioning. &nbsp;The bloodline arcana makes your sorcerer spells count as psychic magic, so you lose traditional spell components in exchange for emotion and thought components. &nbsp;Psychic fireballs! &nbsp;Psychic chain lightning! &nbsp;This is a pretty cool arcana.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">Your bonus spell list includes nearly every undercast spell, which you eventually automatically &lsquo;update&rsquo; for the latest version; technically a psychic sorcerer has more higher level spells known than his peers after level 9. &nbsp;However, the usefulness of these spells rarely rises above a black rating in my opinion, so keep that in mind.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c6 c9">Psychic Detective</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">This investigator archetype swaps out alchemy for psychic casting, drawing from the psychic spell list up to level 6 spells. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re interested in this archetype, you can use the spell ratings above to help guide your selection. &nbsp;This is a pretty neat option for investigators; see if you can convince your GM to let it stack with Empiricist!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><a id="id.vs1eeh9np0jj"></a><p class="c22"><span class="c12 c6 c15">Psi-Tech Discoveries</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">Introduced in </span><span class="c5 c1">Occult Realms, </span><span class="c4 c1">psi-tech discoveries marry psychic magic with advanced technology. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re introducing wacky aliens and robots into your game, why not give them psychic powers instead of regular magic? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">There&rsquo;s nothing stopping a psychic from learning psi-tech discoveries; you don&rsquo;t need to be a special race, or have a specific discipline or archetype; they&rsquo;re up for grabs! &nbsp;Maybe check with your GM first, if they&rsquo;re too futuristic. &nbsp;Really, barring a few exceptions, several of them could just be re-fluffed as new forms of psychic power.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">Importantly, a psychic can learn a psi-tech discovery in place of a phrenic amplification </span><span class="c5 c1">or a feat</span><span class="c4 c1">. &nbsp;So if you&rsquo;re running out of feats to take, maybe learn how to shoot lasers?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">Most of these are only worth taking if your campaign involves technological equipment, otherwise they&rsquo;re dead weight.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c16 c21">Artificial Ascension: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">Error: 404, psi-tech discovery not found.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">Err&hellip; okay, you can only learn this discovery at level 20. &nbsp;You don&rsquo;t get a new phrenic amp at level 20, nor do you gain a new feat at level 20&hellip; so how are you supposed to learn this? &nbsp;Epic levels?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">Even if this wasn&rsquo;t impossible to take, it&rsquo;s&hellip; extremely campaign dependent. &nbsp;You need </span><span class="c5 c1">robots, </span><span class="c4 c1">a specific subset of construct, in order to download your brain. &nbsp;And if your new robot body is destroyed&hellip; you&rsquo;re screwed. &nbsp;Hope you like not having a CON score! &nbsp;You become an AI with this ability, and can keep stealing bigger and better robot bodies, but&hellip; yeah. &nbsp;Moving on.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c16 c21">Disease Transference: &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">What&rsquo;s futuristic about diseases? &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t get it. &nbsp;This ability is terrible, by the way. &nbsp;You can remove a disease from someone, and transfer it to yourself or another person you&rsquo;re touching. &nbsp;However, you need to succeed at a caster level check to do so, equal to the original disease save DC +10! &nbsp;Yikes! &nbsp;You won&rsquo;t stand a chance of doing this with any consistency until you&rsquo;re well into the double digits, and even then it&rsquo;s not guaranteed. &nbsp;Then, assuming this works, the new target has to save against the disease or start suffering the consequences. &nbsp;You could just&hellip; you know&hellip; use the Heal skill? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">But hey! &nbsp;You can cast </span><span class="c5 c1">diagnose disease </span><span class="c4 c1">at-will! &nbsp;Enjoy!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c16 c21">Force Field:</span><span class="c17 c6 c21">&nbsp; </span><span class="c1">This ability starts off okay when you first get it at 3rd level, but it quickly becomes too expensive for what it does. &nbsp;It costs precious phrenic pool points, and doesn&rsquo;t do a much better job than </span><span class="c5 c1">false life</span><span class="c1">. &nbsp;The fast healing ability is kind of neat, but costs 3 phrenic points, which is way too much. &nbsp;Finally, if your shield runs out of temp. hp, you can&rsquo;t use it again for 24 hours. &nbsp;You can cast </span><span class="c5 c1">false life </span><span class="c4 c1">as many times as you want in a day, as long as you&rsquo;ve got the spell slots&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c21">Kinetic Enhancement: &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Okay, this is approximately on the same power level as a feat, so it might be worthy of taking (as a feat, not a phrenic amp). &nbsp;You add your INT mod to CMB and CMD, as well as STR checks to lift or break stuff. &nbsp;Notably, this lets you double your INT bonus to CMB when using spells such as </span><span class="c5 c1">telekinesis, </span><span class="c1">which already substitute your INT for your STR when making combat maneuvers. &nbsp;If you like the </span><span class="c5 c1">telekinesis </span><span class="c4 c1">line spells, this can give you a nice edge. &nbsp;This also doesn&rsquo;t take much re-fluffing, since telekinesis is part of the base game regardless of high technology.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c6 c21">Laser Blast:</span><span class="c6 c21">&nbsp; </span><span class="c4 c1">Direct damage is hard to come by for the psychic, but starting at 11th level you can fire lasers! &nbsp;Pew pew! &nbsp;This ability is powered by your spell slots, so you can burn low level slots that aren&rsquo;t as important to you to use this ability. &nbsp;It does fire damage, which is something of a rarity for you, and it is also a supernatural ability, so it overcomes SR. &nbsp;I wouldn&rsquo;t use higher level slots on it, and it does have a pretty short range, but it&rsquo;s an interesting option if you&rsquo;re looking for something new to do and have all your important feats. &nbsp;Just don&rsquo;t expect to be dishing out mega-damage here. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s something to do when you don&rsquo;t feel like using better spell slots, but still want to participate in a fight.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c6 c21">Mind Over Augmentation:</span><span class="c6 c21">&nbsp; </span><span class="c1">Does your game involve cybertech? &nbsp;Yes? &nbsp;Then this is okay at high levels </span><span class="c5 c1">if </span><span class="c1">you&rsquo;ve got the money and time to augment your meat-chassis. &nbsp;You basically can ignore your CON score and get even more mileage out of your INT score for the purposes of determining your cybertech limit, but it&rsquo;s going to get expensive </span><span class="c5 c1">fast. &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Cybertech is basically slotless magic items that are twice as expensive as their regular counterparts, so you&rsquo;re definitely not saving money in the long run. &nbsp;However, you can&rsquo;t have cybertech stolen, and I </span><span class="c5 c1">think </span><span class="c4 c1">it would still function in an antimagic field (maybe? &nbsp;Sure?). &nbsp;This is going to be mega campaign dependent. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c1">Remember: you gave up a feat for this, so you&rsquo;re not getting your money&rsquo;s worth until you have cybertech installed that surpases the original limit imposed by your CON score.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c6 c21">Psychic Battery: &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Again, this ability is so campaign-dependent that it&rsquo;s almost impossible to rate. &nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c1">If </span><span class="c4 c1">your game involves non-worn technological items, you can use this ability to provide charges, but they&rsquo;re not permanent; you have to use them in one round. &nbsp;It eats up your swift action too. &nbsp;That said, charges are precious, especially if you&rsquo;ve got some sweet charge-powered gear on hand, so this ability helps your tech &lsquo;endurance.&rsquo; &nbsp;It&rsquo;s basically mandatory for Mindtech discipline psychics, as it powers their phrenic pool recovery mechanic. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c6 c21">Radiation Resistance: &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Most games will never see the dangers of radiation, making this useless. &nbsp;But in games that involve radiation, this is worth a feat if you can spare it. &nbsp;It gives you a boost on your Fort.-weak self vs. the dangers of radiation, which are really nasty. &nbsp;Even low-level radiation causes CON </span><span class="c5 c1">drain, </span><span class="c4 c1">so anything that helps you avoid that is good!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c16 c21">Techsmith: &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">All this does is save you time. &nbsp;Time is precious, certainly, but if you&rsquo;re playing in a game that has the downtime, and the </span><span class="c5 c1">facilities, </span><span class="c4 c1">to make tech equipment, you can probably afford to spend the extra days. &nbsp;Save yourself a feat, folks.
