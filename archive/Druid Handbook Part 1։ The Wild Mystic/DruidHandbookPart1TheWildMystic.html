This is part 1 of a 3 part series on the Druid.&nbsp; The Druid is a very complicated class, offering many different class abilities, some amazing, some very minor, and some with fantastically different options which will shape your Druid in massively different ways.</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 318.00px; height: 352.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 318.00px;

It was a more versatile fighter replacement, with an animal companion as a secondary tank, and was a primary caster if he ever got time to cast in between ripping the guts out of the enemy with teeth and claw.&nbsp; It is no wonder that the Druid was considered the most powerful class in core 3.5 D&amp;D, and one of the most powerful in any 3.5 game.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In Pathfinder, as we will discover, the Druid has more options, but simply cannot do it all anymore.&nbsp; A Druid who focuses on casting cannot hold his own in melee combat, even with Wild-shape, and a Druid who focuses on melee combat simply does not have the staying power or the spell DC&#39;s required for filling the role of a primary caster.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>All aspects of the Druid build change depending on this focus, which is why I have created a three part handbook, or perhaps two different handbooks and a spell guide if you prefer.&nbsp; This first part will concentrate on the Druid style I have named, &quot;The Wild Mystic&quot;.&nbsp; The Wild Mystic is </span><span class="c4">not</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;a warrior in any respect.&nbsp; The Wild Mystic has as many spell castings as the party Wizard, with comparable DC&#39;s and Metamagic abilities.&nbsp; A slightly inferior spell list (though probably not as inferior as you may have been led to believe, we will tear that apart too.) is made up for with spell-like abilities that improve maneuverability and defenses, and the inclusion of spontaneous casting, which leads to a more versatile memorization list than most primary casters will have.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Wild Mystic is a powerful caster, worthy of filling a niche outside of melee combat, contributing to the party success through Buffing, Battlefield Control, Blasts and Healing magic.&nbsp; Yes, I did include blasts.&nbsp; The Druid is no better at blasting than a Wizard or Sorcerer, but in order to maintain staying power in combat, the Druid will need to fill some actions with blast spells.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c26 c17 c7 c4"><a class="c14" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid%3D0AcNyxDTKvAmqZGRtZzhzdjZfNDBnM3d6OHRjNg%26hl%3Den&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611517389119000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0SL6yQ4ptlhLWiT7DFk942">Chapter 2: The Spirit of the Beast</a></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c17 c7 c4 c26"><a class="c14" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid%3D0AcNyxDTKvAmqZGRtZzhzdjZfNDlmZ3Y2YjNjdA%26hl%3Den&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611517389120000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1njIfFnnodboBhUR_8hTcp">Chapter 3: Druid spells examined</a></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c4">Colour Coding the Guide:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In this guide I will be Colour Coding your various options to provide opinion on each.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c9 c4">Red:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Warning.&nbsp; This is a poor option and should be avoided.&nbsp; For spells, simply don&#39;t expect to ever memorize these.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Orange</span><span class="c0">: This is an OK option.&nbsp; I&#39;m not recommending it, but it&#39;s not bad.&nbsp; For spells, not an everyday memorization, but in the right circumstance, good to have.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12 c9 c4">Green:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I recommend this option.&nbsp; It is a strong choice.&nbsp; For spells, this is a worthy memorization option.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c10 c4">Blue</span><span class="c0">: A must have.&nbsp; Your best possible option.&nbsp; For spells, this would be a &quot;must have&quot; memorization in my opinion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c4">The Druid Class Abilities:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4">Nature Sense:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;A simple bonus to two class skills.&nbsp; Nature Sense is gained at level 1 and provides an untyped +2 bonus to Knowledge (Nature) and Survival.&nbsp; As we will see later, the former is a very important skill for Druids, so this bonus is welcome.&nbsp; Certainly both skills are very flavor appropriate for the class.&nbsp; Not a flashy power, but as a free bonus, we will gladly take it.&nbsp; To take advantage of this ability we should ensure that both of these skills see ranks put into them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4">Wild Empathy:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;This is basically like getting a skill maxed out for free.&nbsp; Wild Empathy, gained at level 1, is diplomacy for animals.&nbsp; The Druid uses his class level plus his CHA bonus as the base, plus d20 for improving the attitudes of animals.&nbsp; Cha is not going to be a strong ability for your Druid, and there is no &quot;Class Skill&quot; bonus, so you will hardly be Dr. Doolittle.&nbsp; An appropriate skill for the class, and certainly worth a try when confronted with potentially noisy guard dogs, or similar situations.&nbsp; Don&#39;t expect miracles though.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4">Woodland Stride:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;At level 2, this provides the Druid the ability to move through overgrown terrain without hinderment.&nbsp; This is important, as it essentially gives the ability to move through natural difficult terrain without penalty, allows 5&#39; steps and all that good stuff.&nbsp; Personally, I&#39;ve found natural difficult terrain comes up a reasonable amount of times through a campaign, so although this remains circumstantial, you will likely benefit from it a couple times.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4">Trackless Step:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;At 3rd level the Druid leaves no trail and cannot be tracked.&nbsp; This is like a Pass Without Trace spell on all the time.&nbsp; Note that there is no contested roll with the tracker, it&#39;s just total immunity.&nbsp; The 20th level Ranger can&#39;t hope to track the 3rd level Druid.&nbsp; Not going to come up a lot, but worthy to note, if it does, it will work.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4">Resist Nature&#39;s Lure:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;At level 4 this ability gives a +4 bonus to save against the supernatural or spell-like abilities of fey.&nbsp; Yep, sounds just as circumstantial as it is.&nbsp; I think in 80% of campaigns this will never see use.&nbsp; No big deal, it&#39;s a minor ability.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c7">Venom Immunity:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;At 9th level the Druid gets total immunity from poison.&nbsp; Not a bonus to save, total immunity.&nbsp; A Periapt of Proof against poison costs 27,000 gp and takes up a magic item slot.&nbsp; Druids get the ability for free while still in single digit levels.&nbsp; This is a big deal.&nbsp; Also note, the &quot;Use Poison&quot; ability would now be completely redundant to you.&nbsp; Use poison all you want, and if you accidentally poison yourself, who cares?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4">A thousand Faces:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The Druid can change their appearance at will by 13th level as if using the Alter Self spell.&nbsp; Note that we are not talking about the disguise self spell here, Alter Self provides real changes with real bonuses.&nbsp; A 13th level human Druid can simply choose to be in Dwarf form, gaining permanent Darkvision and a +2 Size bonus to Str, or a Gnome to get permanent Low Light vision, small size, and a +2 size bonus to Dex, or switch back and forth, or take another form.&nbsp; This is a good power.&nbsp; Note that you cannot use it in conjunction with Wild-shape.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4">Timeless Body:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;You gain none of the negative effects of aging by 15th level.&nbsp; Aging doesn&#39;t come up in a lot of campaigns, though you can choose to be of different age in some campaigns (Check with your DM.)&nbsp; Specifically the Wild Mystic might benefit from being slightly older, taking some small penalties to physical stats while boosting Wisdom (and CHA and Int), however, note that Timeless body won&#39;t make previous penalties dissapear, it will prevent any new penalties.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c4">Ability Scores</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When we discuss ability scores for the Wild Mystic, we must remember the Wild-shape ability.&nbsp; Go ahead, peek ahead at Wild-shape if you like, as I will discuss these matters again there.&nbsp; First of all, a Wild Mystic will be wild-shaping, even if not entering melee.&nbsp; Better to be a small bird circling overhead raining mystical barrages from above than a squishy little caster hiding behind the fighter right?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Therefore, remember that Wild-shape no longer provides the Dexterity of the creature, so a Wild Mystic cannot ignore his dexterity.&nbsp; Furthermore, as with any caster, Con should not be ignored either.&nbsp; Int is less important, though I don&#39;t recommend a straight Dump as it will gimp your skills, and Cha also is less important, though again, I wouldn&#39;t recommend a full out dump.&nbsp; Str is going to be a full dump stat.&nbsp; Wisdom of course, is primary.&nbsp; Consider Wisdom as primary a stat for the Wild Mystic as you would consider CHA a primary stat for a Sorcerer.&nbsp; Wild Mystics need Wis even more than a Cleric, as a Cleric tends to have more non-casting options, while the Wild Mystic is casting consistently in combat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>So the order of ability priority ends up being: </span><span class="c10 c4">Wis</span><span>, </span><span class="c12 c4">Dex</span><span>, </span><span class="c12 c4">Con</span><span>,</span><span class="c5 c4">&nbsp;Int</span><span>, </span><span class="c5 c4">Cha</span><span>, </span><span class="c6 c4">Str</span><span class="c0">.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If it was my 15 point buy, before Racial Modifiers, my Wild Mystic would have an ability array that looked something like this:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Str</span><span>: 7 (-4), </span><span class="c4">Dex:</span><span>&nbsp;14 (5), </span><span class="c4">Con:</span><span>&nbsp;13 (3), </span><span class="c4">Int:</span><span>&nbsp;10, </span><span class="c4">Cha:</span><span>&nbsp;8 (-2), </span><span class="c4">Wis:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;17 (13)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As you can see, Wisdom is not just the primary stat, it is head and shoulders above the next stat in terms of priority.&nbsp; Although this example is a guideline only, hopefully the point is made that Wisdom doesn&#39;t need to be good, it needs to be great.&nbsp; I think 17 is a very appropriate starting ability score for Wis (before racial modifiers), but if I had more than 15 points, I would consider getting that Con to 14, or that Cha to 10.&nbsp; A 12 Int would be nice too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c8">Race</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are a few general guidelines to discuss before we start getting into the specific examples.&nbsp; First and foremost, we must again consider Wild-shape.&nbsp; One of the things Wild-shape provides is the same base speed as the form taken.&nbsp; Therefore, once Wild-shape and Natural Spell become options, expect to be Wild-shaped into creatures providing either non-standard movement forms (like fly, climb or swim), or land movement speeds significantly higher than the party Monk.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As such, racial disadvantage in regards to land speed becomes less of an issue.&nbsp; Furthermore, Size, which also changes to the form chosen, becomes less of an issue as well.&nbsp; Finally, special senses such as Darkvision or Low light vision are lost from your primary form, and gained from your assumed form, so they become less of a factor as well. &nbsp;So when it comes to Race we are considering the following, likely in this priority sequence:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">1) Does it have a bonus to Wisdom?&nbsp; If not, this might make an OK Wild Mystic, but definitely won&#39;t be tops on your list</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">2) Are the racial abilities going to still work in Wild-shape?&nbsp; If so, will they be of great benefit or simply circumstantial?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Not to say you will be Wild-shaped all the time.&nbsp; At levels 1-3 you can&#39;t, and at level 4 it&#39;s not a really good idea except out of combat for utility.&nbsp; However, at level 5 on, expect to be Wild-shaped quite a bit, even if it&#39;s not all day.&nbsp; By level 10 you may find yourself very rarely in your original form at all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c10 c4">Human:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I think Human is probably the Stellar choice for the Wild Mystic.&nbsp; The flexible stat bonus is put in the one overwhelmingly primary stat, and the bonus feat and skill point that encompass the entire Human benefit package, will serve you just as well in Wild-shape as when you aren&#39;t.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12 c9 c4">Dwarf:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;A very good choice for Wild Mystics.&nbsp; Dwarves are the only race with Set stat modifiers that give a Wisdom bonus.&nbsp; In addition, the 20 foot movement is less of a factor than for most other classes because of Wild-shape.&nbsp; The Con bonus is a good trade for the Cha penalty, and a number of the racial benefits, though circumstantial, will translate to other forms.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Half-Orc:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;A decent choice for Wild Mystics.&nbsp; I would put it behind the Dwarf, but still not bad at all.&nbsp; The flexible stat bonus goes to Wisdom, and the Orc Ferocity works well with healing magic (you fall below 0 HP, then use your standard action to heal yourself).&nbsp; That combination is worthy of special mention.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The others:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;There aren&#39;t any really bad choices for the Wild Mystic, so if another race fits your concept, it&#39;s not a deal-breaker, but the other races bring less to the table than the ones mentioned above.&nbsp; Of the remaining races, I would rank the Half-Elf the highest, again for the Wisdom boost.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c4">Feats</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Being a primary caster who will be spontaneously summoning as well as a Wildshaper, we have a few &quot;must have&quot; feats come to mind right away right?&nbsp; After that, there&#39;s quite a bit of flexibility, but I&#39;ll present a few choice options here:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c4">Spell Focus (Conjuration):</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Not of a lot of use to you as you have very few conjuration spells that require a saving throw, but it&#39;s a prerequisite for Augment Summoning, so it&#39;s a must have</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c4">Augment Summoning:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;This feat improves your summons significantly.&nbsp; A +4 Str bonus isn&#39;t just a damage boost, it&#39;s also a +2 to hit, and that&#39;s on every attack the creature has.&nbsp; The +4 Con is 2 hp/HD.&nbsp; This too makes a significant difference.&nbsp; This is a must have.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c4">Natural Spell:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;This is your level 5 feat.&nbsp; If you could take it at level 4 you would.&nbsp; This feat makes Wild-shape a combat viable ability, well worth a feat slot.&nbsp; It is also the reason you are a better polymorpher than Wizards or Sorcerers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12 c4">Combat Casting:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Sometimes you will need to cast on the defensive, and a +4 is a decent bonus.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12 c4">Improved Initiative:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Always a great feat, especially for a Primary caster.&nbsp; Tactically, initiative is a big deal in this game.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">Spell Penetration:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;A +2 to Caster Level checks to defeat the SR of enemies.&nbsp; You have more non-direct spell options than direct spells, but still a good investment.&nbsp; Not a requirement though, remember, summoned creatures don&#39;t care about SR.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12 c4">Extend Spell:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;A nice metamagic feat to have.&nbsp; You do a lot of long duration buffs, and extending these is often a decent option in the mid level range.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12 c4">Quicken Spell:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Eventually a must, but not until later levels.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12 c4">Toughness:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;+1 HP per level is almost as good as 2 points of Con.&nbsp; Extra HP is always welcome to pretty much any class.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12 c4">Heavy Armor Proficiency:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Later on you will be wearing Ironwood armors.&nbsp; Honesty, getting a &quot;Wild&quot; enchantment on Hide just isn&#39;t worth it.&nbsp; Ironwood Full plate armor is going to be the best armor you can get, and assuming you aren&#39;t wild-shaped all the time, you will find that being proficient is a good choice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c19 c9 c4">Craft Feats:&nbsp; I&#39;ve said my piece on these before, selling off your feat slots for cash.&nbsp; However, if that&#39;s what you want to do, consider:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">Craft Staff:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;A good way to increase your sustainability in combat.&nbsp; CL is brought up with your level, and Staves remain good right through level 20.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">Craft Wondrous Item:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;A very versatile craft feat</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12 c4">Scribe Scroll:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;For Divine Casters, this is quite useful, because in off time you can simply memorize those spells that you would normally not memorize and scribe them.&nbsp; Then the circumstantial spells are still available when you need them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c4 c19">Feats from the Bestiary:&nbsp; Upon GM approval, consider these feats as well...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12 c4">Flyby attack:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;A great way to deliver touch spell effects.&nbsp; Get in, get out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c4">Hover:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;A very nice feat to have, especially when fly maneuverability isn&#39;t that great</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">Improved Natural Armor:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Self explanatory right?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12 c4 c25">Skills</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although you have 4 skill points + Int/level and that might sound pretty good, expect to be feat-starved.&nbsp; The reason is you have a few &quot;must have&quot; skills, so once you have those...well, there just aren&#39;t many points left for the &quot;nice to have&quot; skills.&nbsp; I&#39;m only going to list the blue and green ranked skills, because there is more choices between those than you have skills slots to spend unfortunately.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c4">Knowledge (Nature):</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Firstly, you can only Wild-shape into creatures you know, what creatures you know is defined by this skill, so it is a must-have and a must-max.&nbsp; Secondly, getting the most out of &quot;Nature Sense&quot; involves taking this as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c4">Perception:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Not only is this the most used skill in the game, you are actually probably as good at it (or better) than anyone else because it is based off of Wisdom.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c4">Handle Animal:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;This is a close call between Blue and Green, the ability to teach animals tricks, as well as &quot;push&quot; an animal are part of this skill.&nbsp; This will allow you to have your summoned creatures do more than just blindly attack the enemy (though this will be your normal task for them).&nbsp; If it&#39;s not an absolute must-have, it&#39;s really close.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c22 c4">Survival</span><span class="c0">: Between being a Wisdom based skill and getting a bonus with Nature Sense to this skill, this is something that you will be really good at if you take it.&nbsp; Maxing it out may not be necessary.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c22 c4">Fly:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;You will be doing a lot of flying, and your maneuverability isn&#39;t always going to be all that hot, so this is really an important skill.&nbsp; Not quite a &quot;must-have&quot; (eventually you will probably be using Air Elemental forms for perfect flight), but still a very good choice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c22 c4">Spellcraft:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The importance of this skill depends upon your party makeup.&nbsp; If you can delegate the responsibility for identifying magic items to a party Bard or Wizard, that would be a relief, otherwise, you probably need this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c22">Heal:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Mainly valuable for treating poisons and diseases.&nbsp; You have spell options for this, but often not memorized.</span></p><p class="c1 c16"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c22 c4">Linguistics:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Consider a couple levels to pick up Undercommon and Fey.&nbsp; This will allow you to communicate with a number of creatures on your Summon Natures Ally list.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In addition, some single level dips into some other class skills would probably be helpful.&nbsp; Swim, Climb, and potentially Ride as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4 c21">Favored Class</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;m inclined to think, considering how many feats there are that you want to have, that the extra skill point might be the better choice, though I might mix it up as well.&nbsp; Probably either choice is going to be similarly helpful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c4">Equipment:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Remember in Wild-shape that you cannot speak (and therefore can&#39;t use spell trigger items), and you may or may not be able to hold something like a metamagic rod.&nbsp; Your equipment melds into your form, but equipment that has constant effects continue to function (except for armor), so when purchasing magic items, those with constant effects should be favored.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c4">Wands:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;A great choice, especially at lower levels.&nbsp; First level wands are useful and cheap.&nbsp; Wands of Cure Light Wounds, Magic Fang, Obscuring Mist and Faerie Fire would all be very inexpensive and good options.&nbsp; If you don&#39;t mind spending a bit more, spells like Delay Poison, Sleet Storm, and Lesser Restoration also are great wands.&nbsp; level 5 you will be spending a lot of time wild-shHowever, be aware that after aped, so combat-based wands really are only going to be used when you are running out of spells, as you will need to switch back to your regular form (note that even if you can hold a wand in your wild-shaped form, you cannot activate it, because spell trigger items require speech)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Also worthy of a special note is a wand of Mage Armor.&nbsp; You can&#39;t use it, but odds are someone in your party can, whether through availability on a spell list or UMD.&nbsp; If you buy this wand, you can have them use it on you for a 1 hour +4 Armor bonus.&nbsp; Much cheaper than the &quot;wild&quot; enchantment on your armor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c4">Scrolls:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Look down at the spell list, if the spell is ranked orange, it&#39;s probably not a candidate for a wand, but as a scroll it&#39;s probably a decent investment.&nbsp; Again, just be aware these are out-of-wild-shape use only.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c4">Metamagic Rods:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;All of this are great.&nbsp; The lesser rods are inexpensive and good choices for magic items at lower levels.&nbsp; At higher levels, the Quicken metamagic rod is the ultimate metamagic rod.&nbsp; Whichever you get, these are good selections.&nbsp; I strongly recommend a Lesser Silent Rod as well, for dealing with silence spells.&nbsp; Once again, remember wild-shape, though Metmatic Rods do not require speech to activate, so something like an Eagle could probably carry one in a talon.&nbsp; I would double check with your DM for their interpretation, but you should be OK.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c4">Armor:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;At low levels Hide armor will do the trick until Wild-shape is the form of choice.&nbsp; However, later on, you will want Darkwood Armor with the &quot;Wild&quot; enchantment for the best AC possible.&nbsp; The Wild enchantment ain&#39;t cheap, so be patient.&nbsp; In mid levels, you can live without it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c4">*Shields:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;As of the current rules, Shield bonus to AC translates into Wild-shape. &nbsp;However, Jason Bulmahn has verified that this is in error and shields are not intended to work in wildshape. &nbsp;As always, your DM is the final authority, but a large wooden shield may still be a smart item to have, simply for the protection it provides when you aren&#39;t wildshaped, but I wouldn&#39;t put much into enchanting it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c9">Weapons:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Not much there for a long range Druid.&nbsp; You might want to pick up a sling for use if and when your spells run out, but beyond that, not much to choose from.&nbsp; A couple tanglefoot bags are never a bad ranged weapon to have available.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c4">Staves:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I&#39;m not a big fan of most of the standard staves, but a custom staff could serve quite nicely, especially once wands aren&#39;t pulling their weight in combat anymore.&nbsp; Best to throw in two different spells of massively different effect, something like Animal Growth and Air Walk for example.&nbsp; Remember you aren&#39;t using these in wild-shape.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c4">Wondrous Items and Rings</span><span class="c0">: The obvious items are on the list like Rings of Protection, Cloaks of resistance, Belts of Dex or Con, and Wisdom boost headbands.&nbsp; Amulets of natural armor won&#39;t stack with the natural armor from Barkskin, but do stack with the NA granted from Wild-shape.&nbsp; The strand of prayer beads is nice for the Karma bead specifically.&nbsp; A couple low level pearls of power are always a good idea for a primary caster.&nbsp; Druids vestments will be an economical way to get an extra wild-shape in the levels where you could really use an extra use (levels 5 through 7).&nbsp; Special note that a Monk&#39;s Robe is not so good anymore, as Wis bonus is no longer transferred to AC.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c4">Nature Bond</span></p><p class="c1 c16"><span class="c8 c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I am about to recommend something, and&nbsp; you are not going to like it.&nbsp; However, before your defenses get up, please consider my reasoning.&nbsp; I&#39;m convinced for the Wild Mystic this is the best course of action to take.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;m recommending you give up your animal companion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The reason is because of staying power.&nbsp; One of the greatest weaknesses of the Druid as a primary caster in the past has always been that although the level of spell he can cast is equivalent to an equal level Cleric or Wizard, he has less castings per day.&nbsp; A Druid will have one less casting per day of every spell level to an equivalent Wisdom Cleric.&nbsp; If you are planning for Spells to be your exclusive form of contribution to combat, this is a near insurmountable problem.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, in Pathfinder you can make a painful sacrifice to deal with the problem.&nbsp; Give up your animal companion and take a Domain, granting you the one extra spell per spell level to bring you back in line on numbers of castings to a Wizard or a Cleric.&nbsp; It hurts to give up that companion, but what will hurt even more is the feeling of playing a caster who is out of spells, and the animal companion on its own just doesn&#39;t cut it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s going to hurt the most at level 1, where that animal companion makes up a significant measure of a Druids power, but as each level goes by, it will hurt less.&nbsp; Promise.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Druid, unlike a Cleric, only gets one domain.&nbsp; Furthermore, they pick from a reduced list.&nbsp; Finally, the spells they get from the domain cannot be spontaneously converted into Summon Natures Ally spells.&nbsp; This means, that to make this choice worthwhile, we need to have spells through the list that the Druid won&#39;t just have memorized daily, but spells he will be glad to have daily.&nbsp; The spell list becomes much more important than the domain power to determine which domain to choose.&nbsp; Let&#39;s look at each option in turn.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Note that I&#39;ll be ranking the spells here a bit differently.&nbsp; Spells that we can count on using everyday get a higher ranking.&nbsp; Those that we can&#39;t be certain of casting daily get a penalty.&nbsp; This is because we must consider that these spells cannot be spontaneously converted into Summon Nature&#39;s Ally spells - so if we don&#39;t cast them, it&#39;s no different than not having them at all.&nbsp; Therefore, we may end up with different rankings here than on the greater spell list.&nbsp; (For example, Fireball isn&#39;t a great spell, but we can be certain of casting it regularly.&nbsp; Entangle, on the other hand, is a fantastic spell, but has some terrain requirements which mean we may not be casting it daily)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4 c12">Air:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The powers are fairly tame.&nbsp; A mild blast ability and electricity resistance.&nbsp; The spell list overall is above average.&nbsp; Elemental body is rated low because Wild-shape is superior.&nbsp; Overall, this is an above average choice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">The Spells</span><span>: 1st&mdash;</span><span class="c17 c10 c4"><a class="c14" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells---final/obscuring-mist&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611517389130000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3TXdPZynzbVQMZWazKgVrY">obscuring mist</a></span><span class="c18">,</span><span>&nbsp;2nd&mdash;</span><span class="c11 c4"><a class="c14" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells---final/wind-wall%2529;&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611517389131000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2YsHN1Ym2bE7ujARMhN1eT">wind wall</a></span><span class="c18">,</span><span>&nbsp;3rd&mdash;</span><span class="c2"><a class="c14" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells---final/gaseous-form&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611517389131000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2IaP_Y_QrUk0xvwi0OyDtx">gaseous form</a></span><span class="c18">,</span><span>&nbsp;4th&mdash;</span><span class="c11 c4"><a class="c14" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells---final/air-walk&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611517389131000&amp;usg=AOvVaw27Op0X9eSzrnXvkc48p3P7">air walk</a></span><span class="c18">,</span><span>&nbsp;5th&mdash;</span><span class="c11 c4"><a class="c14" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells---final/control-winds&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611517389131000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1IhK8mLO8H6nhkVMqcjzw5">control winds</a></span><span class="c18">,</span><span>&nbsp;6th&mdash;</span><span class="c11 c4"><a class="c14" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells---final/chain-lightning&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611517389131000&amp;usg=AOvVaw00owS4aN1DNJX1_Nqc3uCx">chain lightning</a></span><span class="c18">,</span><span>&nbsp;7th&mdash;</span><span class="c17 c6 c4"><a class="c14" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells---final/elemental-body-i-1&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611517389132000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2u_l85I1z1dczfj8AwWtT1">elemental body IV</a></span><span>&nbsp;(air only)</span><span class="c18">, </span><span>8th&mdash;</span><span class="c2"><a class="c14" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells---final/whirlwind&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611517389132000&amp;usg=AOvVaw37kBwHOUKYetYaCOzg1MYh">whirlwind</a></span><span class="c18">,</span><span>&nbsp;9th&mdash;</span><span class="c11 c4"><a class="c14" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells---final/elemental-swarm-1&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611517389132000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2QkfPZAOS1_MEV1hNIqL2o">elemental swarm</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(air spell only).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c7 c4">Animal:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The 4th level ability makes this very tempting (regain your animal companion, although at Level -3), but don&#39;t get suckered in.&nbsp;

Other items that grant permanent effects function as normal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wildshaping works similarly to Polymorph spells, but there are a few notable differences, pretty much exclusively in the Druid&#39;s favor.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">1)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;First and foremost, Wildshape allows the &quot;Natural Spell&quot; feat which allows spellcasting to take place when Wildshaped.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">2)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Secondly, Armor with the &quot;Wild&quot; enchantment can still provide an armor bonus in Wildshape.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">3)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Wildshape has a duration of 1 hour/level.&nbsp; This is significantly longer than the Polymorph spells</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">4)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Using Wildshape does not provoke an attack of opportunity when used, no defensive casting required</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">5)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Being a Supernatural ability, Wildshape cannot be dispelled (though it can be suppressed by an antimagic field)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">6)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;When you wildshape into a creature that Swims or Burrows, you are able to breath in these environments</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">7)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;This is obvious, but worthy of mention anyways: Wildshape doesn&#39;t use up valuable casting slots.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The abilities of a Druid&#39;s Wildshape improve with level.&nbsp; The Natural attacks are always gained, but more abilities are gained depending on the level of the Druid:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">4th level:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Wildshape as Beast Shape 1, 1/day.&nbsp; Small or Medium animal</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">6th level:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Tiny or Large animal as Beast Shape 2, or small Elemental as Elemental body 1, 2/day</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">8th level:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Huge or diminutive animal as Beast Shape 3, &nbsp;medium Elemental as Elemental body 2, Small or Medium Plant creature as Plant shape 1, 3/day</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">10th level:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Large Elemental as Elemental body III, Large plant as Plant Shape II, 4/day</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">12th level:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Huge Elemental as Elemental body IV, Huge plant as Plant shape III, 5/day</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c15 c4">1/day extra uses every 2 levels afterwards.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lets go over the various abilities gained with Each form of Wildshape, and I&#39;ll go over some form options for each.&nbsp; You will find a lot of animals bring very much the same things to the table, so I&#39;ll cover the best choices.&nbsp; For example, Goblin Dog, Hyena and Wolf all bring identical abilities to the table for Beast Shape I, and the Riding dog is just worse (as it&#39;s slower), so listing all these creatures really makes no sense.&nbsp; Instead, I&#39;ll list your &quot;go to&quot; forms for each, covering the various abilities you may want to access.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c4">Beast Shape I:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;You aren&#39;t getting much here, but do get Climb, Fly (up to average), or Swim at a maximum of 30 feet if the creature has this movement.&nbsp;

This includes Darkvision with every form as well as special movement types (like Fly(perfect) and Earth glide).&nbsp; A size bonus of +2 to a variable ability score and a variable Natural armor bonus.&nbsp; A few special abilities (like Whirlwind and Push) are also gained.&nbsp; The way I read it, Natural spell should still work even if you are in the near-invulnerable whirlwind form.&nbsp; However, this is a loophole, and I can&#39;t recommend it for gameplay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c15 c4">Forms to consider:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">Earth:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;A nice little form.&nbsp; Earth glide is handy, and you are getting a nice +4 NA bonus.&nbsp; Not a form I would regularly take, but in a cave like environment, could be decent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">Fire:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;A Dex bonus is always welcome, and fire resistance is often handy.&nbsp; The burn ability is situational, but occasionally nice to have.&nbsp; Nothing super here, but OK.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12 c4">Air:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Going to be your preferred elemental form.&nbsp; The 60&#39; fly (perfect) is the primary selling feature, though a Dex bonus is always nice too.&nbsp; The Whirlwind feature I&#39;ve spoken of earlier.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">Water:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The Drench ability will be a very circumstantial power, but when you need it, quite effective.&nbsp; Otherwise, this form isn&#39;t offering you too much.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c4">Elemental Body II:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;As Elemental body I except the Elemental form is now Medium.&nbsp; The Ability score bonuses move up to +4, and the Natural Armor granted increases as well (by a straight +1 across the board).&nbsp; Defensively, a Dex bonus form like Air Elemental should come out a bit ahead of the Elemental body I (by one AC).&nbsp; The other forms will trade size bonus to AC to NA bonus to AC and come out even.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c15 c4">Forms to consider:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">Medium Fire:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Not a significant improvement over small, though AC should be one higher.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12 c4">Medium Air:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Not a big increase from small, but slightly better, so you might as well upgrade.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c4">Elemental Body III: </span><span class="c0">As Elemental Body II except now you are large size, you NET +6 to ability scores (no longer a single stat - and some forms include a penalty), and NA goes up by one again.&nbsp; Not a big improvement over EBII IMO.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c15 c4">Forms to consider:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">Large Air:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;No significant improvement from Medium, I would stay with medium personally, though you can probably use the whirlwind to some effect at this point I suppose.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c4">Elemental Body IV:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Now you are huge, and you get some nice goodies.&nbsp; DR 5/-, and immunity to critical hits and sneak attack.&nbsp; Natural Armor does not increase this time (which will likely result in a net loss of AC for most forms), but ability score net bonus is up to +10.&nbsp; Also, Air and Water elementals double their movement.&nbsp; That&#39;s a really nice enhancement.&nbsp; Since Elder elementals are Huge, you might as well take the Elder form.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c15 c4">Forms to Consider:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c10">Air, Elder:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;When size permits, this should become pretty much a standard for you.&nbsp; Your Defense improves, your movement is fantastic, overall, this is the right choice.&nbsp; Note too that you can start to do things with Whirlwind that you may find fun.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c4">Water, Elder:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Now probably your best water form.&nbsp; The Vortex ability is getting fairly decent as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c4">Plant Shape I:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Not a very good ability, as you can turn into a Small or Medium plant, which, after scouring the entire Bestiary, totals 4 forms.&nbsp; Every single one is a bad option.&nbsp; Therefore, until more plant creatures are available, this is a wasted ability.&nbsp; I&#39;ll go over why they are all poor options here:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c15 c4">Forms you shouldn&#39;t waste your time with:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c4">Vegepygmy:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Darkvision, Low light vision, 2x1d4 natural attacks.&nbsp; Nothing especially wonderful here, and it&#39;s a very silly creature.&nbsp; (You decide if that&#39;s a bonus or not)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c4">Basidirond:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Low light vision and a 1d8 slam attack.&nbsp; The best feature of the form you don&#39;t get with plant shape (the hallucination cloud).&nbsp; Not much here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c6">Violet Fungus:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Here&#39;s a ripoff.&nbsp; Violet Fungus can be harvested to create a venom, but they don&#39;t have a &quot;poison&quot; attack, so what you get are 4x1d4 attacks and a crappy movement speed.&nbsp; The &quot;Rot&quot; ability will not transfer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c4">Yellow Musk Creeper:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;This may be the worst polymorph option in the game.&nbsp; Reduce your speed to 5&#39; and get a 1x1d4 attack.&nbsp; We&#39;re done.&nbsp; Nothing else translates.&nbsp; I wish I had a ranking worse than red.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c4">Plant Shape II:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;For the Wild Mystic not much better.&nbsp; For a melee Druid a couple options present, but for you, nothing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c15 c4">Forms not to consider:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c4">Assassin Vine:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;You are going to be all but immobile (5&#39; move) but you do get a singe 1d8 attack with 10&#39; reach.&nbsp; The reason you may want this form is for grab and constrict, however, you should note that Entangle does not translate.&nbsp; For a Wild Mystic, this is a poor form choice.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c4">Shambling Mound:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;It gets Darkvision, Low light vision, and 2 decent slam attacks (2d6 each) and both attacks have grab and constrict.&nbsp; Also, both attacks have 10&#39; reach.&nbsp; However, there is nothing here for a Wild Mystic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c4">Plant Shape III:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Ohhhh you can get Regeneration...just kidding.&nbsp; In fact, there is only one Huge plant form, and it&#39;s the Treant which is a crappy form, and since no Plant creature in the Bestiary has regeneration, until more creatures are available, this is horrible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c15">The good news: There&#39;s only one bad option with PSIII.&nbsp; The bad news: It&#39;s the only option:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c4">Treant:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Sigh.&nbsp; No longer a good polymorph.&nbsp; You get 2 slam attacks for 2d6 each and that pretty much covers it.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c4">Playing the Wild Mystic:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So the obvious question is, &quot;Why not just play a Wizard?&quot;.&nbsp; Good question.&nbsp; I would have to say here and now, that spell for spell, I think the Wizard has a superior spell list.&nbsp; However, there is more to spellcasting than just the spell list.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Druid can expect more spell versatility on his memorization list.&nbsp; The reason is because every spell is in fact 2 spells.&nbsp; You may memorize Sleet Storm as a 3rd level spell.&nbsp; If you are a Wizard, you either cast sleet storm, or you don&#39;t.&nbsp; That&#39;s pretty much it.&nbsp; For the Druid, that Sleet Storm spell is also a Summon natures ally 3 spell.&nbsp; If an opportunity to use sleet storm does not come up, then the Druid spontaneously converts the spell, and has the always solid option of summoning at hand instead.&nbsp; The Druid has this for an option for all 9 levels of spells (unlike the Cleric).&nbsp; Furthermore, I&#39;ll take Summon Nature&#39;s Ally over the &quot;Cure&quot; line of spells any day.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The second reason to play a Druid over a Wizard is the Divine Spell mechanics.&nbsp; Most particularly, that the Druid can memorize any spell on his spell list, no spell book required.&nbsp; A Wizard may have more highly rated spells for each spell level, but he doesn&#39;t know them all.&nbsp; Instead, the Wizard gets 2 spells per level, plus whatever he can find or buy, and then scribe in his spell book.&nbsp; Not an issue for the Druid, who gets access to every spell on his spell list as soon as the spell level is available.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The third reason is number of castings.&nbsp; A Druid (with a domain) and a Wizard (specialist) should be looking at a very similar number of spells per day.&nbsp; However, the Druid will be using Wildshape as a form of Fly, Water Breathing, Burrowing, Earth glide, natural armor, gaining Darkvision, Low light vision, enhanced speed, etc.&nbsp; This saves spells, by using spell like abilities that are not available to a Wizard instead.&nbsp; This leaves more spells available for casting for the Druid.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you look beyond casting, there&#39;s more:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Saving throws.&nbsp; A Druid will have a significantly higher Fort and Will saving throw, and likely equal Reflex saving throw.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">HP: The Druid can expect to have more HP than an equivalent level Wizard</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">AC: Also likely better with the Druid than the Wizard</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;m not suggesting however, that the Druid Wild Mystic is a superior choice to a Wizard, but instead pointing out it has different strengths.&nbsp; If these strengths appeal to you, then you should consider the Wild Mystic as a real option next time you wish to play a primary caster for your group.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Limitations:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The biggest reason not to play this type of character is at low levels the Wild Mystic is going to have a hard time.&nbsp; Expect to run out of spells at low levels very easily, and feel the pain of pulling out a sling.&nbsp; Look longingly at the Wizard firing his crossbow.&nbsp; Lucky wizard.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this is unavoidable, 1st level Wild Mystics just aren&#39;t very good.&nbsp; This is the sacrifice you make when you give up an animal companion.&nbsp; Expect the Wild Mystic to come into his own around level 5, then peak around level 10 or 11.&nbsp; However, it should hold its own nicely right into the upper levels.&nbsp;</span></p></body></html>
