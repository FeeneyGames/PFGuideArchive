Let&#39;s begin:</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c19 c10 c26">The Party Roles:</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Anyone reading this who has not been playing D&amp;D over the past thirty years may not know that there are some</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">fairly &quot;official&quot; party roles that date back to the original basic set.&nbsp; They are Fighter, Thief, Magic User and Cleric.&nbsp; The idea is that</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">the Cleric heals, the Fighter takes hits and does damage, the Thief opens locks, disarms traps and backstabs, and the Magic User</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">throws magic missiles and fireballs.&nbsp; These roles are every bit as outdated as Basic D&amp;D itself, yet you still see players flocking to</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&quot;fill&quot; these roles, thinking that this remains the most effective party, despite a game that resembles Basic D&amp;D cosmetically only.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">How many times have you gotten/sent an email when wondering what kind of character you could make, and a reply comes up with something like,</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&quot;We have a Rogue, a Druid and a Sorcerer.&quot;&nbsp; The implication of course is, &quot;Make a fighter-type&quot;, but in fact, the email is useless.&nbsp; Is the Rogue a melee rogue or an archery rogue?&nbsp; Is the Druid going to be engaging in melee?&nbsp; What kind of spells will the Sorcerer have?&nbsp; Maybe the best thing for this party is a Wizard, or another rogue...who knows?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Instead the email should say, &quot;In combat we&#39;ve got a Tank, a Striker and a Battlefield Controller, another Tank would be great.&nbsp; Out of combat we need a party face.&nbsp; How about some kind of Melee character with some social skills?&quot;&nbsp; Characters are too flexible in D&amp;D (and Pathfinder) to define role by class.&nbsp; Instead the role should be defined by what they do.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">The mechanics of the game changed enough in 3.0 that the optimal party changed with them, yet many players never realized that</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">the iconic party is no longer optimal, so we still see Wizards throwing fireballs (sorry, just threw up a bit in my mouth), and Clerics</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">running around healing, wondering why they can&#39;t heal as fast as the party seems to take damage.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">The reality is that D&amp;D isn&#39;t all combat, but combat plays a major role in pretty much every campaign.&nbsp; Therefore you can break</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">party roles into two major categories.&nbsp; The &quot;out of combat&quot; roles, and the &quot;combat&quot; roles.&nbsp; Lets look at how the God Wizard fits into</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">each.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c19 c26 c10">5 OUT OF COMBAT ROLES:</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c16 c10 c12">Social (&quot;The Fop&quot;):</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Can the wizard fill this role?&nbsp; Well if you specialize in enchantment kinds of spells, then you very well might be able to, but, you shouldn&#39;t.&nbsp; First, you aren&#39;t the best choice to fill this role, and secondly, this guy tends to think he&#39;s the leader, do you know what happens to the leader?&nbsp; He gets targeted first.&nbsp; Let the Paladin, Cleric or Bard take this role.&nbsp; Pretend you&#39;re jealous.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c16 c10 c12">Sneak (&quot;The Corpse&quot;):</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Can the wizard fill this role?&nbsp; Well if you specialize in spells that imitate the iconic rogue skills like invisibility and knock, and a few divinations you very well might be able to, but, you shouldn&#39;t.&nbsp; The purpose of the Sneak is to scout out ahead in the enemies lair, look for traps and disarm them, scout out the enemy and report back, and do this all alone.&nbsp; Wonder why I call him &quot;the Corpse&quot;?&nbsp; Read what he does again.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c16 c10 c12">Healbot (&quot;The Gimp&quot;):</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Can the wizard fill this role?&nbsp; Actually, in Pathfinder he can&#39;t, but don&#39;t worry, you don&#39;t want it.&nbsp; The party Gimp gets to use up all his resources &quot;servicing&quot; the party between combats.&nbsp; Sound pleasant?&nbsp; That&#39;s why he&#39;s the gimp.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c16 c10 c12">The Lump (&quot;The lump&quot;):</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I can&#39;t think of another name for him.&nbsp; He&#39;s the character of the player that made his character specifically for combat, and is really uninterested whenever he&#39;s not rolling his attack rolls.&nbsp; He makes the best use of his time when not in combat by snoozing, or reading a novel, or making it very clear to the DM that he&#39;s bored.&nbsp; You DEFINITELY don&#39;t want to be this guy.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c16 c10 c13">Utility Caster (&quot;Everything else&quot;):</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The party transporter, the party Diviner. One way or another - this is the casters&#39; role - in other words - this is you.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">That&#39;s pretty much it.&nbsp; A party should look to cover all those bases (except the lump, but all too often it gets filled regardless, and often a single character can fill more than one (The party Cleric may be both the Fop and the Gimp...lucky guy), but let&#39;s be honest here, D&amp;D is largely about combat, so even if you have a character that is the Fop, the Corpse, the Gimp and the Utility Caster, if you aren&#39;t contributing to combat, then you are a liability to your party, because when characters die, it&#39;s usually in combat.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c19 c26 c10">The Four Combat Roles:</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 232.00px; height: 213.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.jpg" style="width: 232.00px; height: 213.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c21 c18 c10 c12">The Tank: (&quot;The Big Stupid Fighter&quot;):</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">This role involves two things: Doing Hit Points damage to BBEG (big bad evil guy), forcing BBEG to attack you with his viscous weaponry.

Fortunately, you can help out when needed.&nbsp; Focusing on any of these areas shouldn&#39;t be your prime concern, but consider yourself a &quot;patch&quot; for a leak.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c16 c10">The Fop:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Your charisma likely ain&#39;t great, and you likely have all the social skills of the Big Stupid Fighter.&nbsp; Filling this role is going to be a challenge.&nbsp; However, you can provide some aid to the party Fop when required.&nbsp; The key here is enhancement and enchantment.&nbsp; Use enhancement spells like Eagle&#39;s Splendor if your party Fop isn&#39;t all he should be, and even a simple prestidigitation can clean him and his clothes up when he stinks like he&#39;s been crawling a dungeon for the past week.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c16 c10">The Corpse:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;You aren&#39;t any kind of sneak, but you can magically cover the skills.&nbsp; If the party is short on the scouts, a planar bound Imp is a pretty good one.&nbsp; Even a low level summoned monster (like a Dire Rat) can scout out under a door or around a corner.&nbsp; Your familiar can also make a great scout.&nbsp; Who&#39;s to know yet another bat in the cave is in fact an intelligent creature?&nbsp; Knock spells trump any open lock skills, and don&#39;t worry about disarming traps...set them off (not personally, but that summoned Dire Rat can, or perhaps an unseen servant to open doors and chests that may be otherwise dangerous.&nbsp; Invisibility + Fly is as good as any stealth skill most of the time.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c16 c10">The Gimp:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Did you know that a 9th level wizard can cast Cure Serious Wounds?&nbsp; OK, OK, not directly, but he CAN summon a Bralani Azata, and that Bralani Azata can cast Cure Serious Wounds...twice.&nbsp; Not something you want to do often, but if you need some quick healing in a combat, it can be done.&nbsp; That said, the wizard is an absolute terrible healer, but he can help out in a healing weak party.&nbsp; Out of combat, don&#39;t get suckered into doing this.&nbsp; Get some cure light wounds wands (one of the best deals in the game) and somebody in the party surely can use it (whether Cleric, Druid, Bard or anyone with Use Magic Device)</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c16 c10">The Big Stupid Fighter:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Obviously you will never do this personally, but that&#39;s what summoning spells are for right?&nbsp; A summoned critter may not be as tough as a PC fighter, but he takes up space, draws attacks, and has some form of attack as well...and they never need healing after the fight.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c16 c10">The Striker:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;That&#39;s what Blast spells make a wizard.&nbsp; I&#39;m not a fan of these kinds of spells, but they have their place, and that&#39;s the place of a weak striker in the party.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c16 c10">The Waste of Space:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Everything I&#39;ve just pointed out you want to avoid doing.&nbsp; Wizards aren&#39;t the best at any of these roles, and when you start filling these roles you will notice your spells running out really fast.&nbsp; A Wizard may be able to do nearly anything, but don&#39;t get fooled into thinking he can do everything.&nbsp; Spells/day is the limitation that ensures that a Wizard doesn&#39;t get too big for his britches, or he finds himself filling the one role you never wanted to, the &quot;Waste or space&quot;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c19 c26 c10">Get a Job&nbsp;NA-NA-NA-NA, NA-NA-NA-NA-NA:</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">In combat, the God wizard doesn&#39;t have one job, or two, he&#39;s got three...yippee!&nbsp;

spells should be recreation only:</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10">The first point</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is that in 3.0, blast spells became in inefficient way to do damage.&nbsp; Look at a fireball for example.&nbsp; Cast by a 5th level wizard it does 5d6 damage...but not really, saving throws can reduce that by half, evasion can eliminate it entirely, and improved evasion will at least cut it in half.&nbsp; Then you take into account fire resistance (AFTER the save), which will very commonly reduce it further by 5, 10, 20, or even offer full immunity...and fire resistance and immunity is common.&nbsp; In the end, that Fireball will do 20 points of damage if you are lucky, more likely, anywhere from 5 to 10 damage.&nbsp; So how many creatures that you fight at level 5 can take that?&nbsp; Yep...all of them, while laughing at you.&nbsp; Now how much damage does a Haste spell do?&nbsp; Well, you would need to take one average attack from every party member for every round of duration and add them together.&nbsp; The number will vary, but it will dwarf the damage of a fireball spell.&nbsp; You don&#39;t get the glory, but you did the right thing.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10">Then the second point</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is a tactical one.&nbsp; HP damage in Pathfinder does NOT decrease your ability to fight.&nbsp; The big bad monster with 1 HP has just as deadly attack as the big bad monster with 100 hp.&nbsp; &quot;Softening&quot; up the enemy with a blast spell may or may not change the time it takes the rest of the party to drop the enemy, but it does nothing to ensure their safety during that time.&nbsp; Giving your allies a tactical or mechanical advantage prevents party deaths.&nbsp; Throw a blast when you have nothing better to do, but never throw one when you have one of your 3 jobs to do.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">I&#39;m not saying you should never do pure blast.&nbsp; In fact, my own wizards usually have a blast or two at hand.&nbsp; I&#39;m just saying that blasting is something you do after you&#39;ve ensured tactical advantage in the combat.&nbsp; Blasting in combat should be....what comes after tertiary?&nbsp;</span><span style="overflow: hidden;

So much so, that I need a special section to explain why you should do it.&nbsp; So why summon?&nbsp; Here&#39;s a few reasons.&nbsp; There&#39;s more than this, but these are the main advantages.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">1) Doing Damage: Summoned creatures aren&#39;t a one shot damage spell.&nbsp; Summons do damage every round, the blast spell that keeps on blasting.&nbsp; Note that Celestial and Fiendish Templates no longer add INT to the animal, but they do provide the new and improved Smite Evil/Good mechanic - which is a signficant offensive boost.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">2) Taking Damage: Every time the enemy attacks a summoned creature you win.&nbsp; That&#39;s an attack that would have gone towards you or your allies.&nbsp; Whether it hits or not really doesn&#39;t matter all that much, because you never need to heal a summoned creature after battle.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">3) Battlefield Control: Summoned creatures do more than attack, they also grapple, trip, and block the enemy, they also provide cover.&nbsp; Many summoned creatures are amazing grapplers.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">4) Extra Spellcasting: Is casting one spell per round getting you down?&nbsp; Well, there are always quickened spells, but they are so darned expensive.&nbsp; What if you summon a creature with Spell Like Abilities?&nbsp; Then you cast, the summoned creature casts, and it&#39;s like your own little quickened spell every round.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">5) Mounts: Sometimes you need a quick way to get your pet Big Stupid Fighter up to the big bad guy with wings.&nbsp; That&#39;s where a quick summoning can be very handy.&nbsp; A Dire Bat or any number of large (or larger) flying creatures can make effective quick mounts to get your party where they need to be.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">6) Perception: Ever had that invisible guy you just couldn&#39;t find?&nbsp; You have a glitterdust but don&#39;t know where to aim it, and you left your see invisible spell unmemorized today.&nbsp; No problem, a quick summoning spell and your Dire Bat will be attacking the offending square using its blindsense.&nbsp; Now you know where to throw that glitterdust spell.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c19 c26 c10">What STATS does GOD have anyways?</span></p><p class="c6 c20"><span class="c19 c26 c10"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Unfortunately - no matter how close to God you become - your DM is closer.&nbsp; Hopefully your DM has gone the more progressive route of a no-luck version of character creation, and allows point buy for stats, but some old-time DM&#39;s out there can&#39;t get past the idea that your stat rolls should involve the &quot;luck of the dice&quot;.</span></p><p class="c6 c20"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>Any way you slice it - here&#39;s the simple rules I follow when making my God. </span><span class="c10">Highest stat goes to </span><span class="c10 c13">INT</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;- no exception</span><span>. (and all my stat increases will be going into INT) My </span><span class="c10 c14">CON</span><span>&nbsp;is always at least 12 (14 is better if you can). Whatever else I can afford goes into </span><span class="c10 c14">DEX</span><span>. This is </span><span class="c25">before</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Racial modifiers.</span></p><p class="c6 c20"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10">Random Roll:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Put your highest roll into INT. Dex and Con should have your second and third highest roll, and the other stats get the dump. If your 3rd highest stat is at least 12, put your second highest stat into DEX, otherwise, your second highest stat should go to CON.</span></p><p class="c6 c20"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10">Point Buy: </span><span class="c0">What point buy you have will make a difference, but you can dump Strength, Wisdom and Charisma, so usually you can do pretty well overall.&nbsp; Here&#39;s some examples:</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10">12-point buy:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Str 7 (-4), Dex 16 (10), Con 12 (2), Int 16 (10), Wis 7 (-4), Cha 8 (-2)</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10">15-point buy:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Str 7 (-4), Dex 16 (10), Con 12 (2), Int 17 (13), Wis 7 (-4), Cha 8 (-2)</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10">20-point buy:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Str 7 (-4), Dex 16 (10), Con 13 (3), Int 18 (17), Wis 7 (-4), Cha 8 (-2)</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10">25-point buy:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Str 8 (-2), Dex 16 (10), Con 14 (5), Int 18 (17), Wis 7 (-4), Cha 9 (-1)</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Obviously these aren&#39;t set in stone.&nbsp; If you want to have a decent strength (maybe your DM is an encumbrance Nazi), then drop the Dex to a 14, or whatever you need to do.&nbsp; The most important thing is you make sure your Intelligence is your top priority, and that Dex and Con, in that order, are number 2 and 3.&nbsp; The rest are dump stats.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c19 c26 c10">What Race is God?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">In Pathfinder, you&#39;ve got great choices for Wizards, and more than that, your choices are flexible.&nbsp;

A +2 to Dex and Int is huge, and the -2 Con is no longer a game-breaker.&nbsp; In addition, the elf gets a +2 bonus to defeat SR, being a racial bonus, this should stack with the Spell Penetration feats.&nbsp; Bonuses to spellcraft (for identifying items) and low light vision, and other little tidbits are all welcome, although the primary selling features we&#39;ve already covered.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c18 c10 c14">Human:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;With a flexible stat bonus you can get that all important +2 Int score.&nbsp; The lack of racial features matters less with the Wizard that can duplicate many of those features with spells.&nbsp; The extra skill point is great, as is the extra feat.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c14 c18">Half-Elf:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Pretty much full out trumped by the Elf, however, you&#39;ll still take the +2 Int score, which is the most important feature, and you get a skill focus which is nice too.&nbsp; Not my first choice, but the +2 Int alone puts it in the same league.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c18 c10 c14">Half Orc:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;*cries*, yes, you can give your Half-Orc a +2 Int.&nbsp; I know, I know, it&#39;s just wrong.&nbsp; However, in addition to that, the Half-Orc is actually an excellent choice, one I would only put second to the &quot;made for the wizard&quot; elf.&nbsp; The reason is the Orc Ferocity ability.&nbsp; If there is any class that can benefit more from that one-last-standard-action than a Wizard, I don&#39;t know what it is.&nbsp; That said, hopefully this is an ability you will never need.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18 c10">Dwarves, Halflings and Gnomes:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Not great choices, though any of them can still make a good wizard.&nbsp; In general, a +2 Int score is the best thing you can get with race, but not having it by no means makes a Wizard worthless.&nbsp; However, this is an optimization Guide, and the optimal choices will have that +2 Int score.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c19 c26 c10">Arcane Bond: Pick your double edged sword:</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">I&#39;m not a huge fan of Arcane Bonds.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Well, they are both double edged swords.&nbsp; Advantages that have a significant possibility to be disadvantages.&nbsp; However, you get them anyways, so lets check out the choices, and the advantage and disadvantage of each.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c18 c10 c12">The Bonded Object</span><span class="c18">:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Remember in &quot;The Two Towers&quot; when Sauroman&#39;s staff was destroyed how screwed he was?&nbsp; Welcome to the bonded object.&nbsp; This object gives you a free spell of any level you can cast, as long as it is in your spellbook, absolutely free and spontaneous, once per day.&nbsp; This is a nice advantage, especially at low levels when you are short on castings.&nbsp; In fact, a first level Specialist Wizard with a Bonded Object gets just as many castings per day as a Sorcerer.&nbsp; Yeah...nice.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Now the downside.&nbsp; Bonded items can be destroyed or lost or stolen, and you only can have one, and they take awhile to replace (1 week before you can cast a ritual that costs 200gp/level to replace the item).&nbsp; During that time how screwed are you?&nbsp; Super screwed.&nbsp; Every spell you cast requires a DC 20+spell level caster check.&nbsp; OK, EVENTUALLY this will be an auto-succeed, but that&#39;s only going to be at high levels.&nbsp; Until then, you have a chance (and at low levels a good chance) for every spell you cast to fail.&nbsp; Welcome to Hell.&nbsp; Rings or amulets of course are less likely to be damaged in combat, but they are even easier to steal, and they take up a valuable item slot.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Now how big a disadvantage this is really is going to depend on your DM.&nbsp; However, I always have a second copy of my spellbook hidden away somewhere, but I can&#39;t have a second copy of a Bonded Object, so that makes me nervous.&nbsp; In the end, my point is, there are two sides to this coin, one gives you a moderate advantage, the other absolutely destroys you for at least a week.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c18 c10 c14">The Bonded Creature (Familiar):</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The obvious disadvantage of a familiar is that, with 1/2 your HP, the Familiar is relatively vulnerable, and not especially difficult to kill.&nbsp; However, also note that unlike previous editions, there is no penalty to you for the death of your familiar (except the loss of the familiar, which can be replaced later at cost).&nbsp; If your familiar dies, you still can cast spells, which makes me more inclined towards this bond.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Familiars can be quite useful, they can be great scouts, can eventually deliver touch spells (though this is dangerous because it identifies the familiar as a target) and deliver messages, as well as give you a moderate bonus on a skill or saving throw (and you always get alertness when the familiar is close), and the familiar gets your skill ranks, so you get a second roll on knowledges or that type of thing.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Overall, I&#39;m not a huge fan of familiars, the bonuses they give are pretty minor, and sometimes keeping them safe is a pain, but they are never worse than nothing, which a Bonded Object could be, so therefore, they get my complete endorsement and suggestion.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c19 c26 c10">Specialization, God&#39;s choices:</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">In general you will find that the weight of spells that serve the style of the &quot;God Wizard&quot; fall more under Conjuration than any other school.&nbsp; For that reason, you should consider Conjuration specialty based on that alone.&nbsp; For the most part, the specialization abilities are pretty minor (although nice to have), but that said, you can make a God Wizard that follows any school as a specialist.&nbsp; Keep in mind that you can cast from prohibited schools, but should avoid doing so except when necessary, because the cost is double.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c16 c10">Abjuration School:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;As a school, Abjuration is for the most part a one-trick-pony.&nbsp;

That&#39;s a bit extreme, divination does other things as well, but by and large, that is what much of the school is built around.&nbsp; Filling one spell of every level in divination can actually be a bit daunting.&nbsp;

After all, they are all feats specially for casters, so shouldn&#39;t they be your best option?&nbsp; Well, maybe they should be.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">Metamagic Feats:</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">I guess the first thing I should mention about metamagic feats is that, generally speaking, a 3rd level spell plus 2 levels of metamagic is more powerful than a normal 3rd level spell, but no more powerful than a 5th level spell (and very often, less powerful).&nbsp; So this leads to the question: Why am I spending feats so I can just fill my upper level slots with spells that aren&#39;t any better than my upper level slots?&nbsp; Good question.&nbsp; In addition, if you are using an offensive spell with metamagic, note that the DC will be based on the original spell level (unless you are using heighten)</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">That said, some Metamagic feats are actually important to have access to.&nbsp; When you are silenced, it&#39;s very important to have some non-verbal component options, when you are paralyzed or movement restricted, some non-semantic spells are sure nice to have.&nbsp; When you get to high level, quicken spell is almost a must, allowing you to piggyback a lower level spell with a higher level one.&nbsp; I personally use extend all the time.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">However, this is where the metamagic rods come in.&nbsp; If you go to the Rods section, you will see some followed by &quot;X, lesser metamagic&quot; these are the ones you should jump at the chance to get.&nbsp; When you get silenced, even a lesser silent spell rod is going to give you lots of spell options (ummm..maybe dispel that silence?).</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">I&#39;m not saying you shouldn&#39;t take metamagic feats, but it&#39;s easy to overvalue them.&nbsp; Pick up a few through your career, but don&#39;t overdo it, you&#39;ll find you aren&#39;t getting enough out of them otherwise.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c12">Empower Spell:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Skip it.&nbsp;

Note that &quot;Sizes&quot; are not increased, so you can&#39;t enlarge a cone spell for example.&nbsp; As a 1 level metamagic, it&#39;s not too expensive, and I could potentially see using it on a long range spell to snipe at super range, however, really, probably a once in a blue moon kind of metamagic.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c14">Extend Spell:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I do recommend it.&nbsp; It&#39;s one level for double the duration.&nbsp; Spells like Rope Trick are going to rely on extend until you get to 8th level for example.&nbsp; I find myself using this on self buffs or utilities fairly regularly.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c12">Heighten Spell:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Mostly of use in loopholes and abuses, for regular use I just can&#39;t recommend making a 3rd level spell a 4th level spell, just so it&#39;s treated as 4th level.&nbsp; You are almost universally better just memorizing a 4th level spell.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c12">Maximize Spell:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;For the 3 levels this adds to the spell, there is almost no spell I think maximize spell is worth it for.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c14">Quicken Spell:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;At high level, using quickened spells is kind of a staple (even necessary), though I find that a lesser quicken rod can serve you nicely if you don&#39;t want to spend the feat slot (or pay the 4 level increase)</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c10">Silent Spell:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Although I don&#39;t recommend this for wizards (because you never know when you need it), a lesser silent rod may be the best item for the cost you can get in the game.&nbsp; When you get silenced, you draw the rod and cast away.&nbsp; For a sorcerer, this feat is handy.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c10">Still Spell:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Not available as a standard metamagic rod unfortunately, but mainly for use if you are paralyzed, or really don&#39;t want to be identified as the source of a spell (in these cases, Still spell will need to be used in conjunction with Silent Spell).&nbsp; Some method of casting silent spells (such as the Rod) should really be obtained first, as Silent Spell is more useful on its own than Still Spell is.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c12">Widen Spell:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Increasing a spells area by 100% sounds great, but 3 levels to increase - an absolutely terrible deal.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">Item Creation Feats:</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">To me, item creation feats are kind of like watching Martha Stewart (&quot;Why buy your magic items at the store, you can make them at home for a fraction of the cost!&quot;).&nbsp; That&#39;s pretty much it. &nbsp;Make your own magic items and save your money.&nbsp; It&#39;s like selling your feat slots.&nbsp; In a campaign where magic items are hard to come by, you may actually need these feats to properly equip yourself and your party, but you don&#39;t have to like it.&nbsp; In the end, you aren&#39;t going to get much fun out of item creation feats, and I personally almost never take them, but if you need to create, or you want to sell off your feat slots for cash, here&#39;s some options.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c12">Brew Potion:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Potions are bad, overpriced, and restricted for which spells you can apply.&nbsp; Avoid buying potions, and definitely avoid brewing them.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c10">Craft Magic Arms and Armor:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The most common magic items to find in the game, however, there could be some definite value to this if someone in your party uses a rare style of weapon, and you can&#39;t buy magic items, but for most wizards this isn&#39;t worthwhile.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c12">Craft Rod:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Well you will definitely want rods, however, usually you want the rod to cover a metamagic feat that you DON&#39;T have.&nbsp; I think you should just buy your rods, they&#39;re cheap.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c10">Craft Staff:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;If you are going to item create, this is a good choice.&nbsp; Staves are expensive, and I&#39;m not a big fan because of the cost, but at half price they are better.&nbsp; The important thing is you can cast the spells on the staff with your full caster level, even when you enchant the staff with a lesser caster level.&nbsp; Also there is no limit to the level of spell you can put in the staff.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c12">Craft Wand</span><span class="c0">: Probably worse than craft staff in almost every way.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c10">Craft Wondrous Item:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Could be handy for a campaign where you have trouble buying this stuff.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c12">Forge Ring:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Very specialized item list, really, I can&#39;t see this being worth a feat.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c10">Scribe Scroll:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Actually one of the better item creation feats, and you&#39;ve got it anyways.&nbsp; Use this to create scrolls of those really circumstantial spells that you don&#39;t want to memorize, but may really need someday.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c16 c10">Other Feats you may want to consider:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c12">Arcane Armor Training:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Only listed to tell you not to get this.&nbsp; If you use this feat you must activate it every round you cast as a swift action - so no quickened spells for you.&nbsp; All this for armor that you can effectively duplicate with spells.&nbsp; Besides - AC isn&#39;t your best defense anyways.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c14">Augment Summoning:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I love summoning, did I mention that?&nbsp; Augment Summoning adds a substantial bonus to your summoned critters (+4 Str and Con), that&#39;s 2 HP per HD, and a nice offensive boost.&nbsp; If you are going to be summoning, this is worthwhile.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c12">Arcane Strike</span><span class="c0">: God wizards don&#39;t want this, it&#39;s more for Gish types.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c14">Combat Casting:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Get a +4 to defensive casting checks or checks to cast when grappled.&nbsp; You can&#39;t get Skill Focus: Concentration anymore, since Concentration isn&#39;t a skill - so this is really the only feat to boost your defensive casting.&nbsp; Personally I avoid situations where I would need to defensive cast like the plague, but defensive casting is harder in Pathfinder, so this may be worth the investment.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c14">Defensive Combat Training:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Use your HD instead of your BAB when determining your CMD.&nbsp; I think this is a really good choice for any wizard.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c10">Eschew materials:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I wouldn&#39;t jump at this feat, but at higher levels when you start polymorphing into dragons, your component pouch disappears.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c12">Improved Counterspell:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Counterspelling really isn&#39;t very good most of the time, rather than ready a spell to counterspell, just casting a spell is usually better.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c13">Improved Familiar:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I wouldn&#39;t jump at this at the first opportunity, but when the 7th level critters become available, the Mephits, Imp or Quasit are all great choices.&nbsp; If you take opposable thumbs, the ability to speak, and the Use Magic Device skill for example (or just having the familiar throw the alchemists fire before you cast Pyrotechnics) - opportunities abound.&nbsp; Be aware that you are giving up the familiar &quot;bonus&quot; you received with your old familiar.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c13">Improved Initiative:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Get this.&nbsp; Initiative is more important for the party Wizard than any other party member, and even more important for battlefield control spells.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c10">Mounted Combat:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Specifically you want this only if you use a phantom steed - if you do use a phantom steed, this is a really good feat to have.&nbsp; (Phantom steeds are squishy)&nbsp; For earlier levels, this spell is really only one you want if the campaign is &quot;horse-friendly&quot; since most horses will not accompany you down into the dungeon.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c10">Nimble Moves:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;losing a 5&#39; step in difficult terrain can be bad when you are caught by a big pointy stick user.&nbsp; Nimble Moves lets you take that important 5&#39; step away before turning him into a newt for his impudence.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c10">Spell Focus:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Increases the DC by 1 for one school.&nbsp; Certain schools benefit more from this feat (Enchantment, Evocation, Necromancy, Conjuration), and certain ones less (Transmutation, Abjuration, Divination).&nbsp; Generally, you want Spell Focus Conjuration if you want Augment Summoning, then maybe one for your specialist school, depending on the school.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c10">Greater Spell Focus:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Unless you really concentrate on one school of spell, this probably isn&#39;t worth it.&nbsp; Maybe in your specialist school, depending on what school that is.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c12">Spell Mastery</span><span class="c0">: I&#39;ve never had use of this, and the use is rather specific.&nbsp; If it allowed you to prepare all your spells without a spellbook I would be all over it.&nbsp; Just make sure you get 2 spellbooks as soon as you can.&nbsp; Then use spells like Secret Chest to ensure you always have access to a spellbook.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c14">Spell Penetration:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;This is a good idea for most wizards.&nbsp; A lot of battlefield control spells ignore spell resistance, and you can always buff if SR of the enemy is a problem, nevertheless, you WILL be making rolls to overcome spell resistance in your career, and +2 is a nice bonus.&nbsp; Note that the elven racial ability stacks.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c10">Greater Spell Penetration:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Yet another +2, I&#39;m less concerned with getting yet another +2, although it&#39;s not a bad choice.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c13">Toughness:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Classes with lower base HP benefit more from this feat, and Wizards are no exception.&nbsp; Also, the deal is best at first level, so either this or Improved Initiative (or both if you&#39;re human) are the best 1st level choices.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c21 c18 c10 c28">God got Skillz:</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c14">Fly</span><span class="c0">: You are definitely going to be flying at some point, and this improves your ability to maneuver, which is a good thing.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c13">Spellcraft:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Kind of a staple for Wizards, used to identify spells and magic items.&nbsp; This is an obvious choice</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c14">Knowledges</span><span class="c0">: The ones that you want are Arcane, Nature, Religion, and The Planes.&nbsp; This allows identification of the largest number of critters.&nbsp; All knowledges are Int based and are decent choices though.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c14">Lingustics:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I recommend learning Celestial, Infernal, Abyssal, Terran, Ingan, Aurian, and Aquan if you plan to do much summoning.&nbsp; Always nice to be able to give verbal commands.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c14">Escape Artist:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;If you aren&#39;t going to take the Defensive Combat Training feat, then you definitely want this maxed out to help you escape grapples.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c10">Ride:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;If you use Mounted Combat and Phantom Steeds, then you want this maxed out.&nbsp; It&#39;s not a class skill - but that&#39;s OK</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c14">Perception:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The most used skill in the game.&nbsp; You will never be great at this, but it&#39;s worth having nonetheless.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c21 c18 c10 c28">Favoured Class: Wizard.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">You have a high Int score and not too many skill requirements, but your HP are tied for the lowest of any class.&nbsp; Don&#39;t let D6 fool you, HP are never high enough.&nbsp; Put your extra into HP every time, every level.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c21 c18 c10 c28">Prestige Class Options:</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">The Question of the Scribed Spells: So when you take a PrC that gives you &quot;+1 spellcasting level&quot; do you get the 2 free spells in your spellbook?&nbsp; The answer is, I think so.&nbsp; However, the rules are ambiguous, and there&#39;s been no official ruling at this time that I&#39;m aware of.&nbsp; 3.5 had the same ambiguity.&nbsp; If your DM says you don&#39;t, then PrC&#39;s aren&#39;t for you, just go straight wizard.&nbsp; Giving up your 2 spells/level is absolutely devastating and makes every PrC in the game an absolute powerdown.&nbsp; This section is only for sensible DM&#39;s that give the 2 spells/level with PrC spellcaster level increases.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c10">Arcane Archer:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;So here&#39;s the trick, you take 2 levels of Arcane Archer then go back to being a Wizard.&nbsp; This costs you one spellcasting level, and you get the ultra-powerful &quot;Imbue Arrow&quot; ability.&nbsp; The real power of this is you can put area spells that normally have to be centered on the caster.&nbsp; Antimagic Field is the obvious an incredibly powerful option.&nbsp; Of course you have to take 3 feats that really aren&#39;t of any use to you to enter this, and you give up a caster level, all for one trick.&nbsp; It&#39;s a very nice trick though.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c12">Arcane Trickster:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Here&#39;s some news for you if you hadn&#39;t already heard it, Wizard 3/Rogue 3 is terrible.&nbsp; Terrible.&nbsp; Terrible.&nbsp; You have to endure this situation in order to enter this prestige class.&nbsp; That&#39;s the problem with hybrids, right as you qualify for the class you really suck.&nbsp; For God wizards, the abilities are pretty worthless too.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c10">Eldritch Knight:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;A Prestige Class for Gish wizards, not god wizards.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c14">Loremaster:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The feat requirements are pretty stiff, but that said there are some nice benefits to going this route.&nbsp; Lore is just nice if you have lots of knowledges, and almost all the secrets are decent too (The +1 to hit does not impress).&nbsp; It&#39;s not fantastic, but probably better than straight wizard</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c10">Mystic Theurge:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;If you want a Cleric/Wizard, then this is really your only option to make that viable.&nbsp; However, be aware that a Wizard 3/Cleric 3 is an absolutely horrible multiclass, and although it looks better when you are a Wizard 3/Cleric 3/Mystic Theurge X, remember, you need to survive to 7th level before that ever happens, and it&#39;s really going to suck for you from levels 4 through 6 (and probably a few levels after that).&nbsp; When you get to Cleric 3/Wizard 3/MT 10, the build maxes out, and whatever you take for your 17th level onwards, you will face a power decrease in comparison to the other characters again.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c21 c18 c10 c28">Equipment Choices:</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c14">Small shield, Mithril:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Arrow deflection and Slick seem like the obvious enchantment choices here, or just use it to up your AC.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c14">Ring of Protection:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;A staple, add a deflection bonus to your AC.&nbsp; This works against touch attack too.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c14">Ring of Sustenance:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Lets you prepare spells after 2 hours rest (still only 1/day).&nbsp; This is pretty useful for a pretty cheap ring.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c10">Ring of Wizardry</span><span class="c0">: A fairly expensive way to get extra spell slots, pearls of power are generally cheaper (and don&#39;t take item slots) but still very useful.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c13">Rod of Metamagic Extend, Lesser</span><span class="c0">: Yes, yes, yes - cheap and very handy for long duration buffing and of course, rope trick.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c13">Rod of Metamagic Silent, lesser:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;You&#39;ll eventually regret it if you don&#39;t buy this.&nbsp; When you get targeted with silence, draw the rod, cast a spell.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c13">Rod of Metamaic Quicken, lesser:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Expensive and very, very good.&nbsp; Your 3rd level spells you quicken are effectively 8th level spells.&nbsp; Maybe not that expensive.&nbsp; When you get to higher levels, being able to cast twice per round is significant.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c14">Other Metamagic Rods:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;All metamagic rods are good, they are all worth the price.&nbsp; The one&#39;s listed individually are musts - but they are all good.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c14">Rod of Absorption:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;A great defensive item that will grab up the spells directed at you.&nbsp; Great news!&nbsp; You can then use that spell energy to power your own spells!&nbsp; The price tag is steep, and the item only holds 50 levels of spells, but it&#39;s worthwhile.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c14">Scrolls:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;You want a number of scrolls, below here I will recommend under certain spells that they make better scrolls than memorizations.&nbsp; The general rule is this, spells that are really good in certain circumstances, but the circumstance is rare and not in your control, that makes a good scroll.&nbsp; An example would be &quot;Tongues&quot;.&nbsp; Also, low level scrolls are a really good deal, the higher level you go, then not so much.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c10">Staves</span><span class="c0">: In general, staves are overpriced, if you need more castings, you are better off with Pearls of Power.&nbsp; That said, it&#39;s important to note that a staff uses your Caster Level, which makes it actually useful for offensive spells.&nbsp; Because of the mechanics, staves that have less spells within them are a better deal.&nbsp; If you are getting a custom staff - pick 2 spells that have versatile use, like a summon spell and a buff spell for example.&nbsp; Theme staves are cool, but they aren&#39;t efficient use of resources.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c14">Wands:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;First level wands are a great deal.&nbsp; Find first level spells that don&#39;t rely too much on caster level, or save DC&#39;s, and you may cast often, and get them as wands.&nbsp; Silent Image is a great example, so is protection from evil (why not have one of each?&nbsp; Protection from evil, good, chaos and Law?) Second level wands are an OK deal.&nbsp; Third and Fourth level wands are overpriced.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c10">Bracers of armor:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Overrated for wizards.&nbsp; Mage armor gives +4 Armor bonus and lasts one hour/level.&nbsp; Save your money.&nbsp; That said, when you get up into the upper ranges (+8 or so), if you are still relying on AC at all (your best defense won&#39;t be armor at that point), then it might be worthwhile.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c14">Pearl of Power:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The first level spell version is an incredible deal, the second level version is a pretty good deal too.&nbsp; As the levels increase, the deal gets worse.&nbsp; Definitely get a few level 1 pearls, and eventually a couple level 2 pearls, maybe one or two level 3 pearls someday.&nbsp; You&#39;ll find them very handy.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c14">Efficient Quiver:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Clearly better for Wands, Rods and Staves than for Bows and Arrows.&nbsp; Buy all those level 1 wands and then call them to use when you need them.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c13">Handy Haversack:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Definitely handy.&nbsp; I love this item, a great way to organize a large number of items.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c13">Headband of Vast Int:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Obviously your headband of choice.&nbsp; Really, Cha and Wis aren&#39;t really important for you, so don&#39;t worry about those multiple stat boost headbands.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c14">Belt of Incredible dexterity:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Your first choice for a belt, eventually, you want a Con/Dex multi boost.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c10">Glove of storing:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Store that important metamagic rod and bring it forth as a free action.&nbsp; Not that you can&#39;t afford a move-equivalent, but you may want to use that for something else...</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c14">Cloak of resistance:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;A staple item, and very handy to have.&nbsp; Missing saving throws can really suck.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c14">Tome of clear thought:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Obviously nothing you are getting right away, but someday...note that when and if you get Wish - it&#39;s actually slightly cheaper to use than getting this item.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c14">Amulet of Natural Armor:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Another staple, naturally a good way to stack AC bonuses.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c13">Crystal Ball:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Rather than getting the 50 different scry spell options, get one of these instead</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c10 c12">Robe of the Archmagi:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Overrated.&nbsp; The +5 AC is barely better than mage armor, and you likely already have spell penetration.&nbsp; SR is not all it cracked up to be, trust me.&nbsp; Leaving you with a resistance bonus.&nbsp; Just get a Cloak of resistance.</span></p><h2 class="c7"><span class="c16">I tried: </span><span class="c5">Names like Bigby, Evard, and Mordenkainen are intellectual property of D&amp;D and therefore not subject to the OGL, which is why in Pathfinder you have spells like &quot;Forceful Hand&quot; and &quot;Black Tentacles&quot;.&nbsp; I&#39;ve been playing D&amp;D way too long to give up the traditional titles, so I slip into calling the &quot;Hand&quot; spells &quot;Bigby&#39;s Hand&quot; spells etc on multiple occasions.&nbsp; That&#39;s OK, you know what I mean right?&nbsp; At my gaming table, we&#39;ll continue to use the traditional names playing Pathfinder without guilt, and we may even face a Beholder or two just to rub it in.</span></h2><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c28 c30">Illusion Spells and &quot;Interaction&quot;:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;A lot of Illusion spells specifically only allow a save if the illusion is interacted with.&nbsp; This seems faily self-explanitory for something like an illusionary wall.&nbsp; If you touch the wall, you&#39;ve interacted with it, and therefore get a saving throw.&nbsp; How about if the illusion contains sound?&nbsp; If you make an illusion of a roaring dragon, does hearing the roar constitute interaction?&nbsp; This is when the rules become vague.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span>I&#39;m not aware of any Pathfinder Specific clarification, but Skip Williams did do a clarification for 3.5 that makes a lot of sense, and I would recommend that using Pathfinder, the same guidelines be used.&nbsp; The web article I refer to is located </span><span class="c11 c24"><a class="c1" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x%3Ddnd/rg/20060221a&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611518834762000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1fpoZuAq-JLQveW4ajBjzs">HERE</a></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">To sum up, he says that a saving throw for an illusion that requires interaction to provide a saving throw, should require either touching or studying the illusion, and that should, under most circumstances, require an action.&nbsp; So for the Dragon example, if a character is to use a standard action to either study the image, or carefully listen to the roar, or carefully smell the dragon&#39;s stench, etc, then a saving throw is recieved.&nbsp; Just hearing the roar by itself however, does not constitute &quot;interaction&quot;.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">This definition makes sense, and is as close to official as I think we can hope for, so my ratings will assume that your DM uses this criteria.&nbsp;

Also note that the eyes are small and hard to spot, but they aren&#39;t invisible or invulnerable.&nbsp; You don&#39;t see through the eyes, they have to report back to you.&nbsp; You don&#39;t direct the eyes, you must give them instructions.&nbsp;

You can also convert ceilings to mud for a really unimpressive blast effect if you like which is technically multi-threat since it leaves a 5&#39; deep mud-puddle around the victims, Ref save for 1/2.</span></p><h3 class="c3"><span class="c5">Universal</span></h3><p class="c7"><span class="c11 c8 c10"><a class="c1" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/permanency.html%23permanency&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611518834884000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1QvhLxyptSP3_G4sjnhb0c">Permanency</a></span><span class="c8">:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Not something you are going to memorize, but gives a few decent ways to spend your coin.&nbsp;

Finally, I like it as a way to increase range, the range of the projected image is medium - so deliver touch, short range, or cone spells all at medium range, or double the range of a medium range spell.&nbsp;

I can see massive value in that.&nbsp; However, how many creatures/NPC&#39;s of super high level do you know to duplicate?&nbsp; The more obvious and intended use is to create a double of a creature or NPC under your control to assume their identity.&nbsp;

If I want 2 I can bind 2.&nbsp; Gate is not bringing anything to the table worth the insane material component cost.&nbsp; Sorry.&nbsp; Throw your tomatoes now.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c11 c8 c10"><a class="c1" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/refuge.html%23refuge&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611518834946000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1QkOAw-dLU8y4lUoFmzkVM">Refuge</a></span><span class="c8">:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;You create an item (for 1,500 gp), that you give to someone.&nbsp;

If you are playing core pathfinder, the value of never being flat footed is OK, but not worth a 9th level spell (in 3.5 it was different, Foresight + Celerity meant that you couldn&#39;t lose initiative - no longer).</span></p><h3 class="c3"><span class="c5">Enchantment</span></h3><p class="c6"><span class="c11 c8 c10"><a class="c1" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/dominateMonster.html%23dominate-monster&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611518834949000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2Jw1bUXkKLuJ4sziNo2f37">Dominate Monster</a></span><span class="c8">:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;As the dominate person spell, except it works on any creature.&nbsp;
