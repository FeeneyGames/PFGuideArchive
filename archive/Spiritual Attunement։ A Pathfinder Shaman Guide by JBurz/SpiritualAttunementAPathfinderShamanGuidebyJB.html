class="c9"><span class="c3 c6">This guide will cover the Shaman class from the Advanced Class Guide for the Pathfinder RPG. It will only cover options published by Paizo, but aims to cover all such options.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3 c6">The Shaman is listed as a mix of the Oracle and Witch classes, which is fairly accurate. You inherit a modified version of the Witch&rsquo;s hexes and familiar, while you gain access to a modified Mystery/Revelation class feature from the Oracle in a slightly different way.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3 c6">After many late-night hours spent building a shaman for my weekly Pathfinder game (and nearly making one for Gen Con 2014 using my GM credit), I realized no guide for the class had been posted. Since I feel I owe a lot to the community generally, I decided to put together this guide.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><h1 class="c12" id="h.s6or2lf4f17l"><span class="c23 c6">Why play a Shaman?</span></h1><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3 c6">One word: versatility.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>Yes, you&rsquo;ll probably be focused on a particular role, and for your first few levels, you&rsquo;ll be mostly doing that. But after you get your Wandering Spirit and Wandering Hex class features, you get to choose what </span><span class="c20">else</span><span class="c3 c6">&nbsp;you want to do that day.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>You can be a great healer who can debuff when healing is not needed, or a blaster who can spontaneously cast Summon Nature&rsquo;s Ally if their prepared spells aren&rsquo;t good options. You can build a debuffer capable of throwing out Channel Positive Energy to either top off their allies or hurting undead. You can be a melee shaman who makes their enemy vulnerable to fire and throws a Fireball before wading into the melee with a </span><span class="c20">flaming</span><span class="c3 c6">&nbsp;weapon. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3 c6">And, the next day, you can decide that you want to change your secondary role to better fit the needs of the party.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3 c6">There&rsquo;s a ton of possibilities with this class and you can get access to basically all of the Spirit Hexes if you want, which is one of the reasons that I find it so intriguing.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3 c6">As with any class that has versatility, knowledge is power. If you know what you&rsquo;re going up against, you can prepare for it. You want to consider your choices carefully when you prepare your spells each day.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>My hope is that this guide will show you some of the possibilities that the class offers, so that you can build something that you&rsquo;ll have fun playing and find some of the better options when you prepare your spells and your Wandering Spirit.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">Rankings</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3 c6">To help you determine my opinion on a class feature or option at a glance, I&rsquo;ll be using the following ranking system, common in the RPG guide community:</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c7 c8">Red:</span><span class="c3 c6">&nbsp;An extremely poor choice, extremely situational, or generally not recommended.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c7 c33">Orange:</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c6">Below-average choice, somewhat situational, but may have a place in niche builds or for certain situations.. </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Green:</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c6">A good choice, useful or recommended for many builds.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c21 c7">Blue:</span><span class="c21">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c6">A great choice, extremely useful for many builds.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><h1 class="c12" id="h.qxyjqw49f7wl"><span class="c23 c6">Shaman combat roles</span></h1><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3 c6">The name of the Shaman game is versatility, but most will likely have a primary focus. Given the diversity of available spirits, a Shaman can fill a number of primary roles.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c21 c7">Debuffer: </span><span class="c3 c6">Although shaman never gain access to Major and Grand Hexes, and don&rsquo;t qualify for feats like Split Hex, they can still make for potent debuffers. They get Evil Eye, and in the right setup can amplify their party&rsquo;s damage significantly. They can also gain access to one Witch Hex - Slumber is a great candidate for debuffers. Many spells on the Shaman list help with debuffing, as well.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c21 c7">Healer:</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c6">A shaman using the Life Spirit can be an extremely effective healer through the addition of Channel Energy, and there&rsquo;s an archetype (Witch Doctor) that gives them another pool of channels, admittedly at Shaman level minus three. Certain races of Shaman can add Cleric spells to their list using their favored class bonus. All of the above can be accomplished without sacrificing too much debuffing or buffing capability, so they have options if healing isn&rsquo;t needed. Using Channel Energy to heal in combat is feat-intensive, however.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Buffer: </span><span class="c3 c6">A shaman is capable of buffing her allies, especially through the use of hexes. The downside to being a primary shaman buffer is that the Spirit-specific buffs are pretty situational, and arguably the best buffing Spirit ability, Battle Spirit, is extremely unclear about how it is activated/maintained and is a common bonus type. Your spell list does have a number of good buff spells, but some of the best ones are on the Cleric spell list and will have to be acquired using a favored class bonus. This just isn&rsquo;t the Shaman&rsquo;s best focus area by default, but this role can be blue with support from the Cleric list via FCB.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Blaster: </span><span class="c3 c6">A shaman can be built to blast, but you lose some versatility in doing so. The upside is that the standard shaman blasting setup, which uses Flame spirit, brings its own vulnerability debuff to the party, and fire damage is pretty common among player characters. On the other hand, having most of your effective blasting arsenal come from one element means problems with resistances unless you spring for an elemental metamagic rod or utilize Lore spirit as your wandering spirit. At low levels, blasting is very rough.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Melee fighter: </span><span class="c3 c6">A shaman can be built to fight in melee, although they will likely need to get their weapon proficiencies from somewhere. The Mammoth and Battle spirits offer a number of options for getting into the mix, and you already have medium armor proficiency. On top of that, many of the Spirit Abilities grant melee touch attacks, which a melee character can safely take advantage of. Still, you don&rsquo;t have as many feats as a fighter, you have a medium BAB progression, and your physical saves are bad. At best, you&rsquo;re still a support melee character, not a primary damage dealer.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Minion master / Necromancer: </span><span class="c3 c6">The Bones spirit offers support for it, but there are better options in other classes if this is your primary focus. There&rsquo;s no way to channel negative energy in-class, either, so that further complicates things.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><h1 class="c12" id="h.kymtjorcoh4"><span class="c23 c6">Shaman Roles, Out-Of-Combat</span></h1><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>Under construction</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><h1 class="c12" id="h.bkh7dul3xtnf"><span class="c23 c6">Ability scores</span></h1><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c7 c8">Strength </span><span>can normally be your dump stat, except if you plan to make use of melee touch attacks granted by spirits, or if you&rsquo;re going the </span><span class="c21 c7">melee fighter route</span><span class="c3 c6">. Just watch your carrying capacity!</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Dexterity </span><span class="c3 c6">is mostly for AC, Reflex saves and initiative here, unless you&rsquo;re going the blasting route. Even then, there aren&rsquo;t a ton of ranged touch attack spells on the Shaman list by default.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Consti</span><span class="c21 c7">tution</span><span class="c3 c6">&rsquo;s importance depends greatly on what you&rsquo;ll be doing. If you picked up Shield Other from the Cleric spell list, or you fight in melee a lot you won&rsquo;t want to skimp on HP. On the other hand, if you spend a lot of time flying above the ground...</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Intelligence</span><span class="c7 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c6">is another stat that you either need, or you don&rsquo;t. One of the hexes from Lore spirit (Arcane Enlightenment) lets you grab spells from the Wizard/Sorcerer spell list, but you need Int to cast them still (even though they use Wisdom for DC and whatnot). On the other hand, the Shaman class skills aren&rsquo;t great, and another Lore spirit hex lets you use Wisdom for Int-based skills.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c21 c7">Wisdom </span><span>is the primary spellcasting attribute for Shaman and also determines most Hex DCs, so it will be the primary attribute for many builds. </span><span class="c0 c3">Melee shaman can tone this back a bit.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Charisma</span><span>&nbsp;affects the duration, frequency or effectiveness of many spirit-specific hexes. Shaman acting as </span><span class="c21 c7">primary healers will likely consider this blue</span><span class="c21">&nbsp;</span><span>and will compromise on their Wisdom score slightly. </span><span class="c3 c5">Melee shaman may decide to compromise on this as well.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><h1 class="c12" id="h.kopqsiklv1ef"><span class="c23 c6">Race Selection</span></h1><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3 c6">As of the writing of this guide, there are no Paizo race-specific archetypes for Shaman.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c21 c7">Human: </span><span class="c3 c6">It likely comes as a surprise to no one, but humans make great shaman. The extra feat is pretty useful, you get to put your +2 bonus where you want, and the extra skill point will make you feel better about dumping your Intelligence, if you go that route. You can also add Cleric spells to your spell list via your favored class bonus, which is a great option to diversify or specialize your character.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c21 c7">Aasimar: </span><span class="c3 c6">You get bonuses to the class&rsquo;s (likely) two primary scores, you get good resistances and a very-useful spell-like ability, you get Darkvision 60ft, good skill bonuses... I could go on. The best part is that you can still qualify for the Human favored class bonus via the Scion of Humanity alternate racial trait. If you don&rsquo;t need the human bonus feat and this is an option, you should strongly consider it. Melee shaman should consider the Angel- or Archon-blooded alternate racial heritages.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Half-Orc:</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c6">Has the same favored class bonus and flexible +2 attribute bonus as Human, along with Darkvision, which is good. Orc Ferocity can be useful (especially if you can heal yourself), but the weapon proficiencies and the skill bonus to Intimidate are underwhelming for most Shaman. Thematically appropriate for many Shaman, perhaps, but not your best choice. A decent melee shaman choice. Taking alternate racial traits and the Fate&rsquo;s Favored traits can net you +2 to all saves, however, potentially pushing this into blue territory.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Tiefling: </span><span>The basic attribute bonuses are terrible, but the alternate racial heritages can give you some good options (Foulspawn, Pitborn and Motherless are good, depending on your focus), but none of the attribute options are perfect or anything. They don&rsquo;t have a race-specific favored class bonus, so that&rsquo;s a minus. The resistances are good, the Darkvision is good, and the spell-like abilities and skill modifiers vary from useful to worthless. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Gnome: </span><span class="c3 c6">A bonus to Constitution and Charisma is pretty solid, and as long as you&rsquo;re not planning on hitting anyone with a weapon, small size is a largely a boon. Some of the alternate racial traits are potentially useful, but not mind-blowing. The penalty to strength puts you into potential &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t carry anything at all&rdquo; territory, and the movement speed reduction is painful. The favored class bonus is decent.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Half-Elf:</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c6">Has the same favored class bonus and flexible +2 attribute bonus as Human. Skill focus can be useful, but let&rsquo;s be honest, you&rsquo;re probably putting it in Perception. The alternate racial trait that turns skill focus into weapon proficiency is an option for melee shaman.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Dwarf:</span><span class="c26">&nbsp;</span><span>The penalty to Charisma hurts, but isn&rsquo;t necessarily fatal, as you get bonuses to Wisdom and Con. Dwarves have a great array of racial traits. The favored class bonus is probably the worst one as of this writing, but the weapon proficiencies are </span><span class="c0">decent for a melee shaman</span><span class="c3 c6">.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Halfling: </span><span class="c3 c6">Bonus to Charisma is good, Dexterity is not amazing. The favored class bonus is pretty sub-par and many of the racial traits aren&rsquo;t useful. Again, penalty to Strength can put you into &ldquo;wet noodle&rdquo; territory. They have generally solid racial traits and can pick up another debuff via Halfling Jinx.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Tengu:</span><span class="c3 c6">&nbsp;Penalty to Con hurts, but you do get a bonus to Wisdom and Dexterity. A potential option for a Dex-based melee shaman, since you get proficiencies baked into the race.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Nagaji: </span><span class="c3 c6">Maybe not a bad idea for a melee shaman, but you could do better elsewhere. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c7 c8">Elf: </span><span class="c3 c6">No bonus to primary stats, the weapon proficiencies are largely wasted, and a penalty to CON. Ouch. Elven Magic is numerically equivalent to a free Spell Penetration feat, which might be good for some Shaman. The favored class bonus is actually interesting, but it doesn&rsquo;t salvage the rest of this mess.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c7 c8">Kitsune: </span><span class="c3 c6">Same stat arrangement as halfling but without the small size or solid racial traits, no unique favored class bonus. Kitsune Magic could potentially be useful if you find yourself casting a lot of enchantment spells, I guess?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c7 c8">Wayang: </span><span class="c3 c6">Bonuses to Dex and Int, penalty to Wisdom, irrelevant racial traits.

I&rsquo;ve tried to point out when a spell is a lot better for one strategy than another, especially if it isn&rsquo;t obvious to the reader.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3 c6">Additionally, because Shaman can bring their own debuffs with Evil Eye and Misfortune, they have a better chance than most other casters (besides Witch) at landing &ldquo;save-or-suck/die&rdquo; spells. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>Finally, it&rsquo;s worth keeping in mind that the Shaman spell list is pretty limited in terms of </span><span class="c20">depth</span><span>, but not necessarily in terms of </span><span class="c20">variety</span><span class="c3 c6">. They get a lot of situational druid spells and they get spells like Charm Person and Enthrall for dealing with diplomatic situations. They get some rudimentary buff spells as well as rudimentary battlefield control. They get spells to help scout.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3 c6">Once you decide what your role will be, if you have access to the Human, Half-Orc or Half-Elf favored class bonus, you can flesh out your spell list by selecting Cleric spells. While I may point to specific options in the future, I recommend looking at one of the many Cleric guides for recommendation on spell selection from their list as many Clerics will fill similar roles to some Shaman (with the likely exception of Blasters, whom are likely easier to do in the Shaman class).</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.ic09xuwtcyv"><span class="c19 c7">Level 0 (Cantrips):</span></h2><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c7 c8">Arcane Mark:</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c6">Actually kinda weird that Shaman get this spell.

You can get constant guidance in-combat without spending your own actions, and it gets a bunch of skills that you may have ranks in as class skills. Share Will is okay, but your save is already fine on its own.

This keeps Deliver Touch Spells, so it&rsquo;s viable if you like that part of the standard familiar package. In some ways, if your familiar is not likely to be attacked vs. AC, this could be a valuable addition.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">Familiar Archetypes (Animal Archive):</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">Infiltrator:</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">Pilferer:</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">Valet:</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">A word on familiar ranking:</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3 c6">Since most familiars (minus some archetypes) use your skill ranks, and Shaman are likely to put points in things like perception, a low base skill modifier for that is not terrible - but on the flip side, you probably aren&rsquo;t investing points in stuff like stealth, so it&rsquo;s a boon if they have that for themselves already.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">Standard familiar options:</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c20">Below are the options available to you by default, without taking Improved Familiar. They are ranked based on their performance for their best role.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Archaeopteryx: </span><span class="c3 c13">+2 bonus on Reflex saves. The weak flier part can be limiting. Decent option for delivering touch spells.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Arctic fox: </span><span class="c3 c13">+2 bonus on Reflex saves. Decent move speed, and it comes with Scent. Makes a decent scout, or a good mauler due to its decent strength. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c21 c7">Arctic hare:</span><span class="c31 c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c13">&nbsp;+4 bonus on initiative checks. Unless you picked up Noble Scion or Improved Initiative you likely have a bad initiative mod, and this is a good way to mitigate the weakness. Decent scout as well, assuming you invested in Perception.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Arctic tern:</span><span class="c31 c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c13">+3 bonus on Fly checks. Besides the flying part, this is a weak option, and the bonus to Fly checks is lame.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Armadillo:</span><span class="c26">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c13">+1 natural armor to AC. This could maybe make a good Protector, but the rest of it, minus scent, &nbsp;is pretty bad.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Bat: </span><span class="c3 c13">+3 bonus on Fly checks is still not good, but you get Blindsense 20ft and a decent Perception.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Blue-ringed octopus:</span><span class="c3 c13">&nbsp;+3 bonus on Swim checks. The bonus to swim is situational, but with the inclusion of Mauler archetype (and the availability of Aquarium Balls to keep it alive), the multiattack tentacle grabbing could get nasty. It actually has a land speed - the problem here is that you initially have no way to keep it out of its ball for long without it suffocating. Eventually you can use spells to let it breathe air.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Cat: </span><span class="c3 c13">+3 bonus on Stealth checks. You probably won&rsquo;t use the Stealth bonus, but it has scent, is a good scout on its own, and has an average move speed.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c7 c8">Chicken:</span><span class="c3 c13">&nbsp;+3 hit points. The HP bonus is really the best part about this creature. I want to rate this higher, because anyone who chooses a chicken familiar is probably a cool guy.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c21 c7">Dinosaur, compsognathus: </span><span class="c3 c13">+4 bonus on initiative checks. Has a decent land speed with scent, low-light vision to boot. This thing is also a good mauler, if you go that route. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Dodo: &nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c13">+4 bonus on initiative checks. Worse than the hare and compy in basically every way, but still gives a delicious initiative bonus. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c7 c8">Dolphin, popoto: </span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c13">+3 bonus on Swim checks. No land speed, the need to breathe air and the small size makes this pretty situational as it is. The rest of its abilities, besides Blindsight, are weak. It could maul, but you have better options, even in the aquatic realm.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Donkey rat: </span><span class="c3 c13">&nbsp;+2 bonus on Fortitude saves. Bonus to fort is good, and the rat makes a good scout due to good stealth, perception, low-light vision and scent. Not a combatant.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c7 c8">Dwarf caiman: </span><span class="c3 c13">+3 bonus on Stealth checks. Good stealth, but bad perception and little else of interest. You probably won&rsquo;t use the skill bonus.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Ermine: </span><span class="c3 c13">+2 bonus on Reflex saves. A good scout and the master bonus helps your weakest save. Uses weasel stats but adds +4 to Stealth to blend into snow.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c7 c8">Flying squirrel:</span><span class="c3 c13">&nbsp;+3 bonus on Fly checks. The skill bonus is not good, not a great scout, poor flying and far too weak to be a mauler.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Fox:</span><span class="c3 c13">&nbsp;+2 bonus on Reflex saves. Decent move speed, and it comes with Scent. Makes a decent scout, or a good mauler due to its decent strength. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Giant isopod: </span><span class="c3 c13">+1 natural armor bonus to AC. I can see some use for this, but it&rsquo;s a poor scout, poor mauler, and has limited mobility. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Goat:</span><span class="c21 c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c13">+3 bonus on Survival checks. The skill bonus is alright and it makes a poor scout, but it has relatively high strength (for a familiar) and decent land mobility. If you&rsquo;re choosing some other archetype besides mauler, this guy comes with some built-in combat capability. Plus, it&rsquo;s a goat - the jokes write themselves.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c21 c7">Greensting scorpion: </span><span class="c3 c13">+4 bonus on initiative checks. Probably relegated to scout duty only, but with Darkvision, it&rsquo;s good at that. Strength is too low to maul. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Hawk:</span><span class="c3 c13">&nbsp;+3 bonus on sight-based &nbsp;and opposed Perception checks in bright light. It has the flight speed and perception, along with a decent stealth, to act as a scout or deliver spells. Mauling is possible. Same as osprey, which grants a bonus to Survival instead, and Snail Kite, which grants a bonus to Fly.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Hedgehog:</span><span class="c3 c13">&nbsp;+2 bonus on Will saves. You probably don&rsquo;t need the bonus to Will and the creature is slow. It has great stealth due to its size, but has a poor perception.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">House centipede:</span><span class="c31 c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c13">+3 bonus on Stealth checks. The bonus to stealth checks isn&rsquo;t great, but this thing is hard to see, has a decent perception, and has a fast climb speed. Decent scout.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Ioun wyrd:</span><span class="c3 c13">&nbsp;+1 natural armor bonus to AC. Has a fly speed, construct traits and blindsight. Can also share Ioun stones with its master within 30 feet. An interesting option.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c7 c8">Marine iguana:</span><span class="c31 c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c13">+3 bonus on Swim checks. Uses Dwarf Caiman stats, and at least the caiman gives you a stealth bonus.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c7 c8">Kakapo: </span><span class="c3 c13">+3 bonus on Climb checks. Horrible.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">King crab: </span><span class="c3 c13">+2 bonus on CMB checks to start and maintain a grapple. You will likely not use this skill bonus unless you use Shapeshifting. However, with the extra strength from changing to medium, this guy can make a decent mauler.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c7 c8">Koala: </span><span class="c3 c13">+3 bonus on Climb checks. Bad bonus, bad speed, no real reason to choose this.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c7 c8">Lemming:</span><span class="c31 c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c13">+2 bonus on Fortitude saves. There are better places to get the Fort bonus. The rest of this creature is a wash.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Leopard slug: </span><span class="c3 c13">&nbsp;+3 bonus on Climb checks. Bad bonus. The only reason this isn&rsquo;t red is the darkvision, and the fact that it can get into basically anywhere.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Lizard: </span><span class="c3 c13">+3 bonus on Climb checks. Good stealth, climb speed, a bit slow.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Mole: </span><span class="c3 c13">&nbsp;+3 bonus on smell-, &nbsp;taste-, and touch-based Perception checks. A burrow speed and decent perception are intriguing, but there&rsquo;s not much else there.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Mongoose:</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c13">+2 bonus on Fortitude saves. Decent scout, bonus to fort is good, and it has scent and low-light. Uses the Weasel&rsquo;s stats, and the weasel&rsquo;s master bonus is +2 Reflex.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Monkey:</span><span class="c26">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c13">+3 bonus on Acrobatics checks. Not a great choice because the skill bonus is likely wasted, and the monkey isn&rsquo;t sneaky enough to act as a scout. Strength is too low for a mauler.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Osprey: </span><span class="c3 c13">+3 bonus on Survival checks. Uses Hawk stats, so choose between survival checks or sight-based perception checks in bright light. Mauling is possible. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c7 c8">Otter:</span><span class="c3 c13">&nbsp;+3 bonus on Swim checks. There&rsquo;s not a lot here.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c21 c7">Owl:</span><span class="c3 c13">&nbsp;+3 bonus on sight-based and opposed Perception checks in shadows or darkness. Great scout since it has huge perception and stealth bonuses. This thing could be a mauler, even.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Parrot:</span><span class="c3 c13">&nbsp;+3 bonus on Linguistics checks. If you want a flying familiar, I would direct you to the hawk/osprey instead of this.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Peacock:</span><span class="c3 c13">&nbsp;+3 bonus on Intimidate. Good for demoralize builds, and having your familiar demoralize everything in sight is actually not bad.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Penguin: </span><span class="c3 c13">+3 bonus on Swim checks. This is all pretty situational.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Petrifern:</span><span class="c3 c13">&nbsp;+1 natural armor bonus. Blindsight is okay, and petrifying gives it options to &ldquo;full defend&rdquo; when it isn&rsquo;t needed for delivering touch spells. Now you can be like Jean Reno&rsquo;s character in The Professional and carry a plant around.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Petromin:</span><span class="c31 c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c13">+3 bonus on Stealth checks. It can shed light as a candle, has limited flight, and is invisible to creatures using only darkvision. This one is unique, but probably not mechanically better than some of your other options. Plus, the master bonus isn&rsquo;t great.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Pig: </span><span class="c3 c13">+3 bonus on Diplomacy checks. Better skill bonus than the goat, plus it gets scent. The downside is the strength is slightly worse, and it lacks the goat&rsquo;s climb/acrobatics and nimble moves. The other downside is that your familiar could hog the spotlight.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c7 c8">Platypus: </span><span class="c3 c13">+3 bonus on Swim checks. Tons of situational abilities, not a good scout, an underwater-only lifesense and a poison that deals nonlethal damage. Pass, even for an aquatic campaign.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Ptarmigan:</span><span class="c31 c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c13">+3 bonus on Stealth checks. The master bonus is probably not helping you make a check at higher levels. Has a decent fly speed, stealth and perception.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c21 c7">Pterosaur, rhamphorhynchus:</span><span class="c21">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c13">+2 bonus on initiative checks. You get a good fly speed and good scouting ability. The interesting part for this familiar is using its Sudden Swoop to deliver melee touch attacks without provoking attacks of opportunity.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Pufferfish:</span><span class="c3 c13">&nbsp;+2 bonus on Fortitude saves. The bonus to fort is good, but the poison is pretty situational and it doesn&rsquo;t offer much else besides - plus, it&rsquo;s aquatic.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Puffin:</span><span class="c31 c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c13">+3 bonus on Swim checks. 40ft. fly speed and decent stealth and perception. Still, you can do better elsewhere and the master bonus is likely wasted.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Raccoon: </span><span class="c3 c13">&nbsp;+3 bonus on Sleight of &nbsp;Hand checks. This is a decent mauler, but there are better options. There are better options for scouts and the skill bonus is probably wasted completely on you.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Rat: </span><span class="c3 c13">&nbsp;+2 bonus on Fortitude saves. Good scout, but very slow - even if that lack of speed is offset by a climb and swim speed. Fort bonus is nice. Because it isn&rsquo;t really fast enough to deliver spells, it&rsquo;s really best as a dedicated scout.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Raven: </span><span class="c3 c13">&nbsp;+3 bonus on Appraise checks. The skill bonus is almost definitely wasted. There are better scouts, and there are better options to deliver touch spells. However, since it can speak a language of its master&rsquo;s choice, your GM may rule that it can make Use Magic Device checks to activate wands. Check with your GM.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Sea krait: </span><span class="c3 c13">&nbsp;+2 bonus on Fortitude saves. Has the same stats as the Viper. If all you will use your familiar for is dedicated scouting across a variety of terrain (including water), this is a great option. It is somewhat less sneaky than the rat, but it has a better perception and is faster.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c7 c8">Seal: </span><span class="c3 c13">+3 bonus on Swim checks. It has to breathe air, is slow on land, and has no other really redeeming features that you can&rsquo;t get elsewhere. Insert lyrics to &ldquo;Kiss From A Rose&rdquo; here.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Skunk:</span><span class="c3 c13">&nbsp;+2 bonus on Fortitude saves. The musk spray ability doesn&rsquo;t scale with HD, but they&rsquo;re still sickened for 1d4 rounds on a save - not bad. Has a decent perception and stealth with average land speed. If you want a scout with a little something extra, you could do worse.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Sloth:</span><span class="c3 c13">&nbsp;+3 bonus on Climb checks. This thing is so slow that it&rsquo;s practically glacial, but it does have a great stealth. The skill bonus is probably not very helpful.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c21 c7">Snowy owl: </span><span class="c3 c13">+3 bonus on sight-based &nbsp;checks in shadows or darkness. Same as Owl, but with a +4 stealth bonus to hiding in snowy environments.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Scarlet spider:</span><span class="c3 c13">&nbsp;+3 bonus on Climb checks. Even with the poor skill bonus, this thing is average speed, has 60ft darkvision and a great stealth and climb modifier. Good scout material.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Snail kite:</span><span class="c3 c13">&nbsp;+3 bonus on Fly checks. Same as Hawk.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c7 c8">Squirrel:</span><span class="c3 c13">&nbsp;+3 bonus on Sleight of &nbsp;Hand checks. There are better options for scouts that are both faster and sneakier - even with the diminutive size.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Thrush: </span><span class="c3 c13">&nbsp;+3 bonus on Diplomacy checks. Speaks a language like the Raven, so the caveat from before regarding UMD applies. The skill bonus is more useful here, though.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c15 c26"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Toad:</span><span class="c26">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c13">+3 hit points. If you want the HP bonus, take this over the Chicken. Still, this thing is really slow.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c7 c8">Toucan:</span><span class="c3 c13">&nbsp;+3 bonus on Diplomacy checks (can&rsquo;t speak). Uses the raven&rsquo;s stats, loses a language, grants a different skill bonus. Just take the Thrush instead.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Tuatara:</span><span class="c31">&nbsp;+3 bonus on Survival checks. It </span><span class="c20 c31">does</span><span class="c3 c13">&nbsp;have Darkvision 60ft., but it&rsquo;s otherwise slow-ish. Has some skills you don&rsquo;t normally see on familiars. Worth a look, if nothing else.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c7 c8">Turtle: </span><span class="c3 c13">+1 natural armor bonus to AC. Too slow, not very stealthy and not very perceptive. Not a great option for any familiar role. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c7 c8">Snapping turtle: </span><span class="c3 c13">+2 bonus on Fortitude saves. There are better ways to get the Fort bonus.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Viper: </span><span class="c3 c13">+3 bonus on Bluff checks. Has the same stats as the Sea Krait. If all you will use your familiar for is dedicated scouting across a variety of terrain (including water), this is a great option. It is somewhat less sneaky than the rat, but it has a better perception and is faster. The skill bonus could be useful, since you probably have a decent charisma.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Wallaby: </span><span class="c3 c13">+3 bonus on Acrobatics checks. This is a mauler-only candidate, even at Small size to start. Faster than the goat and pig, and it has Acrobatics. Unfortunately, you probably didn&rsquo;t take ranks in it, so the master bonus isn&rsquo;t great.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c13"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Weasel: </span><span class="c3 c13">+2 bonus on Reflex saves. This is probably your weakest save, so using your familiar to shore it up is a good idea. Decent scout, bonus to fort is good, and it has scent and low-light. Shares stats with the Mongoose, which gives +2 Fort.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">Improved Familiar options:</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3 c6">The use of the Improved Familiar feat opens up some new options for Shaman. I&rsquo;ve put the required caster level and the creature&rsquo;s alignment in parentheses for you. The feat has been confirmed as legal for Shaman.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Aeon, Paracletus (7th, N): </span><span>The aura is pretty situational, because the Aeon can only exclude one creature (probably you, if it&rsquo;s the harmful version of the aura). Casting Commune once per week could be really great, depending on your GM. This could make a good sage, and the racial bonus to Knowledge skills could be useful if you&rsquo;ve placed points there.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c21 c7">Agathion, Silvanshee (7th, NG):</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c6">Used to be straight overpowered, until the Lay on Hands was specified to always be as a 2nd-level paladin. Still good due to the fast movement speed, good mobility, great saves and great stealth/perception. Heroic Strength and pounce could mean a formidable mauler once per day. Truespeech and Speak With Animals can be very handy. Gets Commune one a week to top it off.

The second part is what you want it for, since there&rsquo;s no save. But enemies that heal are not common enough for this to be useful all the time. If you know your opposition, this could serve you well as a wandering hex, or could be picked up via Spirit Talker.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9 c10"><span class="c7 c8">Eyes of Battle: </span><span class="c3 c6">This has uses, but by the time that invisibility becomes a big problem, there are numerous ways for magic users to get rid of it - although Shaman are not typically one of them. There are also numerous non-magical ways to negate invisibility. The second part is for ranged shaman, I guess? Pass.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9 c10"><span class="c0">Hampering Hex: </span><span class="c3 c6">Battle spirit, you tease - finally, something worth taking. Now, you can&rsquo;t extend this with Chant, but it does stack with Evil Eye. Whether or not the penalty to CMD matters depends strictly on your group.

Is it a standard action to activate, and then a free action to maintain? Is it a standard action every round? The attack bonus doesn&rsquo;t stack with Bless, but does eventually outscale it. It stacks fully with a Bard&rsquo;s Inspire Courage. &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">If your GM makes you spend a standard every round, you should probably just do something else. </span><span class="c3 c6">Hoping for some errata here soon.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3 c21 c7">Greater Spirit Ability:</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span>This is one of the reasons you decided to be a melee shaman. You can use inquisitors as a point of comparison - they get this three levels earlier, but for nowhere near as long (depending on your Cha modifier). Also, you need to be wielding the weapon to use this, but unlike the inquisitor, it stacks with an existing bane property of the same type, </span><span class="c20">and</span><span class="c3 c6">&nbsp;there&rsquo;s no clause that says you can&rsquo;t then hand the weapon off to someone else.

A lot of &nbsp;enemy types make use of negative energy effects, and the untyped bonus to saves against death and energy drain effects you get later on are also great. A good pickup for Wandering Hex or Spirit Talker, but not a great everyday hex. At 16th, this is a good way to ignore negative level penalties.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9 c10"><span class="c0">Fearful Gaze: </span><span class="c3 c6">At low levels, it&rsquo;s probably easier to use Intimidate to create the Shaken condition.

The scaling at 8th and 16th prevents this from falling into red territory.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3 c5">Spirit Animal:</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c5"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3 c6">Resistance to a comparatively rare form of damage and a glow that will likely give away your spirit animal&rsquo;s position.

Truthfully, you already have spells to do that.

For Shaman, they are one method among many. Still, your feats can greatly expand your capabilities, or just make you better at what you&rsquo;re already doing.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3 c6">I obviously can&rsquo;t list every feat, but will try to hit the common options, traps, and interesting choices. </span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.bpifn2q6n2jw"><span class="c19 c7">Hex Feats</span></h2><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3 c6">Because Hexes are a big part of the class, grabbing feats to improve their effects or expand your selection is tempting. However, bear in mind that Shaman do not get the Hex class feature until level 2 - so you don&rsquo;t qualify until then. I&rsquo;ve put feats that affect hexes in their own section, though they are technically &ldquo;General Feats.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c21 c7">Accursed Hex:</span><span class="c3 c6">&nbsp;A great choice for the debuffer, especially if you grabbed a save-or-suck Hex like Slumber or Misfortune. Less useful if debuffing isn&rsquo;t your primary role.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Amplified Hex:</span><span class="c3 c6">&nbsp;A tempting option to make your Hexes even more difficult to resist or to expand your range early in a confrontation where some maneuvering is required. Depending on your role, you may or may not have the spells available to continue to use this throughout the day ... and at low levels, you&rsquo;re limited.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Extra Hex:</span><span>&nbsp;As written, this feat seems to indicate that the Shaman must select a Hex from their spirit (and, as a result, can&rsquo;t take Hexes from the list of generic Shaman hexes). You can see some discussion about this </span><span class="c28 c24"><a class="c2" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://paizo.com/threads/rzs2rxhh%26page%3D2?Spiritual-Attunement-A-Pathfinder-Shaman-Guide%2361&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117521535000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2PuSBuuD_uZPmtM5-uwbeK">in</a></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c28 c24"><a class="c2" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://paizo.com/threads/rzs2rxhh%26page%3D2?Spiritual-Attunement-A-Pathfinder-Shaman-Guide%2363&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117521535000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2F687Uh4Fdpk2cFbssIwGX">this</a></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c28 c24"><a class="c2" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://paizo.com/threads/rzs2rxhh%26page%3D2?Spiritual-Attunement-A-Pathfinder-Shaman-Guide%2367&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117521536000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0mWOHpEfhJVFcf4UdOFGgM">thread</a></span><span>. I believe the intent is to allow the selection of the generic hexes, and also think that the forthcoming errata will clarify this. For the moment, this is one of those gray areas of the class. I consider this </span><span class="c21 c7">blue</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c6">for most Shaman, assuming you can choose from the generic hexes.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Flexible Hex:</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c6">We heard you like flexibility! The value of this feat on any given day depends on your wandering spirit - some simply don&rsquo;t have a ton of great options. On the other hand, a few of them have several, and this lets you exploit that.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c15 c26"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Hex Strike:</span><span class="c3 c6">&nbsp;Not useful for most shaman, but there is spell support for making unarmed strikes in the shaman spell list. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c7 c8">Seeds of Doubt:</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c6">Extremely situational and could actually impede you personally. I wouldn&rsquo;t bother.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Spirit Talker:</span><span class="c21 c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c6">Expanding your versatility even more? This is a strong option. It offers tons of abilities for expanding further outside your established roles to support your party. The one-hour limitation can be bothersome, but you </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.v8c7j2sopfsa"><span class="c7 c19">General Feats</span></h2><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c21 c7">Ability Focus:</span><span class="c3 c6">&nbsp;Not PFS-legal, and your GM probably won&rsquo;t let you take it. But for a dedicated debuffer, this is great.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c7 c8">Alignment Channel: </span><span class="c3 c6">With no in-class access to negative energy, this is not great.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Armor Proficiency, Heavy: </span><span class="c3 c6">For melee shaman, this is an option to improve AC. For everyone else, who likely have mediocre or poor STR scores and want to retain mobility, this is likely to be ignored.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Augment Summoning: </span><span class="c3 c6">Summon Nature&rsquo;s Ally spells were added to the Shaman spell list, and I personally like summoning, it&rsquo;s just that Shaman has no particular advantage over any other class in this area.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Battle Cry:</span><span class="c3 c6">&nbsp;Gives you a good option for your swift action, even after the nerf. The save reroll is the real killer part of this feat, since it doesn&rsquo;t specify fear save, as was likely intended. You probably have a decent-to-great Charisma, unless you&rsquo;re a melee Shaman.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Bless Equipment:</span><span class="c26">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c6">I could potentially see a Witch Doctor picking this up, but it&rsquo;s just not that great.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Channel Endurance (Gozreh): </span><span class="c3 c6">This is a decent effect, but better ones definitely exist for channeling Shaman.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c7 c8">Channel Smite</span><span class="c7">: </span><span class="c3 c6">With no negative energy channeling in-class, this is very situational except in really undead-heavy campaigns. I&rsquo;d stay away from it.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Channeled Revival:</span><span class="c3 c6">&nbsp;Shaman with access to channels have a good chance of having access to Breath of Life once per day via Spirit Magic. Still, something to consider if your party is fragile.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Clarifying Channel (Shelyn): </span><span class="c3 c6">Shelyn is kind of a weird choice for a Shaman, but granting a reroll to charm/compulsion with a large bonus could be the difference between an ally standing around or rejoining the fight. Decent.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Cleave:</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c6">I&rsquo;m generally not a fan of this feat, and melee shaman have a limited amount of feats with better options. However, because Chant is a move action, if you&rsquo;re mixing hexes and melee attacks, you may not want to make a full attack anyways, so the feats that enable different Standard Action attacks are worth mentioning.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Combat Casting: </span><span class="c3 c6">Shaman eventually get pretty good options for mobility, but depending on the kind of opposition you face, this could come in handy. Most Shaman can safely pass.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Combat Expertise:</span><span class="c26">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c6">Melee Shaman are unlikely to meet the prerequisites for this feat given how spread out their stats will already be. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Combat Reflexes:</span><span class="c3 c6">&nbsp;Unless you&rsquo;re a DEX-based melee shaman, you probably won&rsquo;t be able to take full advantage of this feat. Even then, you&rsquo;ve already got a bunch of feats committed to being DEX-based.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Cornugon Smash: </span><span class="c3 c6">A key part of an Intimidate-based build for a melee shaman. Making people shaken and being able to toss around Evil Eye is a great way to make hard-headed opponents easier to hit, or make dangerous opponents weaker.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Curse of Vengeance (Calistria): </span><span class="c3 c6">I&rsquo;ve never liked stuff that gives you bonuses when you&rsquo;re basically out of the fight, but Bestow Curse is on our spell list, so this is something to consider if you want to make routine use of them. Still, I don&rsquo;t like it.<br></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Dazzling Display:</span><span class="c22">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c6">Another option for the melee Shaman who wants to Intimidate. Given the lack of full BAB, Weapon Focus is a good choice for melee Shaman anyways.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Deific Obedience: </span><span class="c3 c6">I don&rsquo;t like most of the bonuses, but it&rsquo;s something to think about.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Dervish Dance: </span><span class="c3 c6">It&rsquo;s an option for DEX-based melee Shaman, but you&rsquo;ll have to get the proficiency somewhere.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Destructive Dispel:</span><span class="c22">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c6">This is a great option if you do a lot of dispelling, and it feels like it fits well into the debuffing niche. Grab Cleromancy from the Cleric spell list to give yourself a good chance of landing the dispel. Obviously, only dispellers need apply.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Dispel Synergy: </span><span class="c3 c6">More dispel support. The -2 to saves only affects spells, but it&rsquo;s still great - especially if you have more magical artillery in the party.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Divine Barrier (Apsu): </span><span class="c3 c6">Being able to basically grant Improved Evasion to your party for the cost of one use of Channel Energy is good.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Divine Interference: </span><span class="c3 c15 c35">Note the restrictions, but it&rsquo;s still a good option for many different Shaman builds.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c35 c15"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Diviner&rsquo;s Delving: </span><span class="c3 c6">How useful this will be is determined partially by your GM, but the prerequisite is pretty harsh since most Shaman won&rsquo;t be specializing in this.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Dodge:</span><span class="c3 c6">&nbsp;Always an option to increase your AC.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c7 c8">Dreamed Secrets (Great Old Ones): </span><span class="c3 c6">You have a far easier and less risky way to gain access to Wizard spells. Pass.<br></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Eldritch Aid:</span><span class="c26">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c6">Another way to expend your spell slots to assist allies, but this one is a bit more situational.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Eldritch</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Heritage:</span><span class="c22">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c6">There&rsquo;s some good stuff here, and you probably have a decent Charisma. A lot of people swear by the additional capabilities this feat offers, while others seem to hate it. The Dreamspun bloodline could work really well with a Slumber Hex-happy debuffer.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c7 c8">Eschew Materials:</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c6">Always an option, but it&rsquo;s another one of those feats where the utility is determined by how often your GM goes after your gear.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Fateful Channel: </span><span class="c3 c6">This is really good for Witch Doctors, who will be able hand this out often. One thing to note is that it affects any creature healed, so you could end up giving this to enemies if you aren&rsquo;t able to exclude them with Selective Channel.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Favored Enemy Spellcasting: </span><span class="c3 c6">I mention this because in certain campaigns this could potentially be better than taking spell focus in a magical school.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Fencing Grace: </span><span class="c3 c6">Another DEX-enabling feat, and it&rsquo;s probably the feat of choice if you already have rapier proficiency from your race.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Feral Combat Training:</span><span class="c26">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c6">This has potential applications if you are a melee Shaman going the Hex Strike route.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c21 c7">Fey Foundling: </span><span class="c3 c6">If you&rsquo;re planning on healing and/or abusing Shield Other, this is a great way to keep yourself topped off. If you&rsquo;re not, you likely won&rsquo;t want this.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Flagbearer: </span><span class="c3 c6">A permanent, slightly better version of Bless with a reduced range, but it needs a free hand. This is something to consider for Shaman filling a support role like Buffer or Healer.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Furious Focus: </span><span class="c3 c6">If you&rsquo;re a melee Shaman taking Power Attack, this is a good feat to pick up, space permitting.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Glorious Heat (Sarenrae): </span><span class="c3 c6">Given that the bonus to attacks is Morale, which is pretty common, it just seems like too little for the feat cost. Plus, you need to be the one casting the fire spells and there are blind spots in the spell list, so this appears better than it is for most Shaman.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Great Fortitude: </span><span class="c3 c6">It&rsquo;s one of your weak saves, so if you can&rsquo;t think of something else to take, it&rsquo;s an option. Your Reflex save is probably worse, though - and if you&rsquo;re not in melee often, that may be more important.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c15 c26"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c7 c8">Hamatulatsu:</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c6">Supports the Hex Strike route by offering further debuff potential, but the Weapon Focus requirement is a bit steep for the feat-starved Hex Striker, and you don&rsquo;t have inexpensive options to expand your crit range.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Hurtful Strike: </span><span class="c3 c6">An option for intimidating melee Shaman, but low priority compared to a couple of the other mainstays.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c7 c8">Improved Channel: </span><span class="c3 c6">Unless it&rsquo;s an undead-heavy campaign and/or you went Grave Warden, this likely just isn&rsquo;t worth it.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c7 c8">Improved Counterspell: </span><span class="c3 c6">Not worth the cost in most cases.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Improved Critical: </span><span>Melee shaman will probably take a look at this, though it&rsquo;s really your call on whether or not you&rsquo;d prefer to spend the feat or grab the </span><span class="c20">Keen </span><span class="c3 c6">quality, if applicable.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c21 c7">Improved Familiar: </span><span class="c3 c6">There have been discussions about whether or not this is legal to take as a Shaman for various reasons but it has been clarified that Shaman DO qualify.<br></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3 c6">As for choices for your new familiar, refer to the Improved Familiar section of this guide.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c21 c7">Improved Initiative: </span><span class="c3 c6">This feat is always in the conversation, and for good reason. You&rsquo;re not likely to have a great DEX modifier and this is a solid fallback option for a feat if you can&rsquo;t think of something else to take.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Improved Unarmed Strike: </span><span class="c3 c6">I mention this mostly because it&rsquo;s a prerequisite for Hex Strike.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Intimidating Prowess: </span><span class="c3 c6">A potential addition to the intimidating melee Shaman&rsquo;s build.<br></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Iron Will: </span><span class="c3 c6">This is your good save, plus your wisdom modifier is likely to be decent, so this is probably the least-needed of the save-enhancing feats for you.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c21 c7">Leadership: </span><span class="c3 c6">As always, this is an incredibly powerful feat, but it is not PFS legal and many GMs disallow it.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Liberation Channel (Cayden Cailean): </span><span class="c3 c6">I like this, because you often need to cast Freedom of Movement on multiple party members anyways, and this lets you do it while healing.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Lightning Reflexes: </span><span class="c3 c6">Potentially your weakest save, depending on your stat array.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Lucky Healer (Halfling): </span><span class="c3 c6">Interesting option for Halfling Shaman who are specialized in healing.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Lunge:</span><span class="c3 c6">&nbsp;Given how feat-starved melee shaman tend to be, I&rsquo;m not sure this will slot into a lot of builds - but some people love it. YMMV.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Noble Scion:</span><span class="c3 c6">&nbsp;This is particularly interesting since one of the options lets you use Charisma for initiative. For many Shaman, you&rsquo;re better off taking Improved Initiative (if you take only one), but healing Shaman will likely have a Charisma high enough to make this better.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Planned Spontaneity:</span><span class="c26">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c6">You&rsquo;re probably not putting points in Knowledge (Arcana), but this is a decent option.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Power Attack: </span><span class="c3 c6">You&rsquo;re probably taking this if you&rsquo;re a melee shaman.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Protective Channel (Iomedae): </span><span class="c3 c6">I like the free spell, even if it is just a first level spell. Protection from Evil is good, you won&rsquo;t have to prepare it and/or Magic Circle Against Evil anymore, and you get to choose whether or not targets gain the benefit.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Quick Channel:</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c6">If you&rsquo;re a Life Shaman / Witch Doctor, you&rsquo;re probably getting this to improve your action economy and allow you to continue to cast support spells and/or debuff with your standard. Life Shaman can retrain after level 16, when Channeling becomes a Swift action.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">Reactive Healing:</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c6">This is an option to keep yourself from being knocked unconscious or outright killed. Feels a bit weak for the cost of a feat, though.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c21 c7">Sacred Geometry: </span><span class="c3 c6">Really good, probably not legal at your table because of how good it is, not to mention the slowdown.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c7 c8">Savior&rsquo;s Arrow: </span><span class="c3 c6">Pass.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c8 c15"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c7 c8">Seductive Channel (Calistria):</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c6">The once-per-day penalty makes this very weak for the cost of a feat.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Selective Channeling: </span><span class="c3 c6">A near-must for in-combat channelers.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><h1 class="c12" id="h.xgunm6pg1f2b"><span class="c23 c6">Shaman-like Archetypes</span></h1><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3 c6">Okay, so you like the Shaman&rsquo;s class features, but maybe you need to cover some other role, you want to add some Shaman versatility, or a full Shaman wouldn&rsquo;t make sense for your campaign. Here are all the archetypes that provide Shaman class features.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.akcjec4dzloc"><span class="c19 c7">Wizard (Spirit Whisperer)</span></h2><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c7">You get:</span><span class="c3 c6">&nbsp;Shaman Familiar (1st), Spirit Ability (1st), Greater Spirit (8th), &nbsp;Manifestation (20th), Spirit Hexes (5th, 10th, 15th), uses Intelligence instead of Wisdom for Hexes</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c7">You lose:</span><span class="c3 c6">&nbsp;Spellbook, arcane bond, arcane school, bonus feats</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3 c6">So the benefit of this archetype is that you keep the superlative Wizard spell list while gaining access to some Shaman stuff. In many ways, this is the opposite of how Wizards typically work, as they tend to focus on one or two things at all times, using their arcane bond and school to augment that focus. Instead, this lets you diversify into something else. You could be a healing wizard!</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3 c6">I like this archetype a lot, but you lose a lot of power in taking it.
