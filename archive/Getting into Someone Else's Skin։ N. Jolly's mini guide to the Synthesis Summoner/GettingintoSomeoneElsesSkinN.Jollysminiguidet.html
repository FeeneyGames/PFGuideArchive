against damage. &nbsp;But you should know how you recover it. &nbsp;By rules, the only way to do that is with the Rejuvenate Eidolon line of spells. &nbsp;Without this, you can&rsquo;t fix up your temp HP, and your Eidolon will always be coming back at its old HP/half HP. &nbsp;This does make it a required spell, but it&rsquo;s not a huge issue. &nbsp;But what is important is knowing that this is the only listed way to recover your Temp HP in case this becomes an issue. &nbsp;Make sure to either get a wand or take the spell yourself, or your symbiote will be far less useful.</span></p><p class="c1 c8 c12"><span class="c13 c9"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c9">Evolution Points and Combinations</span><span class="c3">: This is also a very easy thing to mess up, so make sure you take care to only use the points that you have. &nbsp;A lot of times, you&rsquo;ll see Eidolons coming into play with incorrect totals, which helps give the reputation of a broken class. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s your job to make sure you&rsquo;re playing a legal character, so make sure that you&rsquo;re keeping that in mind. &nbsp;Another issue is making sure that your combinations are legal. &nbsp;That has a lot to do with your natural attack limit since a lot of you will be using them (manufactured weapon users can ignore this) &nbsp;You need to make sure that you&rsquo;re following the rules for that, as well as for primary and secondary natural weapons.</span></p><p class="c1 c8 c12"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c9">Math and Calculations</span><span class="c3">: It&rsquo;s important that you do your addition and other math correctly as well, taking into account the bonuses and such that you&rsquo;ll be getting with your evolutions. &nbsp;This is especially important for changing sizes, since there are a lot of adjustments for it. &nbsp;Be careful in adjusting your size as well, since it&rsquo;s quite a large shift in power, and for most people it&rsquo;ll be too much of an increase at once. &nbsp;While it&rsquo;s homebrew, I suggest breaking it up into 2 separate evolutions so it&rsquo;s less of a steep increase all at once.</span></p><p class="c1 c8 c12"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c9">Appearance and RP</span><span class="c3">: Remember if you&rsquo;re always in your monster suit, it&rsquo;s going to be hard to get into towns. &nbsp;And if you&rsquo;re large, it&rsquo;ll be even more difficult. &nbsp;A lot of people will have issues with this, and you need a minute (unless you use a spell) to pop on the beast mode, so make sure that you&rsquo;re playing by the rules.</span></p><p class="c1 c8 c12"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c9">The rest of your party</span><span class="c3">: As was touched on earlier, make sure this character plays well with the rest of the party. &nbsp;Know that you&rsquo;re going to be one hell of a melee combatant who can start at level 1 with pounce. &nbsp;And that you&rsquo;re packing 6th level spell casting, which makes you even more dangerous. &nbsp;Be sure that you&rsquo;re playing at the same level that your party is, since it&rsquo;s not hard for you to outshine them. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re playing a team game, so find ways to help them out with your substantial buffing ability, keep your entire group functioning, and make sure to help everyone else enjoy their time at the table too.</span></p><p class="c1 c8 c12"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c21 c9"><a class="c17" href="#kix.ya1ctpfcq014">Return to Table of Content</a></span></p><a id="kix.ef4vi9s5hkj0"></a><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c7 c15">3.

relationship with your physical stats, in that you don&rsquo;t need them at all. &nbsp;Your Eidolon subsumes your physical stats, letting you dump them all to high hell. &nbsp;You can even meet prereqs for feats and such with your Eidolon. &nbsp;For this reason, all you really need is listed below.</span></p><p class="c1 c8 c12"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2">Strength </span><span class="c3">Yeah, you don&rsquo;t need this at all. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s the least valuable of the physical stats to you, so it&rsquo;s easily a 7, and possibly a 5 with the right race.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c4">Dexterity</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Just barely higher than strength, you&rsquo;ll need this for your initiative if you&rsquo;re caught without your symbiote, but even that isn&rsquo;t a huge issue.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c4">Constitution</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Another stat that&rsquo;s useful to have in case you&rsquo;re caught without your Eidolon, this one will keep you alive, which is what makes it higher than the others.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c5">Intelligence</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Considering this is a stat you keep inside of your symbiote, you want this to be good, although it doesn&rsquo;t affect a lot of what you do.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c9 c10">Wisdom</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Now this is a save boosting stat that&rsquo;s pretty helpful, and it also helps with a few skills that you&rsquo;d enjoy being better at, so it&rsquo;s worth your time to bump.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c9 c10">Charisma</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Now this is the stat you need, as it gives you more summons, spells, higher DCs, and other gifts. &nbsp;And it makes you pretty, which is just as important for your character.</span></p><p class="c1 c8 c12"><span class="c3"></span></p><a id="kix.9moip4n6i314"></a><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c28 c9 c15">Races</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c3">Your choice of race is odd since a lot of things that would matter for other characters don&rsquo;t matter for you at all, and all you really care about are your mental stats (aside from having enough Con to survive getting the sniffles when you&rsquo;re sleeping at night without it. &nbsp;Because of this, our priorities are shifting in race, although some are still quite solid while others lack that shine that they&rsquo;d normally have.</span></p><p class="c1 c8 c12"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c9">Core</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c4">Dwarf</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;While we&rsquo;re getting a penalty to charisma, both other stats that it&rsquo;s helping are good and so is the save bonus vs magic, making it at least a semi viable choice.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c5">Elf</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;The racials are &lsquo;meh&rsquo;, but the nice thing here is the weapon profs, which can give you quite a few weapons that you wouldn&rsquo;t normally get proficiency with. &nbsp;Getting longbow and long sword both are quite nice.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c5">Gnome</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Really solid racial bonuses here, nothing else is really that impressive though, so it can be a decent call.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c5">Halfing</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Another group of good racial bonuses, and the race traits aren&rsquo;t bad either, another good choice.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c9 c25">Half-Elf </span><span class="c3">The benefit here is your insane Favored Class bonus which gives you extra evolution points. &nbsp;Evolution points are your lifeblood, so getting more is of paramount importance. &nbsp;Even better with Ancestral Arms to get a weapon proficiency in case you wanted to go with manufactured weapons.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c9 c10">Half-Orc</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Wow, these are nice (and can go Blood God), with variable stat bonuses, proficiency in a few nice weapons, and a few racials that are easily traded out into better ones, half-orcs are hella solid.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c9 c10">Human</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Always good, the feat and variable stat placement help them out quite a bit, but the half-elf favored class bonus is still king, making them probably the best synths.</span></p><p class="c1 c8 c12"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c13 c9">Featured</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c9 c10">Aasimar</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Base racial adjustments are golden for these angels, and their favored class bonus is pretty nice as well, making them some fine celestial synths.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c4">Catfolk</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;The first of the dex/cha boosters (not bad for you at all), aside from okay racial adjustments, there&rsquo;s not really much here worth checking out, probably on the lower end of the dex/cha group.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c4">Dhampir</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Another dex/cha, there&rsquo;s again no real reason to pick it aside from flavor, so it goes back in the pile.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c5">Drow</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Oh look, dex/cha. &nbsp;They do get some nice racial abilities though and some decent weapons as well as nice darkvision. &nbsp;So far these are looking like decent enough synths.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c5">Fetchling</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Another dex/cha, but we have a bunch of random SLAs thrown on, making this at least passable.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c4">Goblin</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Finally, a non dex/cha. &nbsp;Goblins do have a discount version of the half elf favored class bonus, but it all has to related to fire, and without as flexible a stat adjustment, this fall short.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2">Hobgoblin</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Now this doesn&rsquo;t really give anything we want, the best thing it has going as that it has no cha penalty. &nbsp;They can sneak well and have darkvision, but meh?</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c5">Ifrit</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;ANOTHER dex/cha race, but these firestarters aren&rsquo;t bad thanks to the alternative racial trait they can get to get +4 to initiative. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s a few others, but this race could easily be worse.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2">Kobold</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;No good stats, no good racial traits, no reason to be here.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2">Orc</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Ew...just ew...racials here are garbage, adjustments are garbage, find you a human to love and come back.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2">Oread</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;All wrong stat adjustments and no redeeming racial traits make this trash.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c4">Ratfolk</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Unless you&rsquo;re shooting for skills, rats aren&rsquo;t anything spectacular, but they do get nice skill bonuses.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2">Slyph</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Bad racial adjustments all over here, and no good racial traits, so most elemental people aren&rsquo;t great.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c4">Tengu</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Not great racial adjustments, but being able to get some nice weapons out of this makes them passable.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c5">Tiefling</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Div, Kyton, or Raksasha-spawn are what you&rsquo;re looking for here, but tieflings have enough neat alternative racials where you&rsquo;re certain to find something that you enjoy.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2">Undine</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Water people ain&rsquo;t great, just a fact of nature. &nbsp;Get youself a fire people, them good people.</span></p><p class="c1 c8 c12"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c9">Uncommon</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c9">Note</span><span class="c3">: Make sure you get GM permission on this, since these races may not be suitable for your game.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c9 c10">Changeling</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;I really like these ladies, aside from the con loss. &nbsp;They get good racial adjustments, and can get free bonus melee damage, and can take a feat for even more damage. &nbsp;Hagspawn are solid synths.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c9 c10">Gillmen</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Again, not a fan of the wisdom loss, but aside from that there&rsquo;s some solid racials here and a bonus to mind affecting effects that help offset this, and they can breathe underwater which can be helpful.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c9 c10">Kitsune</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Looks like even foxes can be good synths with great racial adjustments and the shape change ability is really nice utility, which is quite useful.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c5">Merfolk</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Who knew Ariel could fight? &nbsp;With the low land speed negated by your synth form (or just go strong tail), you&rsquo;re decent enough to actually work well in a class like this.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c5">Nagaji</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Cha bonus is nice, str bonus isn&rsquo;t, but an int penalty isn&rsquo;t terrible, and bonus vs enchant is okay, not bad.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c9 c10">Samsaran</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;I want to like these blue bastards more, but their best and most unique ability, Mystic Past Life, really works better with anyone stealing from their list. &nbsp;They can steal some nice stuff from bards though, so they&rsquo;re still a strong choice, but they don&rsquo;t get the bonuses you really want them to for their reputation.</span></p><p class="c1 c8 c12"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c8 c12"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c8 c12"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1

class="c3">Most of the traits you&rsquo;re taking are going to be combat based traits, since you&rsquo;re a machine of murder and vengeance. &nbsp;You don&rsquo;t even really need to work on your magic much since it&rsquo;s mostly going to be for self buffing, meaning you don&rsquo;t really have to care about anything but damage dealing.</span></p><p class="c1 c8 c12"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Combat Traits</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c10">Axe to Grind</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">This is a damage bonus that&rsquo;s going to apply pretty often, especially once you start getting larger, being the main combatant in the fray.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2">Bloodthirsty</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">While sounding quite cool, &nbsp;there&rsquo;s not here to validate a trait slot.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Careful Combatant</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c14 c11">This can be quite useful if you HAVE to withdraw since a lot of the things you can fight have some very nice reach, and keeping yourself safe is pretty nice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Killer</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c14 c11">Another cool name for another crappy trait, avoid this if you can.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c10">Reactionary</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c11 c14">Any +2 to initiative is considered here, as all of them are great and amazing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c10">Threatening</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Defender</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c11">If you&rsquo;re going the Stalwart route, this is a +1 to all attacks. &nbsp;If not, this is basically worthless, since actually using Combat Expertise is such a bad move.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c10">Vengeful</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c14 c11">Another damage boost, this one is also pretty easy to activate, but does require you to take damage, so it&rsquo;s a little worse than Axe to Grind.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c0 c14"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c14">Faith Traits</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Fate&rsquo;s Favored</span><span class="c9 c35">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">This is really only helpful for a Half-Orc to boost their racial luck bonus to saves.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Unnatural Presence</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c14 c11">Giving your intimidate a bit more utility is good if you&rsquo;re scary.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c0 c14"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c14">Magic Traits</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Desperate Speed</span><span class="c6 c14 c11">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a +5 to the fly speed of your eidolon suit, so it&rsquo;s okay, but won&rsquo;t matter until 5th level.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Hedge Magician</span><span class="c6 c14 c11">&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re a penny pincher, this will help stretch your crafting budget.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Kin Bond</span><span class="c6 c14 c11">&nbsp;A save reroll is pretty nice, and nothing says you can&rsquo;t bond with your eidolon, although it can&rsquo;t be a twin sadly, so you could pick one of the other characters, maybe a paladin?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Unscathed</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c14 c11">Mostly for Tieflings, Suli, and Aasimars, getting a little extra protection is never a bad thing, especially if its from a few different elements.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c0 c14"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c14">Social Traits</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c10">Adopted</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c14 c11">This trait&rsquo;s as good as the trait you take with it so it&rsquo;s hard to rate this one on its own.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Rich Parents </span><span class="c6 c14 c11">While starting with extra money is nice, money is fleeting while a trait is forever. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d consider most traits worth more than 900 gold in my experience.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c6 c14 c11"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c14">Equipment Traits</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Heirloom Weapon</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c14 c11">While much maligned for its errata, this errata could actually help you. &nbsp;The bonus of a +1 to AOOs is nice, but the real bonus here is the +2 to CMB rolls to Sunder/Trip is actually pretty damn nice. &nbsp;While it&rsquo;s not the marvel it used to be, combine it with Sword Scion to basically get the same effect. &nbsp;Be sure to have the Masterwork Transformation spell around or on a scroll to keep this weapon viable.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c0 c14"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Campaign Traits </span><span class="c6 c11">(</span><span class="c0">Note: </span><span class="c6 c14 c11">These traits are generally intended for a specific campaign, and may not be suitable for everyday play. &nbsp;Consult with your GM before taking these traits)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c25">Finding Haleen</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c14 c11">The BEST trait in the game, &nbsp;a +1 to &nbsp;HP and Skill Points per level is too powerful for a trait. &nbsp;This is a 3.5 trait, and not really suited to a current game, but if your GM lets you take it, then take it and thank your god for the chance to do it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c10">Sword Scion</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c14 c11">Getting a masterwork weapon and a +1 on attack rolls with a very solid weapon is a great use of a trait, something that you can really use well if you&rsquo;re proficient with it.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c0 c14"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c14">Race Traits</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Bred for War (Human)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c11">The CMB bonus is what you&rsquo;re here for, and make you a bit more scary as an added bonus. &nbsp;Not a great trait, but it does help out CMB monsters.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c10">Boar Resilience (Werebear)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c11">Foregoing the sucky feat of Endurance is too good, but </span><span class="c2">lower</span><span class="c6 c14 c11">&nbsp;if it&rsquo;s not considered to count for a prereq when selecting Stalwart.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Enlightened Warrior (Aasimar)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c14 c11">Barbarian and Monk have a lot of synergy, so being able to multiclass between the two can prove quite useful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c10">Feline Instinct (Weretiger) </span><span class="c3">While slightly situational, you have good enough instincts to keep you aware of what&rsquo;s going on, and it&rsquo;s the biggest bonus to initiative you can get.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c10">Glory of Old (Dwarf)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c14 c11">I love this, it continues to pump your awesome dwarven saves, and stacks with Steel Soul to make a Synthesist who&rsquo;s hard to keep down.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Precision Hearing (Werebat)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c14 c11">Adding utility for one of your best skills is a solid use of a trait.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Shadow Stabber (Tiefling)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c14 c11">While it&rsquo;s not incredibly easy for you to be unseen, a +2 on all strikes while you are is a definitive buff to your damage, enough so to seek out invisibility.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c10">Suicidal (Tiefling)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c14 c11">I&rsquo;m a big fan of this, as this lets you keep in front of your more vulnerable party members when it counts, which is pretty amazing for a trait, even if once a day.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c10">Superior Clutch (Tiefling)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c14 c11">Considering you can go large and huge, imagine the damage you could do with a gargantuan weapon with damage dice scaling.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c10">Tiger&rsquo;s Claws (Weretiger)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c14 c11">I forget, what kind of action do you love using to attack again?</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c6 c14 c11"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c14">Regional Traits</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Chosen Child</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c14 c11">Almost as bad as Rich Parents, this at least gets you +900 gold instead of changing your starting gold, so if you&rsquo;re going to sell a trait do it for this one.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">River Rat</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c11">A bonus to damage yet again, but only with daggers. &nbsp;But there&rsquo;s a swimming bonus in here, and it&rsquo;s kinda flavorful, so it&rsquo;s not terrible.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c9">Religion Traits</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c5">Blade of Mercy</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Mostly for your bounty hunter types, being able to switch between lethal and nonlethal is a nice trick, and the bonus damage is pretty nice as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c25">Defensive Strategist</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Always golden, always being ready for combat is the best situation to be in.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Magic is Life</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;While it&rsquo;s not amazing, auto stabilizing is pretty damn nice since you&rsquo;ll always be magic&rsquo;d up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c25">Second Chance</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">A reroll on any save once a day? &nbsp;This is beyond good, you NEED it. &nbsp;Kind of hard to find a better bang for your religious buck than saving your life.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Veteran of Battle</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">This might just be a personal preference, but the +1 to initiative is nice if you didn&rsquo;t take something else to boost it. &nbsp;But the quick draw in response to battle is what I really like about this trait.</span></p><p class="c1 c8 c12"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c21 c9"><a class="c17"

Door as an SLA is pretty nice.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2">Aspect</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Since you ARE your eidolon, this doesn&rsquo;t really help at all. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t steal evo points from it, please.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c5">Greater Shielded Meld</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Same as before, but better! &nbsp;Never something worth turning down.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2">Split Forms</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;If you wanted to do this, you could have just taken the vanilla summoner.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c4">Greater Aspect</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;I like this for one reason, and that&rsquo;s being able to get fast healing so you can keep giving your eidolon hit points and keep it around. &nbsp;Aside from that, don&rsquo;t steal points.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c9">Twin Eidolon</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Yeah, this doesn&rsquo;t work. &nbsp;Or at least there&rsquo;s no real explanation for it. &nbsp;Does it make a copy of your Eidolon like in Split Form? &nbsp;Does it let you give someone else a monster suit? &nbsp;It&rsquo;s not super clear.</span></p><p class="c1

&nbsp;There&rsquo;s only one acceptable multiclass for the synth, and that&rsquo;s Paladin 2. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s it, everything else will make you worse at what you do. &nbsp;You NEED to keep evolving and getting stronger, and doing anything other than taking synth levels is going to stop that. &nbsp;So why paladin 2? &nbsp;Because you get Divine Grace, so you&rsquo;ll get your charisma bonus to all saves. &nbsp;Is this worth it to you? &nbsp;It could be, I don&rsquo;t know you, it&rsquo;s not worth it to me because I don&rsquo;t like being 2 levels behind the curve in both spells and evolutions, but you could be terrified of failing saves, and if so, it&rsquo;s a fine multiclass.</span></p><p class="c1 c8 c12"><span class="c3"></span></p><a id="id.587ngs9hxo54"></a><p class="c1

evo points, but for not nearly long enough to matter, making this really meh. &nbsp;Taking this archetype is basically going to remove Summon Monster from your arsenal, and that&rsquo;s not a great

Feast...not great.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c9">7th </span><span class="c2">Avatar Gambit</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Yeah, you don&rsquo;t want to dismiss your eidolon. &nbsp;This is trash.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c9">11th </span><span class="c2">Rage Power</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;I really like rage powers, but this was a long road to get to a bad place.</span></p><p class="c1 c8 c12"><span class="c3"></span></p><a id="kix.j98s8nmnaxo8"></a><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c28 c9 c15">Skills</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c4">Craft</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">While this is kind of neat, you&rsquo;re not really doing anything special with it, which makes it kind of a waste unless you need something to do with your skill points.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c5">Fly </span><span class="c3">You&rsquo;ll be flying eventually, so you&rsquo;ll want to be good at it, and this will help you do that.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c4">Handle Animal</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Kind of a weird skill here...not really sure why you have it...okay?</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c9 c10">Knowledge: All</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Now these are a lot more useful, especially Religion/Planes/Arcana, which should do a lot to help you out to summon new and cool things.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c5">Linguistics</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">It&rsquo;s not really a great skill, but it&rsquo;s worth it to pick up a few languages to make sure you can talk to the strange creatures that you&rsquo;re summoning up.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2">Profession</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Yeah, this is worthless. &nbsp;You get the same result with craft, and the chance to actually make something instead of just running a business.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2">Ride</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">You&rsquo;re never going to ride anything, you&rsquo;re almost certainly whatever you&rsquo;d want to be riding, so skip out on this.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c9 c10">Spellcraft</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">You need this for knowing anything about magic, which makes it important to you.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c9 c25">Use Magic Device </span><span class="c3">The best skill in the game, and you&#39;re charisma based. &nbsp;Take it, love it.</span></p><p class="c1 c8 c12"><span class="c13 c9"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c13 c9">Non Class Skills</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c9

shop?</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c9 c10">Perception</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">It&rsquo;s not a class skill, but it&rsquo;s very important that you see, and you&rsquo;re able to be made much better at seeing through evolution, so keep this maxed.</span></p><p class="c1 c8 c12"><span class="c13 c9"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c21 c9"><a

c24">&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;d call it a partnership if I had to call it anything. &nbsp;I needed help, and it was there. &nbsp;It needed a body, and I was there. &nbsp;Overall, I&rsquo;d say we&rsquo;re pretty happy. &nbsp;Sure, sometimes it can get a little demanding, but that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s like in every relationship, right?&rdquo; &nbsp;Lark Northin, cultist of the Blood God</span></p><p class="c1 c8 c12"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c3">Feats are strange for you because of how you qualify for them. &nbsp;Now you may be saying &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have the strength to pick up Power Attack!&rdquo;, and normally you&rsquo;d be right. &nbsp;But the rule is that if you meet the prereqs for a feat for 24 hours (so pull an all nighter with your symbiote), you can qualify for a feat. &nbsp;Sure, you won&rsquo;t be able to use it when you&rsquo;re outside in your own skin, but that doesn&rsquo;t really matter when the only time you should be out of it is when you&rsquo;re sleeping.</span></p><p class="c1 c8 c12"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c3">For the most part, you&rsquo;re a combat specialist at first, and your feats should reflect that. &nbsp;Your spellcasting, while powerful, can easily stand alone without feat support, meaning you&rsquo;re free to explore combat feats and really help develop your own style. &nbsp;Really your only big decision here is if you&rsquo;re thinking of going with a weapon wielder or natural attacks.</span></p><p class="c1 c8 c12"><span

class="c2">Skill Boosting Feats</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;(</span><span class="c2">Skill Focus and others</span><span class="c3">) No. &nbsp;You don&rsquo;t need your skills boosted, and if you did, you&rsquo;d take an evo to give them a +8 bonus, not a feat to give them a +2/+3 bonus. &nbsp;Your feats are worth more to you than skill bonuses, and it would be a shame to lose out on being awesome simply because you wanted to pick locks better or whatever other dumb crap you liked to do. &nbsp;These are prerequisite feats only.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2">Agile Maneuvers</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;This isn&rsquo;t for you, since you should be just getting bigger and slower.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c9 c10">Arcane Strike</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;This actually isn&rsquo;t a terrible use of your swift action, and with 3+ natural attacks, this damage can really start to add up, giving a lot more power to your swings.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c9 c10">Augment Summoning</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;You like this. &nbsp;You like this a lot. &nbsp;At worst, you only use it for summoning your eidolon through spells and getting a buff because of it. &nbsp;Free stat boost for summons are GREAT.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c4">Blind-Fight</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;You can get a lot of alternative senses, so unless this is a prereq for something you want, pass.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c4">Combat Casting</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;I&rsquo;d buff before combat, but the bigger you are, the more you&rsquo;ll provoke. &nbsp;Decent early, but the later you go, the less useful it is. &nbsp;Consider it for a retraining option.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c4">Combat Expertise</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Another &lsquo;prereq&rsquo; feat, you don&rsquo;t want to take penalties to hit for AC.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2">Improved, Greater Disarm</span><span class="c6 c26">/</span><span class="c2">Feign</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;These combat maneuvers aren&rsquo;t great for you, stick with raw power.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c5">Improved, Greater Trip</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Tripping is actually quite nice, and for those natural attackers who get 3+ attacks, using 1 of them to get a +4 on attack rolls is good. &nbsp;Even better since as you get larger, you can keep tripping larger creatures, making this strategy viable longer than most others.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c9 c10">Combat Reflexes</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Out of anyone, you can make something good with this as long as you keep your dex up. &nbsp;So if you&rsquo;re gonna go big, make sure everything that steps into your reach pays for it.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c9 c10">Craft Wondrous Item</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;Yeah, this makes you able to make your own gear, it&rsquo;s pretty awesome.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c5">Critical Focus</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;This is mostly for weapon wielders, since natural attacks aren&rsquo;t the best crit fishers. &nbsp;They could try for it, but there&rsquo;s too many attacks they&rsquo;d need to focus on, so this is weapons exclusive.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2">Bleeding</span><span class="c6">/</span><span class="c4">Sickening</span><span class="c6">/</span><span class="c9 c10">Staggering</span><span class="c6">/</span><span class="c5">Blinding Critical</span><span class="c6 c23">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Blinding requires retraining, but if you&rsquo;re going to crit focus and you don&rsquo;t mind waiting for BAB +13, I&rsquo;d hold out for staggering since it&rsquo;s so debilitating.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c4">Archery Feats</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;You&rsquo;re not a ranged character, and if you are, you&rsquo;ve picked a strange way to do it. &nbsp;Solid for ranged as expected, but since I don&rsquo;t think you can dual wield bows without an archetype, this isn&rsquo;t great.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c4">Defensive Combat Training</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;You should already have a killer CMD, but it could always be higher.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2">Dodge</span><span class="c6 c26">/</span><span class="c2">Mobility</span><span class="c6 c26">/</span><span class="c2">Spring Attack</span><span class="c6 c26">/</span><span class="c2">Wind Stance</span><span class="c6 c26">/</span><span class="c2">Lightning Stance</span><span class="c6 c26">/</span><span class="c2">Whirlwind Attack</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Everything from this line is terrible, and it&rsquo;s depressing that it is. &nbsp;Dodge is a chain you don&rsquo;t want to head down.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c4">Endurance</span><span class="c6">/</span><span class="c4">Diehard</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;Endurance is just a prereq feat on its own, but diehard isn&rsquo;t bad if you&rsquo;re going for a vital strike build, since your actions are limited. &nbsp;Without that though, it&rsquo;s not super great.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c5">Eschew Materials</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;I think you kind of need this for a lot of your casting since I&rsquo;m not sure if you can get to your spell component pouch while monster&rsquo;d up unless you keep it outside and attach it afterwards. &nbsp;This feat is really dependent on how your GM rules these sorts of things.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c5">Exotic Weapon Proficiency</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re going to wield a weapon, make it exotic. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s no reason to spend evo points on getting prof with all martial weapons when you can burn a feat to get one great weapon.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c4">Save Boosting Feats</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Aside from reflex you have good enough saves with the con bonuses from getting large.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c9 c10">Improved Critical</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Again, really only the best for weapon wielders, but it&rsquo;s really nice for them, since your crits are going to level mountains and shake the bones of the old gods of this world.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c5">Improved Initiative</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;For pouncers, this is heaven since it gives you a better chance to go first and get pounce off ASAP. &nbsp;For non pouncers, it can be skipped while you wait for people to wade into your melee range.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c5">Improved Unarmed Strike</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Normally I wouldn&rsquo;t be big on this, but it does open up a few cool options. &nbsp;First of all, with Feral Combat Training, you can make one of your natural attacks with this. &nbsp;This opens up taking Pummeling Charge with it (which is hard to validate without a MoMS dip), but it&rsquo;s an alternative route to pounce.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c4">Deflect</span><span class="c6 c20">/</span><span class="c4">Snatch Arrows</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Just take the arrow, don&rsquo;t be a coward.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c4">Improved</span><span class="c6 c20">/</span><span class="c4">Greater Grapple</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;With your strength and size bonuses, you&rsquo;re not a terrible grappler, even with your moderate BAB. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s not super important, but you could try to build around it if you wanted.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c5">Intimidating Prowess</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;This + Evo = one scary monster. &nbsp;If you want to build around fear, this will help greatly.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c9">Leadership</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;If you can take it, do. &nbsp;If not, don&rsquo;t. &nbsp;Even better with your charisma focus, but it was already hype.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c9 c10">Lunge</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;More reach is always good, you can never reach far enough.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2">Mounted Feats</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;You&rsquo;re the one who should be mounted, not the other way around.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c9 c25">Power Attack</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Yeah, you&rsquo;re getting this 3rd level. &nbsp;The amount it will increase your damage is just terrifying, and if you&rsquo;re smart about your natural attacks, it&rsquo;s a 2/1 exchange for them all. &nbsp;You basically need this to help abuse your monstrous strength stat, since accuracy shouldn&rsquo;t be a huge issue for you. &nbsp;Get this, love it, destroy.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c4">Cleave, Greater</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Maybe for a weapon build, but you should be pouncing somehow, so meh.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c4">Improved, Greater Bull Rush</span><span class="c6 c20">/</span><span class="c4">Overrun</span><span class="c6 c20">/</span><span class="c4">Sunder</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;None of these are great, stick to tripping.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c5">Spell Focus</span><span class="c6 c23">&nbsp;(</span><span class="c5">Conjuration</span><span class="c6 c23">)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;You&rsquo;ll need this for Augment Summon, and it&rsquo;s not bad even without that.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2">Spell Penetration, Greater</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Most spells you cast will be on willing targets, so this is a waste.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c4">Step Up</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;This isn&rsquo;t as good for you since you&rsquo;ll be large and your opponents hopefully won&rsquo;t be adjacent to you.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c4">Toughness</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;I&rsquo;m not a big fan, but some people love extra HP, so this isn&rsquo;t a terrible way to get it.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c4">Two Weapon Fighting Feats</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Really, you&rsquo;re better off going multiweapon fighting if you&rsquo;re not going to focus on huge weapons, although annoyingly there&rsquo;s some good feats that require TWF, so it&rsquo;s basically a prereq feat.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c5">Vital Strike, Improved</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;I really want to like this more, and since you could possibly go Gargantuan you could have one hell of a single hit, but only going up to improved is a hard roadblock. &nbsp;You could make this viable by piling on effects to a bite attack, it&rsquo;s at least an option that&rsquo;s worth considering for fun.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c4">Weapon Focus</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Another weapon only feat, I just don&rsquo;t like this, but it&rsquo;s a prereq none the less for other stuff.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c4">Dazzling Display</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;You can make yourself quite scary with the right combo of feats, so if you want to really put the fear of god into someone, it&rsquo;s not hard with this feat.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2">Shatter Defenses</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Seeing as you don&rsquo;t really get much from attacking flat footed opponents, you can skip this.</span></p><a id="id.gnx2crprjits"></a><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c13 c9">Advanced Player&rsquo;s Guide</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c5">Additional Traits</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Traits are great, although you need to make sure you&rsquo;re not doubling up on categories.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2">Arcane Blast</span><span class="c6 c26">/</span><span class="c2">Shield</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;You have far better things to do with your spells than thnk.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2">Bloody Assault</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;While it seems cool, this is garbage, not worth your time.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2">Bodyguard</span><span class="c6">/</span><span class="c4">In Harm&rsquo;s Way</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Just adding +2 to someone&rsquo;s AC isn&rsquo;t really worth an immediate action, especially if you have to be adjacent. &nbsp;Tanking a hit is much better, but even that isn&rsquo;t super reliable.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2">Combat Patrol</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Needing Mobility kills this for me, as it wasn&rsquo;t even super great to start off with.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c4">Dazing Assault</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;If there were any way to boost the DC, this could be better, but the saves you&rsquo;re forcing with it aren&rsquo;t going to relevant when you can pick this feat up due to your 3/4ths BAB.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2">Eldritch Claws</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;This has the same effect as a +2 amulet of mighty fist...which you&rsquo;ll no doubt own. &nbsp;Not great.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c4">Furious Focus</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;A slightly scaling Weapon Focus for V. Strike builds, it could be worse, but it&rsquo;s not great.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c5">Heroic Defiance</span><span class="c6">/</span><span class="c2">Recovery</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Defiance can stall a debilitating condition, but the prereqs are steep. &nbsp;Recovery on the other hand is garbage, and should really be avoided at all cost.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c5">Improved, Greater Dirty Trick</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;I really like dirty tricks, but until you can get quick dirty trick, this is taking up your only attack, which isn&rsquo;t great. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a lot of feats, but it does open up some decent debuff options.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2">Rending Claws</span><span class="c3">&nbsp; Two Weapon Rend, this ain&rsquo;t. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a conditional extra 1d6 damage, that&rsquo;s terrible.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c9 c10">Spell Perfection</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;While you&rsquo;re not too big on metamagic, getting one spell to be amazing is worth taking a metamagic feat, it just depends on which one you want to be your signature spell.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c5">Steel Soul</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Making dwarves more hardy is the good thing for feats to do.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c4">Summoner&rsquo;s Call</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;The duration of this buff isn&rsquo;t great and neither is the type of bonus, so it&rsquo;s the kind of thing you should retrain if you take it early, it has little value later in the game.</span></p><p class="c1 c8 c12"><span class="c13 c9"></span></p><a id="id.566jlos0zd7i"></a><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c13 c9">Ultimate Magic</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2">Antagonize</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Yeah, now with how it&rsquo;s been errata&rsquo;d, it&rsquo;s not worth the action.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c5">Eldritch Heritage</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;This isn&rsquo;t bad for you at all, seeing as you have the charisma to take it and your best race, half-elf, gets a free skill focus. &nbsp;A familiar could be fun, as with other options, but make sure the ones you&rsquo;re getting don&rsquo;t affect you personally, since you&rsquo;ll lose those when you super suit up.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c9 c25">Extra Evolution</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Now this is always golden, and you should always take it. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m pretty sure it&rsquo;s ruled to work with Synth even though you don&rsquo;t &lsquo;technically&rsquo; have the eidolon class feature. &nbsp;But evolution points are your lifeblood, and getting more will only help make you into a more powerful engine of destruction.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c4">Extra Summons</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Not a very strong feat choice, since you&rsquo;re not the best at using this feature yourself.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c5">Resilient Eidolon</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;Again, it&rsquo;s grey if you can use this, but this feat is mainly protection for if you&rsquo;re targeted with an effect that would knock you out like </span><span class="c6 c24">Sleep</span><span class="c3">, making sure you don&rsquo;t turn back into Bruce Banner too soon.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c9 c10">Superior Summoning</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re deciding to use your SM ability, using this to help flood the field with additional creatures can help turn the tide of battle. &nbsp;Just try not to take too long with your turn, okay?</span></p><p class="c1 c8 c12"><span class="c13 c9"></span></p><a id="id.m6uu6b87fpr0"></a><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c13 c9">Ultimate Combat</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c4">Body Shield</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re going to grapple, cover is nice to have, although it&rsquo;s not my thing.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c5">Chokehold</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;Choking someone else out can be a viable strategy, although I think this depends on if it&rsquo;s ruled if they can hold their breath in response to you doing this. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d say not, you don&rsquo;t announce you&rsquo;re about to choke them, so it&rsquo;s a decent way to bring in someone alive and stop someone from </span><span class="c6 c24">Dimension Door</span><span class="c3">ing to safety.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c5">Cleaving Finish, Improved</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Your reach should be impressive enough to use this well, but it&rsquo;s really only useful for minion slaying. &nbsp;Still, it&rsquo;s great for that purpose, and worth considering.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2">Death or Glory</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;No. &nbsp;Just no. &nbsp;Everything this lets you do is bad. &nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c5">Deathless Initiate,</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Master, Zealot</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Initiate is actually nice due to still being able to pounce and full attack, although the other feats in this chain are really just filler. &nbsp;Sucks you need to be a half orc though.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c5">Devastating Strike</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;For those of you going down the Vital Strike chain, this is probably an important stop to you, since you need to do everything you can to make that one attack as big as possible.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c4">Dimensional Agility</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;By itself, this is pretty tame, but you already knew that, and it leads to good places.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c9 c10">Dimensional Assault</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;Now this is why you came, giving you even more ways to telepounce. &nbsp;Not only does it look super sweet, but it also stops terrain from being an issue on your charge, meaning you&rsquo;re always functioning at full potential. &nbsp;And since you get </span><span class="c6 c24">Dimension Door</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;as a 3rd level spell, you can get this as early as 9th level (7th with retraining), meaning you can start telepouncing very early. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s dangerous to overuse though since you could very easily burn through all of your 3rd level spells, so take care to only use this when needed.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c5">Dimensional Dervish</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Now this isn&rsquo;t much of an upgrade since you already have pounce, but for those of you without pounce, here it is. &nbsp;That basically makes it a biped exclusive feat, but if you don&rsquo;t have it any other way, here&rsquo;s pounce for the cost of another feat.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c4">Dimensional Maneuvers</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;A slow end to a good feat chain, a +4 on trip is nice, but not worth this feat, since you hopefully won&rsquo;t be needing to use it too much, making this bonus apply less than you&rsquo;d hope.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c4">Feral Combat Training</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;While your natural attacks are going to be doing more damage than your unarmed ones, unless you dipped MoMS, your natural attacks are always better, and the feat investment isn&rsquo;t great.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c5">Final Embrace, Horror, Master</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;These feats require you to choose serpentine for your base form, and that&rsquo;s not great, but some of us don&rsquo;t like being hurt monsters, we just want to grapple. &nbsp;And this lets you constrict things of your size, which as you level should grow smaller and smaller. &nbsp;Making an opponent shaken as well is another help, but Master is actually really nice when you&rsquo;re huge, since your base damage for your attacks is harsh.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c9 c10">Hammer the Gap</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;This can really help increase that damage and accuracy if you&rsquo;re a multi armed/weaponed monster, making sure that every attack of yours lands and causing even more damage than before.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2">Moonlight Stalker, Feign, Master</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Syths don&rsquo;t have a great way of generating low light conditions, so while if you can get into that condition it&rsquo;s nice, it&rsquo;s not something you can rely on, and the prereqs don&rsquo;t make this worth it either. &nbsp;Both additional feats are just as bad, stick with Hammer the Gap and Arcane Strike.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c5">Quick Dirty Trick</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;This is what makes tricking worth it, but it&rsquo;s a large investment, so it&rsquo;s up to you to decide if it&rsquo;s worth it. &nbsp;Blinding an opponent can increase your accuracy to intense amounts though.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c4">Rending Fury,</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Improved, Greater</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Most of you will have 4+ claw attacks eventually since they&rsquo;re just so good, so it&rsquo;s not super important to cut down on the number of claws you need to hit. &nbsp;Improved gives garbage bonus damage though, and 1d6 bleed damage for Master is just insulting.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c4">Stalwart,</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5">Improved</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;The worst thing about these feats is how many feats you need to get them up and running. &nbsp;Considering you need Endurance, Diehard, and Combat Expertise to use these at their best (along with probably also taking Power Attack penalties on attack), Stalwart can be hard to fit onto builds, even if the DR is really nice. &nbsp;Plus Improved, while great, comes online very late. &nbsp;They&rsquo;re good, but very intensive.</span></p><p class="c1 c8 c12"><span class="c13

class="c3">&nbsp;Now this can be nice, seeing as anything you summon with 4 legs could be picking up pounce, and therefore always putting maximum hurt onto opponents.</span></p><p class="c1 c8 c12"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c8 c12"><span class="c13 c9"></span></p><a id="id.gegoem3pkvhq"></a><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c13 c9">Misc Feats</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c5">Ability Focus</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;There&rsquo;s a lot of abilities you get that have saves that can be made better by this.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c9 c10">Cornugon Smash</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;This is the best way to intimidate, hands down. &nbsp;And it works well with Hurtful too.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c5">Ferocious Summons</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Keeping your summon buddies around is very helpful, especially if you&rsquo;re having them around for a minute a level. &nbsp;Only for half orcs though.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Horn of the Criosphinx</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Weapon Wielders only, if you&rsquo;re pouncing with a 2 hander (not a bad idea), this is going to increase your damage quite a bit, abusing that intense strength bonus of yours.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c9 c10">Hurtful</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;The best use of this feat is with the above feat, although if you&rsquo;re using this, you&rsquo;re not using Arcane Strike. &nbsp;If you have an attack that has a lot of nice things attached to it (trip, poison, etc) or aren&rsquo;t throwing out 6+ attacks a round, this is probably better than Arcane Strike.</span></p><p class="c1 c8 c12"><span class="c13 c9"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c21 c9"><a class="c17"
