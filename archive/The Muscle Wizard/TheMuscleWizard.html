class="c9 c7">Introduction</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most wizards are pansies. &nbsp;They hide in the back of the fight casting spells to help the rest of the party who do the real fighting. &nbsp;For those out there who are smart enough to master the arcane arts, brave enough to charge into combat headfirst, and strong enough to go head to head with an orc barbarian, there is another way. &nbsp;The honorable path of muscle wizardry. &nbsp;Using all your arcane talents to buff yourself up to barbarian like strength and then kill your enemies the way god intended, with heaps of muscle and steel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although muscle wizards are the &ldquo;strongest&rdquo; type of wizard, they aren&rsquo;t exactly the optimal use of the class. &nbsp;However they are a ton of fun (nothing like watching your friends faces when you say you&#39;re rolling a wizard and then show up with a greatsword) and if built right can consistently be a benefit to the party in combat as well as out of it. &nbsp;Like most melee characters muscle wizards really shine early on in the game and slowly get eclipsed by magic. &nbsp;Luckily as a wizard you&rsquo;re good at that too so you can shift gears at later levels if you want. &nbsp;Muscle wizards can go on to become excellent buff wizards, undead lord style necromancers, summoners, and more. &nbsp;You can even use some of you tremendous strength to cast expensive spells with blood money to save yourself a lot of gold. &nbsp;The only real problem with switching to a normal caster halfway through is your intelligence probably won&#39;t be as high as a normal wizard, so your spells DCs will be a bit lower. &nbsp;If you plan on becoming a more traditional wizard later on think about how to budget your feats and attributes early on. &nbsp;This guide however assumes that you are fully committed to being the biggest, strongest, most badass person in the room.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Muscle wizards face a multitude of challenges including, but not limited to: Low HP, Low AC, Low BAB, and Lack of proficiency with martial weapons. &nbsp;Luckily muscle wizards love a good challenge, and have a few resources other warriors may not. &nbsp;These resources must be carefully spent to fix the problems you have. &nbsp;It should also be noted that abyssal sorcerers make great melee casters, and Brown fur Transmuters were pretty much built to be muscle casters. &nbsp;Although not true muscle &ldquo;wizards&rdquo; most of this still applies to them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c7">A Guide to the Guide</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c21"><span class="c3">Like most guides we&rsquo;ll talk about stats, races, class abilities, feats, and spells. &nbsp;Each option will be graded and assigned a color based on how well they fit with the muscle wizard&rsquo;s way of life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Blue</span><span>: The best options. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m not going to say you </span><span class="c15">have</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">to take them, but you should</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Green</span><span class="c3">: A great option. &nbsp;Maybe not top choice, but worth considering</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Orange</span><span class="c3">: Not a great option, but there are a few situations where it might be ok</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Red</span><span class="c3">: A bad idea. &nbsp;Maybe it&rsquo;s useless, maybe it actively makes you worse, either way I&rsquo;d avoid it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c16">Ability Scores</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- Like most classes your ability score are really going to determine what you can do. &nbsp;You have to balance saves, HP, AC, casting, and attacks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Strength</span><span class="c3">: You&rsquo;r most important ability score, even more than Int. &nbsp;When your hitting things this what counts</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Dexterity</span><span class="c3">: AC and Reflex saves. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s good to have, but most of your defences aren&rsquo;t going to come from AC so don&rsquo;t worry too much about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Constitution</span><span class="c3">: Probably your third most important ability score after Str and Int. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll need all the HP you can get, and Fort saves are good too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Intelligence</span><span class="c3">: You are a wizard after all. &nbsp;Since most of your spells are buffs you don&rsquo;t need to worry about saves, but you do need to be able to cast all your spell levels. &nbsp;I would recommend at least a 14.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Wisdom</span><span class="c3">: You already have good will saves, so you can get away with dropping this a little. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Charisma</span><span class="c3">: You really don&rsquo;t need it for anything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">At 15 point buy I&rsquo;d say something like STR 16, DEX 12, CON 12, INT 14, WIS 10, CHA 7</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c16">Races</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- Your race can up some relevant stats a bit and give you access to some traits that will really help you smooth the build along. &nbsp;Generally want bonuses to the relevant stats and some sort of weapon proficiency or bonus feat. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Dwarves</span><span class="c3">: Bonus to Con and Wis is nice, and dropping Cha is just fine. &nbsp;You also get Weapon Familiarity which can save you a feat, and darkvision.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Elves</span><span class="c3">: Bonus to Dex and Int is nice, but the penalty to Con is harsh. &nbsp;You get Weapon Familiarity which helps.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Gnomes</span><span class="c3">: Bonus to Cha and penalty to Str? &nbsp;That&#39;s the exact opposite of what we want.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Half-elves</span><span>:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Bonus to STR, with alternate racial trait like Ancestral Arms you can get martial or exotic weapon proficiency for free which you&rsquo;d need anyway as your first level feat. &nbsp;Add that in with low light vision and the perception bonus and you got a real good choice.<br></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Half-orcs</span><span class="c3">: Bonus to STR again they get darkvision, Ferocity (keep a spring loaded wrist sheath with a cure potion), and Weapon Familiarity in greataxes and falchions. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Halflings</span><span class="c3">: Bonus to Cha and penalty to Str again? Nope.<br></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Humans</span><span class="c3">: Str, bonus feat, and extra skills. Since you have to spend your feat on weapon proficiency anyway they aren&rsquo;t really any better than half elf or half orc though. &nbsp;The &ldquo;Military Tradition&rdquo; alternate racial trait is also great for this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>There are a lot of other races out there I&rsquo;m not going to talk about. &nbsp;I would like to make a special shout out to </span><span class="c8">Orcs</span><span class="c3">, who have a staggering +4 to strength as well as weapon familiarity and ferocity. &nbsp;Oreads, and Hobgoblins are also decent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c7">Class Features</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">Arcane Bond</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- Both options are good here, so either way you should be able to make a solid character.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Familiar</span><span class="c3">: &nbsp;normally they just give you a small passive bonus and have some utility as scouts. &nbsp;If you pick a stronger companion (like a goat) you can use polymorph spells like beast shape or form of the dragon to make it a mediocre combatant, but it&rsquo;s not usually worth it. &nbsp;I would strongly recommend grabbing one of the choices that give you a bonus on initiative. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s effectively a free feat. &nbsp;The other advantage is that if something happens to your familiar you aren&rsquo;t going to be slowed down with concentration checks. &nbsp;If you go this option, look into familiar archetypes, they really step up the feature. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Bonded Object</span><span class="c3">: So you can cast anything once per day which is a huge deal. &nbsp;You also start out with a masterwork object which means you can get a free masterwork weapon at level 1 and swap it out for a ring or something once you have more money. &nbsp;However if you aren&rsquo;t holding your object you need to make concentration checks for everything. &nbsp;Disarm and steal combat maneuvers are a little terrifying. &nbsp;Luckily since you do most of your casting before combat it&rsquo;s not as big of a problem as it is for most wizards. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s much more high risk/reward than a familiar, but muscle wizards eat risk for breakfast, so I say go for it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">Arcane School</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- Arcane school choice is a subtle one. &nbsp;The main reason to do it is the bonus spells, but the abilities can really help out on occasion. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Abjuration</span><span class="c3">: &nbsp;Defenses are important for muscle wizards, plus energy resistance. &nbsp;Not to bad, but not great.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Conjuration</span><span class="c3">: &nbsp;One of the finest schools of magic. &nbsp;Defenses, battlefield control, a little blasting, teleportation, and summoning. &nbsp;Unfortunately a lot of it doesn&rsquo;t help muscle wizards.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c12 c20">Divination</span><span class="c3">: The bonuses for initiative are great, but that&#39;s about it</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Enchantment</span><span class="c3">: Not a good choice. &nbsp;The spells don&rsquo;t help you and neither do the abilities.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Evocation</span><span class="c3">: This has nothing to do with muscles. &nbsp;Nothing at all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Illusion</span><span class="c3">: Invisibility is pretty cool and even though your save DCs are pretty low that works ok for some illusions. &nbsp;Still not a good choice though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Necromancy</span><span>: Although it doesn&rsquo;t directly help your muscle wizarding much it </span><span class="c12">does</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;compliment it. &nbsp;You can raise yourself some some nice flanking buddies after you&#39;re finished killing them. &nbsp;Most of the spells are a bit to debuff focused to help you at all though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Transmutation</span><span class="c3">: Literal Muscle Wizardry. &nbsp;You make yourself strong. &nbsp;Even the school abilities make you strong and the sub school abilities are arguably even better. &nbsp;So much strong.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Universalist</span><span class="c3">: is for sissies who can&rsquo;t decide on opposition schools.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Sin Magic</span><span class="c3">: You essentially just double down on your arcane school, but don&rsquo;t get to decide what your opposition schools are. &nbsp;Lucky for you both Transmutation and Conjuration have perfect prohibited schools for a muscle wizard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Elemental Arcane School</span><span class="c3">: Most of these suck. &nbsp;Metal gives you some AC though which is cool I guess.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">Bonus Feats and Arcane Discoveries</span><span class="c3">&nbsp; - Unfortunately a lot of the feats you&rsquo;re limited to aren&rsquo;t great for muscle wizards, but there are enough that are good that it&rsquo;s ok</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Item Creation</span><span class="c3">: Crafting feats are great. &nbsp;Most notable are wondrous items, but you actually use weapons too so magical arms and armor is a big one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Metamagic Feats</span><span class="c3">: There aren&rsquo;t too many that are really necessary for buff spells, but everyone loves quicken, silent, still and extend.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Spell Mastery</span><span class="c3">: On the one hand reading is for nerds, on the other hand this isn&rsquo;t a great option.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Alchemical Affinity</span><span class="c3">: There are a lot of great spells on both lists that you&rsquo;ll use a lot, but increasing the caster level increase isn&rsquo;t usually to big a deal on buff spells and you really don&rsquo;t care about save DCs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Arcane Builder</span><span class="c3">: You craft faster. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s nice, but it&rsquo;s not a big deal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Balanced Summoning</span><span class="c3">: You aren&rsquo;t a summoner and even if you were this isn&rsquo;t all that great</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Beyond Morality (Su)</span><span class="c3">: really depends on your campaign, but what do you care? &nbsp;Morality is for clerics</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Creative Destruction (Su)</span><span class="c3">: You don&rsquo;t need evocation magic, you do damage just fine by yourself</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Defensive Feedback (Su)</span><span class="c3">: Maybe if you&#39;re an abjuration school specialist</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Faith Magic</span><span class="c3">: Well this is cool. &nbsp;You can get Divine Favor, which is great. &nbsp;If you want to go necromancer you can get Desecrate. &nbsp;You can even use this to be a mystic theurge, although you probably don&rsquo;t want to do that anyway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Fast Study</span><span class="c3">: Makes leaving spell slots open a bit easier if you&#39;re into that</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Feral Speech</span><span class="c3">: It&rsquo;s neat I guess, but has nothing to do with hitting things</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Forest&#39;s Blessing</span><span class="c3">: druids and wizards don&rsquo;t have too much overlap. &nbsp;Swapping out material components is convenient though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Golem Constructor</span><span class="c3">: You should probably have the prereqs for craft construct. &nbsp;Just take craft construct if you want to make golems. &nbsp;Constructs are usually overpriced anyway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Idealize (Su)</span><span class="c3">: This is super disappointing. &nbsp;If it worked with size bonuses you&rsquo;d be good, but by tenth level you should have a good belt anyway. &nbsp;It is great with Transformation if you plan on casting that, so that bumps it up to green, but barely. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Immortality</span><span class="c3">: the 20th level prereq makes this pretty much irrelevant. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Infectious Charms</span><span class="c3">: You don&rsquo;t do enchantments.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Ioun Bond</span><span class="c3">: &nbsp;Ioun stones are cool, but you should have craft wondrous items anyway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Knowledge is Power (Ex)</span><span class="c3">: You know what else is power? POWER! And you have it in spades.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Multimorph</span><span class="c3">: You have a lot of transmutation spells going on around, changing form is some nice utility. &nbsp;Then again it is pretty situational.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Observant Illusion (Su)</span><span class="c3">: I don&rsquo;t think it mentioned hitting things once in the whole description.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Opposition Research</span><span class="c3">: You know what better than being bad at something? Not being bad at something.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Psychic Preparation</span><span class="c3">: You&#39;re a WIZARD champion of the arcane arts. &nbsp;This is an insult to you, but at the same time it&rsquo;s pretty much a silent and still spell which is cool.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Resilient Illusions</span><span class="c3">: If you cast Illusion magic this is going to save your ass. &nbsp;If you don&rsquo;t&hellip; then you don&rsquo;t</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Split Slot</span><span class="c3">: Adaptability is cool, but as a muscle wizard you tend to just solve things by hitting them most of the time anyway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Staff-Like Wand</span><span class="c3">: It would be cool if it was Sword-like Axe or Kick-Like Punch, but oh well</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Steward of the Great Beyond</span><span class="c3">: No running. &nbsp;No calls for help. &nbsp;Just me and you. &nbsp;Yeah, thats sounds like a muscle wizard!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Time Stutter (Sp)</span><span class="c3">: You need some time in a fight to buff up. &nbsp;This&#39;ll give you an extra swift and move action.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">True Name</span><span class="c3">: Pshh, you don&rsquo;t need some outsiders help to beat someone to death</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Werewolf Shape</span><span class="c3">: Werewolf? How cool is that?! (very cool)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c18">Favored Class Bonus</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">HP. &nbsp;Always HP.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c16">Feats</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- Feats are tight. &nbsp;You need proficiency, survivability, attack bonuses and damage. &nbsp;The best option is to go with two handed weapons because you really don&rsquo;t need many feats and you&rsquo;ll get to add your incredible strength to damage even more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Marital/Exotic Weapon Proficiency</span><span class="c3">: pretty much a necessity unless you have weapon proficiency from your race</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Improved Unarmed Strike</span><span class="c3">: Not a great move strategically, but it doesn&rsquo;t get much more muscle wizard than this (probably should wear spiked gauntlets or brass knuckles)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Toughness</span><span class="c3">: Low HP is one of your main weaknesses. &nbsp;This is a huge help.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Improved Initiative</span><span class="c3">: Going first means casting your buff spells earlier. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Dodge</span><span>: Your AC is pretty bad. &nbsp;Sometimes it&#39;s best to cut your loses and focus on other forms of defense.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Power Attack</span><span class="c3">: You have such a low BAB that not only is the penalty to hit going to slow you down, but the damage is going to scale up a lot slower too. &nbsp;Still a decent feat though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Cleave</span><span class="c3">: More hitting is nice, but needing power attack isn&rsquo;t ideal</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Arcane Strike</span><span class="c3">: Magic and melee? &nbsp;This is the dream!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Barroom Brawler</span><span class="c3">: You can pick a feat as a move action. &nbsp;This makes you adaptable and fits in really well with your opening buffs. &nbsp;Only once per day though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Eldritch Heritage</span><span>: Can pick up claws which is cool (I recommend the abyssal bloodline)<br><br></span><span class="c1">Improved Eldritch Heritage</span><span class="c3">: You can use this to get the 9th level abyssal power for a scaling inherent bonus to, you guessed it, strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Vital Strike</span><span class="c3">: Is this ever good? &nbsp;It&rsquo;s not as bad as it is for most martial classes, but still</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Light Armor Proficiency</span><span class="c3">: You get some AC, but now are down a feat and have to worry about arcane spell failure</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Arcane Armor training</span><span class="c3">: Now you can wear light armor effectively, but two feats are lot of resources for 3 or 4 AC.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Medium Armor Proficiency</span><span class="c3">: Like the first one but more. &nbsp;You really can&rsquo;t afford to spend all your feats on a few points of AC</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Arcane Armor Master</span><span class="c3">: +6 to AC for 4 feats, instead of just casting mage armor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Force Dash</span><span class="c3">: Charge faster and with no penalty by expending a magic missile. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Arcane Shield</span><span class="c3">: Not a great bonus to AC for what you&rsquo;re giving up</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Reactive Arcane Shield</span><span class="c3">: Now you can see if it&rsquo;s worth using Arcane Shield and expend the smallest spell possible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Weapon Focus</span><span class="c3">: Your attack bonus is a problem, this helps. &nbsp;You have to commit to one weapon though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Dimensional Agility</span><span class="c3">: Move and cast a spell to move more</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Dimensional Assault</span><span class="c3">: Teleport charge is cool. &nbsp;No attacks of opportunity, no worrying about obstructions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Dimensional Dervish</span><span class="c3">: You can essentially teleport to the next enemy during full attacks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Razortusk</span><span class="c3">: Gain a bite attack. &nbsp;Another great reason to go Half-Orc</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Armor Focus</span><span class="c3">: I mean if you&rsquo;re going to wear armor you might as well milk it for all it&rsquo;s worth</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Death From Above</span><span class="c3">: Increase your bonus to hit on charges while flying, which you can do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Dimensional Awareness</span><span class="c3">: Make attacks of opportunity against creatures when they&rsquo;re summoned. &nbsp;Might be a little situational, but if you&#39;re enlarged your reach is substantial.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Combat Expertise</span><span class="c3">: Trade one thing you suck at for another thing you suck at. &nbsp;This feat makes me sad</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Combat Reflexes</span><span class="c3">: You might have some decent reach when large and anyone who walks through it deserves to get smacked</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Improved Trip</span><span class="c3">: If you can trip them they take a massive penalty to AC and attack rolls. &nbsp;Both are great. &nbsp;Plus if they stand up you get to hit them</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Combat Casting</span><span class="c3">: You should be doing most of your casting before you&#39;re in melee, but it&rsquo;ll come up at some point anyway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Extend Spell</span><span class="c3">: This one&rsquo;s really hit or miss depending on how your campaigns are run. &nbsp;It can mean a buff that might run out early lasts the whole combat or make longer spells last multiple encounters, but if you don&rsquo;t run a lot of combats back to back you might not get much use at all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Quicken Spell</span><span class="c3">: Cast more buffs faster! &nbsp;Have to be like level 9 to use it though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Silent Spell</span><span class="c3">: Important, but situational. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span><br></span><span class="c5">Still Spell</span><span class="c3">: Probably a little more relevant that Silent Spell, but still pretty situational</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Craft Wondrous Items</span><span class="c3">: Everybody needs wondrous gear, and you&rsquo;re one hell of a somebody</span></p><p class="c2"><span><br></span><span class="c1">Craft Magical Arms and Armor</span><span class="c3">: Make better stuff to hit things with! &nbsp;Plus the rest of the martial&rsquo;s will love you</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Craft Construct</span><span class="c3">: Constructs are really damn expensive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Craft Rod</span><span class="c3">: You really don&rsquo;t need any, maybe pick up a lesser quicken, but you don&rsquo;t need the feat</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Craft Wand</span><span class="c3">: Wands are too small to really hit things with anyway</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Brew Potion</span><span class="c3">: Why do that when you can just cast it? &nbsp;Make a scroll it you want to have some situational stuff prepared</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Craft Staff</span><span class="c3">: &nbsp;Sorry my hands are full of real weapons.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c16">Traits</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend taking additional traits as a feat, but if you&rsquo;re starting with them there are some great options</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Balanced Education</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(regional): Is a regional trait that lets you swap ability modifiers between physical and mental stats once per day. &nbsp;This lets you use you incredible strength to be smart or your Constitution to be more charming. &nbsp;This is not only useful, but absolutely ridiculous, making it perfect for muscle wizardry. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Clever Wordplay</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(social): lets you use Int instead of charisma on one skill. &nbsp;This can be combined with Balanced education for some serious strength based diplomacy</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Bruising Intellect </span><span class="c3">(social): lets you use intelligence to intimidate and makes it a class skill</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Pragmatic Activator</span><span>&nbsp;(magic): Intelligence to UMD. &nbsp;<br><br></span><span class="c8">Reactionary</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(combat): +2 to initiative</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Resilient</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(combat): Your fort saves are a little lower than your average frontliner, but this wouldn&#39;t be my top priority </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Axe to Grind</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(combat): hit stuff harder if you&rsquo;re alone, but only then</span></p><p class="c2"><span><br></span><span class="c5">Vengeful</span><span>&nbsp;(combat): a slight bonus in damage if they hit you first. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s not bad, but I&rsquo;d rather not get hit<br><br></span><span class="c5">Dirty Fighter</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(combat): Like axe to grind with flanking</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Hard to Kill</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(combat): Stabilize better. &nbsp;I here dieing sucks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Magic is Life</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(religion): auto stabilize if you were under the effect of a spell (so always)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Mother&rsquo;s Teeth</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(religion): free bite attack</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Dangerously Curious</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(magic): UMD as a class skill </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Desperate Focus </span><span class="c3">(magic): +2 on all concentration checks</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Diabolical Dabbler</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(magic): If your evil and summon things your summons get extra HP</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Transmuter</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(magic): +1 to caster level on transmutation spell and extend a bull&#39;s strength for free once per day</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Called </span><span class="c3">(faith): reroll a 1 on an attack roll once a day</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Fate&rsquo;s Favored</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(faith): +1 to luck bonuses is very good IF you have a bunch of luck bonus (sacred tattoo half orcs)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Heirloom Weapon</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(equipment): free proficiency</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Alien Ferocity</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(regional): ferocity </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Ancestral Weapon</span><span>&nbsp;(regional): not only do you start with a free masterwork silver weapon but you also get a trait bonus to hit that stacks with weapon focus<br><br></span><span class="c1">Arcane Graduate</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(regional): +2 on all concentration checks</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Group Fighter</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(regional): +1 on attack rolls while flanking</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Paragon of speed</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(regional): +2 to initiative </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c7"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c7"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c7"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c16">Spells</span><span>&nbsp;- </span><span class="c3">Spells are hands down your biggest resource in making your muscle wizard. &nbsp;There are a TON of spells on the list, but I&rsquo;ll go through some of the more notable ones.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">Level 1</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- Your baseline spells. &nbsp;Some stop being useful after a couple levels, but some don&rsquo;t</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Shield</span><span class="c3">: +4 to AC for a little while, and it stacks with mage armor</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Protection from (alignment)</span><span class="c3">: Bonus to AC, and saves. &nbsp;Has some other nice things too. &nbsp;You need to know what you&#39;re up against though.</span></p><p class="c2"><span><br></span><span class="c1">Infernal Healing</span><span class="c3">: heal 10 HP. &nbsp;The most efficient option if you&#39;re cool with getting some demon blood on you</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Mage Armor</span><span class="c3">: +4 to AC for a LONG time. &nbsp;Great deal</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Mount</span><span class="c3">: Have a horse. &nbsp;Travel like a gentleman</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Summon Monster I</span><span class="c3">: Have a flanking buddy. You might want to weight till level 3 or so, it has a short duration. &nbsp;I recommend Eagles.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">True Strike</span><span>: Your attack will hit, but spending two turns to make one attack hit is pretty bad. <br><br></span><span class="c5">Thunderstomp</span><span class="c3">: Decent way to trip someone if you don&rsquo;t have improved trip.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Vanish</span><span class="c3">: This is your &ldquo;Get out of here&rdquo; spell. &nbsp;When shit&rsquo;s to hot to handle you cast this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Blood Money</span><span class="c3">: You have boatloads of strength to draw from, just don&rsquo;t overdo it. &nbsp;Maybe animate yourself some dead on the cheap. &nbsp;This really pays off at high levels with stuff like Limited Wish.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Enlarge Person</span><span>: Bigger and stronger. &nbsp;That&#39;s why we&rsquo;re here isn&rsquo;t it<br><br></span><span class="c5">Expeditious Retreat</span><span class="c3">: Only worth casting if they&rsquo;re over 120 ft away</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Long Arm</span><span class="c3">: Extra reach. &nbsp;With Enlarge Person you can hit a lot of people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Magic Weapon</span><span class="c3">: Pretty good until you get an actual magic weapon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Mirror Strike</span><span class="c3">: I think I&rsquo;ll just hit one this turn, and then hit the other one next turn</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Monkeyfish</span><span class="c3">: Worth carrying a scroll of. &nbsp;You never know when you&rsquo;ll need it</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">Level 2</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- These are the real bread and butter of muscle wizardry</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Protection from Arrows</span><span class="c3">: A bit situational, but DR 10 is no joke</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Protection from (alignment) Communal</span><span class="c3">: Like the first one, but you can share</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Resist Energy</span><span>: Great effect and great duration. &nbsp;Good stuff.<br><br></span><span class="c5">Create Pit</span><span class="c3">: Your spell DCs are still trash, but it does create a hell of an obstacle either way</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Summon Monster II</span><span class="c3">: There are some nice choices here. &nbsp;Hyenas are solid and can trip for you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">See Invisibility</span><span class="c3">: Without this I guarantee you&rsquo;ll get your ass kicked against some invisible enemy some time</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Silent Image</span><span class="c3">: It&rsquo;s a useful spell. &nbsp;But with a duration of concentration it won&#39;t work in combat</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Scorching Ray</span><span class="c3">: You&rsquo;re no blaster, but it&rsquo;s always nice to have a backup</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Blur</span><span class="c3">: 20% miss chance. &nbsp;No matter how bad your AC is there is a chance they won&#39;t hit you now</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Invisibility</span><span>: Most of the time you can get away with using vanish, but sometimes you need more.<br><br></span><span class="c8">Mirror Image</span><span class="c3">: Probably the best defensive spell in the game. &nbsp;Even at low levels this is a 75% miss chance on average when you first cast it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c11 c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">B</span><span class="c5">row Gasher</span><span class="c3">: Cool as hell, but it doesn&rsquo;t work if they&rsquo;re immune to bleed, and the penalties take too long to kick in. &nbsp;Still worth it in some longer fights.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">False Life</span><span class="c3">: Temporary HP is often the difference between making it threw combat and bleeding out on the floor</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Alter self</span><span class="c3">: You turn into another, slightly stronger humanoid. &nbsp;Pretty much enlarge person, without the large and a level higher. &nbsp;Does have great utility though.</span></p><p class="c2"><span><br></span><span class="c1">Bear&rsquo;s Endurance</span><span class="c3">: Have a couple extra HP. &nbsp;Good, but not a top spell</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Boiling Blood</span><span class="c3">: One of the few ways to get a morale bonus to strength, but it only works on orks, and it&rsquo;s not too big.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Bull&rsquo;s Strength</span><span class="c3">: Be stronger. &nbsp;Stacks with the size bonus from enlarge person, but sadly not your belt.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Visualization of The Body</span><span>: If you choose constitution it&rsquo;s pretty similar to false life, the dex option is good for AC, unfortunately the strength option isn&rsquo;t as useful for punching as it could be and it costs like 200 gp.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">Level 3</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- Great offensive buffs</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Dispel Magic</span><span class="c3">: It has nothing to do with muscles, but it&rsquo;s still good</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Summon Monster III</span><span class="c3">: Pretty much always good. &nbsp;Maybe a Leopard or a cheetah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Storm Step</span><span class="c3">: short range teleport that also does damage. &nbsp;Great if quickened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Heroism</span><span class="c3">: Bonus to hit and saves. &nbsp;Great duration too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Displacement</span><span class="c3">: Like Blur, but total concealment. &nbsp;You really don&rsquo;t need to worry about AC if you got this going</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Animate Dead Lesser</span><span class="c3">: Make a shitty skeleton. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s more a distraction or flanking buddy than anything else.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Vampiric Touch</span><span class="c3">: It honestly doesn&rsquo;t do great damage, but the healing is nice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Countless Eyes</span><span>: No more being flanked. &nbsp;Cool if you&#39;re fighting a lot of rogues</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Beast Shape I</span><span class="c3">: Natural Attacks spell of choice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Fly</span><span class="c3">: Bet you the fighter can&#39;t do this</span></p><p class="c2"><span><br></span><span class="c8">Haste</span><span class="c3">: The best buff spell in the game, and it targets all your allies too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Monstrous Physique I</span><span>: Like Beast shape, but you can still use your gear<br><br></span><span class="c8">Paragon Surge</span><span>: &nbsp;This spell is just dumb, you need to be a half elf though<br><br></span><span class="c1">Shrink Item</span><span>: One of the most amusing utility spells out there.<br><br></span><span class="c8">Spellsword</span><span>: fantastic for your metamagic rods if you have them<br><br></span><span class="c5">Tail Strike</span><span class="c3">: Gain a tail attack</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Undead Anatomy I</span><span class="c3">: You gain a bonus to Str and automatically get 3 natural attacks</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">Level 4</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- great defensive buffs</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Dimensional Anchor</span><span>: don&rsquo;t let that pansy run away from a fight<br><br></span><span class="c8">Stoneskin</span><span class="c3">: DR 10/adamantine, with a nice duration too</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Dimension Door</span><span class="c3">: Just super useful</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Summon Monster IV</span><span>: Hey still good what do you know. &nbsp;Lions for pounce, dire wolf for trip.<br><br></span><span class="c8">Invisibility Greater</span><span class="c3">: Total concealment and your enemies are flat footed? Yes please</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Animate Dead</span><span class="c3">: Animate your fallen enemies as flanking buddies</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">False Life, greater</span><span>: Still good, but 4th level seems a little high<br><br></span><span class="c8">Beast Shape II</span><span class="c3">: Large animals, higher strength bonus, and pounce. &nbsp;Go be a lion or something.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Monstrous Physique II</span><span class="c3">: like a better enlarge person, with the option to gain a couple extra abilities</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Undead Anatomy II</span><span class="c3">: You get to be a large undead now, and can have DR 5/bludgeoning </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">Level 5 </span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- Some of these are worth preparing, but quickened shield and vanish are pretty great.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Summon Monster V</span><span class="c3">: Ankylosaurus is a stun machine. &nbsp;Dire lions and Xills are cool too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Teleport</span><span class="c3">: Go anywhere you want.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Beast Shape III</span><span class="c3">: You add magical beasts to your list which is neat and your bonuses for small and medium stuff goes up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Monstrous Physique III</span><span class="c3">: It&rsquo;s still decent, but not much better than the second one</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Permanency</span><span>: You can be big </span><span class="c12">all the time </span><span class="c3">now. &nbsp;Admittedly that has some downsides.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Undead Anatomy III</span><span class="c3">: You get to be a huge undead now, and can have DR 5/- and Aura of Fear and elemental resistances</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">Level 6</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- You&rsquo;ll want some of these, but quickening Mirror Image is a must.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Summon Monster VI</span><span class="c3">: Dire Tigers</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Heroism, Greater</span><span class="c3">: &nbsp;Solid bonus to hit and saves, plus some temp HP</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Contingency</span><span class="c3">: Nothing like a buff that automatically casts itself when you draw your weapon or something</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Beast Shape IV:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;You get large magical beasts</span></p><p class="c2"><span><br></span><span class="c5">Form of the Dragon I</span><span class="c3">: Probably still better off with beast shape, but for their size dragons are great</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Monstrous Physique IV</span><span class="c3">: Pretty much the same as the third one with more resistances</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Emblem of Greed</span><span class="c3">: so you need to use a glaive, but get full BAB when using it. &nbsp;Real silly if you boost your caster level</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Transformation</span><span>: Most wizards wouldn&rsquo;t ever want this, but it solves all your problems. &nbsp;Higher BAB, higher AC, bonuses to all your physical stats. &nbsp;Just make sure you cast your other buffs first.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Undead Anatomy IV</span><span class="c3">: &nbsp;Higher STR bonus on large undead and can be incorporeal </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">Level 7</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- I know Quickened Haste sounds dumb, but it&rsquo;d be dumb not to.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Summon Monster VII</span><span class="c3">: You can summon a T-rex. &nbsp;It&#39;s not much better than the last summon monster, but that&#39;s cool as hell. &nbsp;Remember you can always summon a d3 of the previous level.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Simulacrum</span><span class="c3">: It&rsquo;s not punching, but you can use it to make a Succubi or Lilitu to give you a profane bonus. &nbsp;You can make another you which is always fun. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re great.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ice Body</span><span class="c3">: That&#39;s a lot of immunities. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Form of the Dragon II</span><span class="c3">: 5 natural attacks and the strength bonus is pretty good.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Giant Form I</span><span>: You can get regeneration, and good bonuses. &nbsp;<br><br></span><span class="c1">Limited Wish</span><span class="c3">: Just in case. &nbsp;Really good if you&rsquo;re casting blood money.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">Level 8</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- They say you can be anything you want when you grow up. &nbsp;Guess you&rsquo;re a grownup.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Summon Monster VIII</span><span class="c3">: Not many options here</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Clone</span><span>: It would really suck if you died. &nbsp;Now that&#39;s not a problem.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Form of the Dragon III</span><span>: Like the last one, but better.<br><br></span><span class="c5">Giant Form II</span><span class="c3">: Really almost no improvement from the last one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Polymorph Any Object</span><span class="c3">: &nbsp;This spell is awesome. &nbsp;You can permanently turn into pretty much any medium creature. &nbsp;You can turn a rock into a dragon. &nbsp;You can turn a dragon into a sword.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">Level 9</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- Yeah, who are we kidding. &nbsp;You win</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Summon Monster IX</span><span class="c3">: seriously limited at this point</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Astral Projection</span><span>: &nbsp;Taking not dieing to the next level.<br><br></span><span class="c8">Time Stop</span><span class="c3">: Plenty of time to apply all your buffs</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Wish</span><span>: You can do some crazy stuff. &nbsp;Like be stronger.<br><br><br><br></span><span class="c7 c9">Gear</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">Weapons</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- as a rule you just want a big heavy two hander, but there are some other options</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Spiked Gauntlet</span><span class="c3">: &nbsp;You aren&rsquo;t proficient, but it makes a great backup weapon that you always have ready. &nbsp;Most importantly you can cast spells while wearing it, and punch stuff too!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Dagger</span><span class="c3">: Carry a silver one as a backup and to ignore DR. &nbsp;You can also carry a few to throw as backup ranged weapons.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Morningstar</span><span>: &nbsp;I firmly believe that everyone should carry a cold iron one of these. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s 3 kinds of DR you&rsquo;re avoiding. &nbsp;It won&rsquo;t be your primary, but it is useful. Unfortunately again, not proficient.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Staff</span><span>: They&rsquo;re two handed which is nice, and if you use one of these you can even get a magic one later to cast spells. &nbsp;Best thing you can use with base wizard proficiency.<br><br></span><span class="c5">Longspear</span><span>: &nbsp;A simple two handed weapon with reach. &nbsp;Probably my favorite choice amongst the simple weapons, but unfortunately you aren&rsquo;t proficient and there are better martial options if you&rsquo;re dropping a feat on it.<br><br></span><span class="c5">Longsword/Battleaxe/Warhammer</span><span>: &nbsp;They&rsquo;re a little better than the simple options, but not worth the feat for proficiency<br><br></span><span class="c1">Earth Breaker</span><span class="c3">: 2d6 and x3 on a crit. &nbsp;Absolutely brutal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Greataxe</span><span>: how else are you going to roll d12s? &nbsp;Can get it with orc weapon familiarity too<br><br></span><span class="c8">Greatsword</span><span>: The best 2d6 weapon out there<br><br></span><span class="c1">Falchion</span><span class="c3">: 2d4 isn&rsquo;t ideal, but with your strength crit range is important too. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s not worth committing to unless you can get keen on it and have a strength in the upper 20s though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Glaive-guisarme/Halberd/Lucern Hammer</span><span class="c3">: Reach weapons are cool, with long arm and enlarge person you can have a really crazy range. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Composite Bow</span><span class="c3">: You really don&rsquo;t have the feats to be an archer, but carrying around one of these isn&rsquo;t a bad idea.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">Armor</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- You can&rsquo;t wear most armor, but there are a few options</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Armored Kilt</span><span class="c3">: Mage armor is better unless you enchant the shit out of it, but it&rsquo;s something</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Mithral Buckler</span><span class="c3">: The bonus isn&rsquo;t as good as casting shield and it&rsquo;ll be annoying if you&#39;re a two handed fighter, but it&rsquo;s a solid option.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">Magic Items</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- You need all the extra magical strength you can get. &nbsp;Tons of magic gear seems like a logical step.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Magic Weapons</span><span class="c3">: Enchant the shit out of those babies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Belt of Giant Strength</span><span class="c3">: More strength is always better.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Headband of Vast Intelligence</span><span class="c3">: Not as important as being strong, but not a bad idea.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Cloak of Resistance</span><span class="c3">: Always important to have good saves, although yours should be ok already.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Ring of Protection</span><span class="c3">: Your AC isn&rsquo;t good, but if you&rsquo;re determined to make it better this is good.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Ring of Continuation</span><span class="c3">: It&#39;s a bit expensive, but pretty nice with greater heroism </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Amulet of Natural Armor</span><span class="c3">: Like the Ring, but worse.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Amulet of Mighty Fists</span><span class="c3">: Really important if your going for a natural attack thing, works with touch spells too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Metamagic Rod Silent Spell</span><span class="c3">: Someday you&#39;re going to be underwater and really wish you had this, or maybe not.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Metamagic Rod Quicken Spell</span><span class="c3">: Normally in combat you&rsquo;ve got your hands full of sword, but this is so good. &nbsp;You can cast spellsword if you really need to.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Scroll of Lead Blades</span><span class="c3">: Stacks with enlarge person for (effectively) huge size weapons.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Wand of Cure Light Wounds/Infernal Healing</span><span class="c3">: You&rsquo;re going to get hit on the front lines</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c7">Skills</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">Class skills</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- You don&rsquo;t have much in terms of fancy social skills, but your list does have a lot of practical applications</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Appraise (Int)</span><span class="c3">: I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever really need appraise, but it&#39;s useful in theory </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Craft (Int)</span><span class="c3">: Will help with your item creation, but not too important</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Fly (Dex)</span><span class="c3">: beast shape gives you the ability to fly, but you&rsquo;ll still need to make skill checks</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Knowledge (arcana) (Int)</span><span class="c3">: Magical creatures, that sounds important</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Knowledge (engineering) (Int)</span><span class="c3">: I don&rsquo;t know about you but I don&rsquo;t fight many robots</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int)</span><span class="c3">: Aberrations and oozes </span></p><p class="c0"><span

class="c5">Knowledge (history) (Int)</span><span class="c3">: good for plot stuff</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Knowledge (local) (Int)</span><span class="c3">: also good for plot stuff</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Knowledge (nature) (Int)</span><span class="c3">: Animal knowledge</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Knowledge (nobility) (Int)</span><span class="c3">: More plot knowledge</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p

&nbsp;No thanks I&rsquo;m an adventurer</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Spellcraft (Int)</span><span class="c3">: Be a wizard</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">Non Class skills</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- you may not be good at them, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you need to be bad at them</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c18 c7"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Acrobatics</span><span class="c3">: &nbsp;Helps you jump around and prevent attacks of opportunity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Bluff</span><span class="c3">: Great skill, but your charisma is trash</span></p><p class="c2"><span><br></span><span class="c5">Climb</span><span class="c3">: You&rsquo;ve got the strength to be a great climber, but with monkeyfish you don&rsquo;t need to</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Diplomacy</span><span class="c3">: another great skill you suck at</span></p><p class="c2"><span><br></span><span class="c5">Intimidate</span><span class="c3">: Really fits your character, but your charisma is just trash</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Perception</span><span class="c3">: No matter how bad you are at it you always want ranks in perception</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Sense Motive</span><span class="c3">: Great way to figure out who you should be punching</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Stealth</span><span class="c3">: Invisibility kinda covers this</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Swim</span><span class="c3">: Monkeyfish will handle this most of the time, but if you fall in the water it&rsquo;s hard to cast while you&#39;re drowning</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Use Magic Device</span><span class="c3">: It&rsquo;s a really important skill with wands and scrolls. &nbsp;Sadly with your charisma you suck at it</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c7"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c7">Multiclassing and Other Options</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I must admit I&rsquo;m a Muscle Wizard Purist. &nbsp;Playing as another strength caster just isn&rsquo;t quite the same. &nbsp;However I understand that some of you would prefer to play as an arcanist or sorcerer, or multiclass a bit. &nbsp;So this section will briefly address some of your other options.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Sorcerer</span><span class="c3">: They&rsquo;re actually pretty similar aside from the slower spell progression. &nbsp;I recommend the Abyssal bloodline for the strength bonus, or Draconic into Dragon disciple (you still have the option of getting eldritch heritage/improved eldritch heritage for the abyssal bloodline power).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Arcanist</span><span class="c3">: The Brown Fur Transmuter is incredible for muscle wizards. &nbsp;Combine that with all the other things people love about arcanists and this is a great option. <br></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Magus</span><span class="c3">: You only get 1-6 casting. &nbsp;It&#39;s not a muscle wizard at all, but if you want to be good with touch attacks while stabbing people this is the way to go.</span></p><p class="c2"><span><br></span><span class="c1">Eldritch Knight</span><span class="c3">: You effectively lose two caster levels between the martial dip, and the first level eldritch knight. &nbsp;I would offset this with Prestigious Spellcaster. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll end up with a similar spell level as a sorcerer, but higher BAB.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Monk</span><span class="c3">: Multiclassing as a monk gets you access to some awesome ways to punch things better and increase your defenses. &nbsp;Unfortunately this puts a hold on your spell progression and your unarmed damage only progresses while you&rsquo;re taking monk levels.</span></p><p class="c2"><span><br></span><span class="c1">VMC Monk</span><span class="c3">: Only way I can think of to get scaling unarmed damage as a full wizard. &nbsp;It costs a lot of feats, but everything you get is great.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">VMC Barbarian</span><span>: So rage is awesome, but it&rsquo;s a double edged sword. &nbsp;You have to be SURE you&rsquo;re done casting for a while when you rage. &nbsp;I highly recommend Reckless Abandon as your rage power.<br><br></span><span class="c1">VMC Magus</span><span class="c3">: If you want to do the magus stuff while maintaining full casting this will do it. &nbsp;It actually looks pretty solid, but spellstrike doesn&rsquo;t come on till level 11.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">VMC Oracle</span><span>: So you obviously choose battle as your mystery, but your curse is up to you. &nbsp;Your revelations are the big thing her</span><span>e. &nbsp;</span><span class="c17">Skill at Arms gives you proficiency with ALL martial weapons. &nbsp;This not only saves a feat, but fulfills the prereq for eldritch knight without multiclassing as a fighter which will save you a level on your spell progression. &nbsp;Iron Skin, War Sight, and Weapon Mastery are cool too.</span></p></body></html>
