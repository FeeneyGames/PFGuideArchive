this time focusing on the Pathfinder Gunslinger. &nbsp;This is another class that I&rsquo;ve wanted to touch on for a while, but I&rsquo;d almost always forget about it whenever it came to actually putting something down. &nbsp;This class has a lot of hurdles, and a lot of them are people&rsquo;s thoughts on guns in role playing. &nbsp;I plan on covering my thoughts on that in later sections, but simply to start, I&rsquo;d like to simply put out there that the enjoyment of everyone in the group is the most important thing, so take that into account when you&rsquo;re deciding to play this class.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Some people think that Gunslingers are a &lsquo;broken&rsquo; or &lsquo;incomplete&rsquo; class. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll admit that really no other class has nearly as tight a focus on their chosen play style as the Gunslinger. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re a ranged character, no doubt. &nbsp;One of the biggest concerns are HOW ranged you are. &nbsp;Some of the largest concerns aren&rsquo;t really about the Gunslinger, but about their weapons and how they interact with the rules. &nbsp;But these aren&rsquo;t reasons to avoid such cool bringers of destruction who rock the battlefield with the scent of black powder on their hands.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Guns themselves are rather odd weapons, as they&rsquo;re only truly good in the hands of a slinger. &nbsp;Bad range, misfires, and high gold cost for both themselves and their ammo make guns the weapon of a dangerous few. &nbsp;Unless you&rsquo;re using advanced firearms, you&rsquo;re nearly a melee character, which is something to make a note of if you expected to be raining destruction from a distance. &nbsp;Once again, I&rsquo;ve got discussion threads on </span><span class="c7 c5"><a class="c2"

class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">This is the first question that needs to be answered before you can go any further. &nbsp;Normally a no to this question would be the end of this guide for some, but thanks to a new addition to the Gunslinger family, the Bolt Ace, you can still be a sweet bringer of death without needing to sling some lead. &nbsp;Still, if a GM tells you that there&rsquo;s no Gunslingers in their game even after you show them the Bolt Ace archetype, don&rsquo;t press it.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><ul class="c27 lst-kix_53mg0w65grp2-0 start"><li class="c0 c16 li-bullet-0"><span class="c23 c26 c22">What is the level of guns/technology in your game?</span></li></ul><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">This is another important thing to note, as you&rsquo;ll need to be sure of what guns you can and can&rsquo;t get. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t ask for a Revolver to start for an Emerging Guns game. &nbsp;Personally, Commonplace Guns is probably the best setting, since in Emerging Guns, everything is still irrationally expensive. &nbsp;Guns Everywhere would be better, except for early firearms being obsolete, since only early firearms can be true double weapons. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><ul class="c27 lst-kix_66gobb7l7poc-0 start"><li class="c0 c16 li-bullet-0"><span class="c22">Is it worth it to go past 5th level in the gunslinger class?</span></li></ul><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">This is a question that&rsquo;s come up recently with the changes to the gunslinger (signature deed and musket master particularly), and it&rsquo;s important. &nbsp;My personal opinion? &nbsp;No, it&rsquo;s not worth it (unless you&rsquo;re using 3pp, which can help the class remain relevant past 5th level). &nbsp;You&rsquo;re better multiclassing out after 5th level once you pick up gun/crossbow training, since the things you have left are small scaling bonuses that aren&rsquo;t worth the opportunity cost of staying in the class. &nbsp;Does that mean you&rsquo;re wrong for staying past 5th level? &nbsp;No, but you should know that it&rsquo;s more optimal to leave after 5th level in my opinion.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><a id="id.9a0jnhzgq238"></a><p class="c0"><span class="c11 c5">Roles</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Yeah, if you decided to be a gunslinger, you didn&rsquo;t do it to have a TON of different ways to participate in combat. &nbsp;You did it to shoot guns, and the class is tailored to just that. &nbsp;But in this, your choice of weapon is going to decide how you interact in combat, making your decision for you once you decide which weapon is the one for you. &nbsp;Choose wisely, as this will most likely pick your archetype as well.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Revolver Ocelot</span><span>&nbsp;(</span><span class="c5">Pistol</span><span>/</span><span class="c5">Revolver</span><span class="c4">)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">For those of you who are looking to get close up and personal with one weapon and fill your opponent full of holes, this is your calling. &nbsp;Pistols are easy to wield, but require you to be very close to opponents, as none has great range. &nbsp;This will put up a lot of damage (especially with double pistols), but you&rsquo;re almost a melee fighter. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Preferred Archetype</span><span class="c4">: Pistolero</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">The Fear </span><span>(</span><span class="c5">Light</span><span>/</span><span class="c5">Heavy Crossbow</span><span class="c4">)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Thanks to a new archetype, the Bolt Ace, a slinger can even sling bolts, which come with some clear advantages and disadvantages. &nbsp;While you&rsquo;re not hitting at touch, your range is amazing, and your crit range becomes awesome. &nbsp;Also cheaper ammo makes this an entirely viable style even when black powder is allowed. &nbsp;The only problem is you HAVE to go Bolt Ace, but Bolt Ace is awesome, so you&rsquo;re not losing a lot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Preferred Archetype</span><span class="c4">: Bolt Ace</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Sniper Wolf</span><span>&nbsp;(</span><span class="c5">Musket</span><span>/</span><span class="c5">Rifle</span><span class="c4">)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">If you&rsquo;re not a fan of being in harm&rsquo;s way, this is the way to avoid it. &nbsp;The range isn&rsquo;t amazing, but you&rsquo;re out of normal melee range, as well as being able to put up some decent base damage from your weapon. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re using both hands for this, but you&rsquo;re also also making sure you&rsquo;re out of harm&rsquo;s way. &nbsp;Out of any of these, this style most benefits from having advanced weapons, as you NEED a rifle to work at any real range.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Preferred Archetype</span><span class="c4">: Musket Master</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">The Boss </span><span>(</span><span

class="c4">)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">While not the most efficient style, this is the one that will provide you the most versatility, leaving you with something to do in both close range and a distance. &nbsp;This style is assuming wielding both at the same time, although it&rsquo;s also an entirely viable switch hitter style. &nbsp;Unarmed Strike/Cestus is the only way to make this work, since you need a free hand to reload, which means no other weapons allowed.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Preferred

class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">The most basic decisions you&rsquo;ll be making are here, as these are the building blocks of your character even before they spark their first powder keg. &nbsp;Thankfully, Gunslingers are very straightforward, and it&rsquo;s difficult to truly mess one up if you understand the basics. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s not a lot of directions you can take them, so it&rsquo;s a clear and cut path to making sure you rain the field with enough ammo to make your opponent whistle as they fall to the ground.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c11 c5">Abilities</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Strength (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;For a full BAB class, you really don&rsquo;t need too much strength at all. &nbsp;As long as you&rsquo;re making sure you can carry all your gear, this is rather unimportant unless you&rsquo;re practicing CQC (close quarters combat) for by taking Weapon Finesse. &nbsp;Overall, as long as you don&rsquo;t dump it hard, you should be fine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c5">Dexterity (*****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;This is your key stat, you use it for just about everything. &nbsp;You need it to hit, for damage, for initiative, and basically everything else that makes you a demon on the field of battle. &nbsp;Max it, love it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Constitution (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;You&rsquo;re a d10 class, but most of you won&rsquo;t be out of the fray long enough to care, meaning you still need to be able to take hits like a champ. &nbsp;Invest in this so you aren&rsquo;t outgunned too soon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Intelligence (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;With a decent amount of skills already, you don&rsquo;t have to pump this too hard, making it pretty okay for you to just put a few points in here and forget about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Wisdom (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Grit is a thing you like, so is boosting your will save. &nbsp;While it&rsquo;s not nearly as important as dexterity, it&rsquo;s pretty solid for you, and you&rsquo;ll get a lot of mileage out of being the wise old gunslinger about town.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c5">Charisma (*)</span><span>&nbsp;You ain&rsquo;t pretty, you&rsquo;re a killer. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m not big on </span><span class="c3">Mysterious Stranger (***)</span><span class="c4">, but if you want to wander into town and mystify everyone, you&rsquo;re going to need this about as much as you normally would need wisdom.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Favored Class Bonus</span><span class="c4">: Most of you can spend it on HP, but if your race gives you the chance, feel free to burn it on initiative boost or extra grit, as both will probably serve you better than just plain HP. &nbsp;Skills can be nice, but you don&rsquo;t really need a lot more than you already have.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7

id="id.si9lqq4ecx2p"></a><p class="c0"><span class="c11 c5">Races</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Your race is pretty important for a few reasons, especially in what your favored class bonus allows you to do. &nbsp;As long as you&rsquo;re getting a dex boost though, your race is doing what it needs to do. &nbsp;Thanks to this, small sized gunslingers are very viable, not losing any distance and getting valuable bonuses to AC and attack rolls. &nbsp;As long as you&rsquo;re fast and nimble though, you&rsquo;re basically the best gunslinger you can be.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Core</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Dwarf (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Even missing out on a dex bonus, the other stat bonuses are quite nice, as is the magic resistance, although the armored mobility probably won&rsquo;t be too important to you. &nbsp;Probably a good choice for a Gun Tank if you&rsquo;re thinking of going that route.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Elf (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;The dex boost we want, but a con penalty we could do without. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s quite a few racials that can and should be traded out, but aside from that, you can make quite a good elf gunslinger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Gnome (**)</span><span>&nbsp;Nothing gnomish really screams great gunslinger, although their archetype is pretty cool. &nbsp;These are moved up to </span><span class="c3">GREEN (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;if you&rsquo;re playing Guns Everywhere so they still get Gun Training.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Halfing (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Great stats and a penalty to a dump(ish) stat are nice, and there&rsquo;s some good racial trades we can make to customize them into even better gunslingers if you want to go all Billy the Kid on people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Half-Elf (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;An easy to snag dex bonus is nice, and dual mind bumps that will save, these are pretty strong options for a rather vanilla gunslinger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Half-Orc (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Just a hair better than Half-Elves, the amount of things you can trade out to make a better gunslinger is crazy, and you can take these ugly mugs in a lot of different directions. &nbsp;Good for intimidations builds or just all arounders, Half-Orcs know how to sling some powder when it counts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c5">Human (*****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Humans are great at everything, accept this fact and you&rsquo;ll be a lot happier. &nbsp;Seriously, the bonus feat starts you so far ahead that it&rsquo;s just crazy how quickly you&rsquo;ll advance.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Featured</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Aasimar (***)</span><span>&nbsp;(</span><span class="c10 c5">Musetouched (****)</span><span class="c4">) Oh man, these are the stats you want with a ton of other fun benefits that only make you better. &nbsp;Nothing amazing (feel free to trade out the SLA), but the ability score adjustments along make this aasimar probably your best variant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Catfolk (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;While you barely break even on stats, there&rsquo;s nothing that makes these that special, which is kind of sad. &nbsp;They&rsquo;re okay, but a tad on the weak side for what you could choose.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Dhampir (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;No racial trait really helps you here, and there&rsquo;s no great stats either. &nbsp;Shame, since this would be cool, but there&rsquo;s no subcategory that even stands out enough to be mentioned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Drow (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Again barely breaking even on stats, Drow do give some spell like abilities, plus they just look cool.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Fetchling (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Green for mostly the same reason drow are, there&rsquo;s just neat things here, nothing amazing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Goblin (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Who&rsquo;d have guessed these monsters were solid slinger? &nbsp;Great(ish) racials, some custom traits and such that help make them even better, and small size are all golden for these dangerous little bastards.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Hobgoblin (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;For the tougher side of the spectrum, Hobgoblins are just a shade lower than their brethren, making for a tougher slinger with more survivability but less raw damage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Ifrit (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Pretty weak racials here, and while their favored class bonus is nice, it&rsquo;s not enough to save them. &nbsp;Only really great for a build that HAS to go first, as Wildfire Heart is a GREAT racial trait with their FBC.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Kobold (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Racials don&rsquo;t cripple you for this role, but nothing at all stands out aside from a racial archetype that imitates a rogue. &nbsp;Not garbage, but not great either.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c5">Orc (*)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Straight up worse than a Half-Orc in every way, nothing to see here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c5">Oread (*)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Okayish racials, but again, nothing important to what you want.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Ratfolk (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Rats are pretty great here, having solid racials, nice exchanges for some racials traits, and a neat (if not a bit suicidal) archetype, making them fine slingers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Slyph (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;I was expecting more, but the racials just aren&rsquo;t there to make this a solid call.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Tengu (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Nearly perfect racials, but no racial abilities that help you out make this a pretty average</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Tiefling (****)</span><span>&nbsp;(</span><span class="c13 c5">Faultspawn (*****)</span><span class="c4">) You&rsquo;re getting a tail, and that tail can help you reload your weapon with a feat. &nbsp;Everything the Tiefling gets is gold to you, and while the skill bonuses are meh, you can&rsquo;t deny this is basically the best call you can make for most builds that don&rsquo;t have a specific set up needed. &nbsp;Even the base stats are pretty perfect, making this a top tier slinger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Undine (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Solid stats are the main draw here, and some of the other stuff isn&rsquo;t bad either.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Uncommon</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c5">Changeling (*)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;While cool, nothing here is really what you need, an okay but meh race.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Duergar (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Slightly better than dwarves, although much uglier.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c5">Gillmen (*)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Yeah...fish monsters are no bueno.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Grippli (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Battletoad slingers are very nice, as while they don&rsquo;t have any amazing racials, their stats are basically just what you want, and small size is always welcome.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c5">Kasatha (*****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Quite literally perfect slingers. &nbsp;4 arms, perfect stats, and bonus to AC make them perfect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Kitsune (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;A dex bonus and some fun feats make these decent fox gunners.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Merfolk (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Shocking decent, although still pretty meh in the overall, since they still like water, and water doesn&rsquo;t mix well with black powder.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c5">Nagaji (*)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Stats in the wrong place and no useful racials makes these snake monsters lame.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c5">Samsaran (*)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Nothing here, spellcasters only.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Strix (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Flying is awesome, and you can fly with solid stats. &nbsp;Flying is reason enough to pick a bird.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c5">Suli (*)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;No stats you want here, and the racials don&rsquo;t save it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c5">Svirfneblin (*****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;This race is unfair. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s straight up unfair, and you should feel bad taking it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Vanara (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Stats in all the right places and a tail make this ALMOST as good as a tiefling.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Waylang (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Nothing special, okay stats, and all things we&rsquo;ve seen before.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><a id="id.erhxx7dh9x0o"></a><p class="c0"><span class="c11 c5">Traits</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Here&rsquo;s the past that you tried to leave behind, but it kept following you to give you sweet stat boost. &nbsp;While these aren&rsquo;t generally big boost, they&rsquo;re plenty enough to help make sure you&rsquo;re always on top, and never end up hearing someone shout your name in a panicked terror. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s always best to make sure you pick traits that bolster your strengths, since you need to always have the advantage. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m going to try to only give solid options here, although for a more complete list, check out this

something with a great Max Dex bonus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Black Powder Bravado (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Deed attacks are often important, and getting a reroll on an attack is nice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Black Powder Fortune (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;The fear bonus is the big one here, but curses can really mess you up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Larger than Life (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re going to be scary, being big and scary is the way to do it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10

(****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Initiative is so much more important for you than it is for anyone else. &nbsp;This rating is the same for any other initiative boosting trait, pick the one that

class="c4">&nbsp;Boosting saves against magic will always be worth it, great trait to steal as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Human </span><span class="c10 c5">Spirits in the Stone (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Same initiative bonus, but with a bonus to traps added in for flavor.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Religion Traits</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c5">Second Chance</span><span>/</span><span class="c13 c5 c28">Lessons of Chaldira</span><span class="c13 c5">&nbsp;(*****)</span><span class="c13 c5

There&#39;s feats that give less than this, so find you a god and start worshipping for this!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c5">Defensive Strategist (*****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Uncanny Dodge in a trait, need I say more?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Purity of Faith (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Another bonus to your will save, with the added bonus of possibly getting more if you&#39;re up against evil outsiders. They&#39;re probably going to be your enemies, so all hail Iomedae! &nbsp;Or anyone, since the SRD doesn&rsquo;t have deities up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Veteran of Battle (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;An initiative bonus and quick draw in surprise rounds is what god wants for you.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c5"><a class="c2" href="#id.whnftdzcsrb2">Return to Table of Content</a></span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><a id="id.dk6gke972hol"></a><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c11 c5 c22">4.

class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Comparisons have to be drawn between this and the fighter, as the gunslinger was birthed from the fighter, and they share a lot of common ground. &nbsp;But something they don&rsquo;t share is that the gunslinger has a few things, like a resource pool and real class features (Weapon/Armor training and bonus feats aren&rsquo;t a class feature, I will fight you on this), which make them quite a bit better. &nbsp;You are locked into one style (ranged), but you do it pretty damn well as long as you didn&rsquo;t want to do it from too far away.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Deeds will also be noted on grit usage for 2 (requiring 2 grit to be expended), 1 (requiring one grit to be expended), or 0 (simply needing to have 1 grit in your pool), as well as if they can have their cost reduced by Signature Deed or True Grit. &nbsp;They will also be rated on if it&rsquo;s a good use of grit, and the value of reduction.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c11">Class Abilities</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Gunsmith (?)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Not really a feature that can be rated, as you NEED this for standard play, but it is a nice way to cut down on your ammo cost as well as give you your first weapon. &nbsp;Unless you&rsquo;re at a low tech level, this probably won&rsquo;t be your final gun, but it&rsquo;s still a nice one to start with, and lets you choose which style you like.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Grit (?)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;This can&rsquo;t be rated since nothing replaces it, but it is a renewable resource pool which allows you to do quite a few neat tricks. &nbsp;This is one of the things that helps make you a better than a fighter, as well as fuels some of the cooler things you can do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Deeds (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;As stated, these will be reviewed one at a time noting the level at which they are achieved, as well as their grit usage and how valuable it is to reduce cost on them:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">1st </span><span class="c3">Deadeye (***)</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c5">Grit Use: </span><span>1</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Reduction (***)</span><span class="c5">: </span><span class="c4">Yes</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">This is actually a pretty solid deed, and a decent one to spend grit on if you don&rsquo;t have anything else to use. &nbsp;Considering the short range of most guns, you&rsquo;ll probably end up needing this one at least once or twice. &nbsp;This is a decent call for reduction, but there&rsquo;s stronger options to reduce cost on.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">1st </span><span class="c6 c5">Gunslinger&rsquo;s Dodge (**)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Grit Use</span><span>: 1 </span><span class="c6 c5">Reduction (**)</span><span class="c5">:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Yes</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">This is a lot better at early levels, when opponents will only have one ranged attack. &nbsp;Moving is almost always the better call, since dropping to the ground makes you way more vulnerable to getting hammered in melee. &nbsp;Save your reduction for better deeds, this is fine at 1.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">1st </span><span class="c3">Quick Clear (***)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Grit Use:</span><span>&nbsp;0/1 </span><span class="c8 c5">Reduction (*)</span><span class="c5">:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Yes</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Hopefully this isn&rsquo;t something you need to use that often, but it&rsquo;s a godsend for when you need it. &nbsp;Dropping this grit usage is pretty weak, as neither way are you getting a full attack, so save your reduction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">3rd </span><span class="c10 c5">Gunslinger Initiative (****)</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c5">Grit Use:</span><span>&nbsp;0 </span><span class="c5">Reduction</span><span class="c5">:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;No</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">A boost to your draw speed is always good, although the drawing of weapons isn&rsquo;t really that good, and kind of paints you as a target if you don&rsquo;t go first. &nbsp;Reduction is unneeded, as it&rsquo;s already in the best place it could be.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">3rd </span><span class="c6 c5">Pistol Whip (**)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Grit Use:</span><span>&nbsp;1 </span><span class="c8 c5">Reduction (*)</span><span class="c5">:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Yes</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Really a low level deed, as a standard action for an okay attack isn&rsquo;t worth it at any point. &nbsp;Carry a melee weapon and don&rsquo;t smack people with your gun, even it it&rsquo;s cool. &nbsp;And don&rsquo;t reduce it, you&rsquo;re better than that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">3rd </span><span class="c3">Utility Shot (***)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Grit Use:</span><span>&nbsp;0 </span><span class="c5">Reduction</span><span class="c5">:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;No</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">A neat collection of things that&rsquo;ll let you extend your utility a bit, and without costing grit, these are just fun bonus features. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t reduce it though, it&rsquo;s at best grit usage already.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">7th </span><span class="c6 c5">Dead Shot (**)</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c5">Grit Use:</span><span>&nbsp;1 </span><span class="c6 c5">Reduction (**)</span><span class="c4">: Yes</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Oh man, this could have been SO cool, but seeing as it only multiplies base weapon damage and not anything else (dex bonus, enhancement bonus, etc) makes this very weak unless you&rsquo;re REALLY low on ammo. &nbsp;It doesn&rsquo;t even include attacks for dual wielding, rapid shot, or haste. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t reduce this, you&rsquo;re too cool for that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">7th </span><span class="c3">Startling Shot (***)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Grit Use:</span><span>&nbsp;1 </span><span class="c6 c5">Reduction (**)</span><span class="c5">:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Yes</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">The use here is giving you another way to mess with opponents, but the real gold here is that there&rsquo;s no save, it&rsquo;s auto flat footing. &nbsp;Reducing it is nice, but you probably won&rsquo;t use it more than once a battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">7th </span><span class="c3">Targeting (***)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Grit</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Use:</span><span>&nbsp;1 </span><span class="c3">Reduction (***)</span><span class="c5">:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Yes</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Anything but torso is fine (unless your GM says the crit increase stacks), as you&rsquo;re getting quite a few conditions that don&rsquo;t have saves. &nbsp;One round of confusion isn&rsquo;t great, so this is better for those of you whom are popping solo shots rather than raining from the heavens. &nbsp;Reduction is solid on this too, as it&rsquo;s a solid deed overall.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">11th </span><span class="c3">Bleeding Wound (***)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Grit Use:</span><span>&nbsp;1, 2 </span><span class="c3">Reduction (***)</span><span class="c5">:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Yes</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">While the first bleed effect is nice (especially for hit and run), Con bleed is brutal. &nbsp;Loses just a few points for most fights not lasting long enough to make either of these good, but if you can get into a long fight, these are great. &nbsp;Reduction is pretty nice, as it makes all your attacks bleed, which is decent free damage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">11th </span><span class="c6 c5">Expert Loading (**)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Grit Use:</span><span>&nbsp;1 </span><span class="c6 c5">Reduction (**)</span><span class="c5">:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Yes</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Honestly this is a situation you don&rsquo;t want to be in often enough to take advantage of, as firing a broken gun is just a horrible situation to be in. &nbsp;Reduction isn&rsquo;t suggested for the same reason.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">11th </span><span class="c6 c5">Lighting Reload (**)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Grit Use:</span><span>&nbsp;0 </span><span class="c5">Reduction</span><span class="c5">:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;No</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Wow, this is way too late to matter. &nbsp;By the time this comes up, you&rsquo;ll already be free action reloading. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">15th </span><span class="c10 c5">Evasive (****)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Grit Use:</span><span>&nbsp;0 </span><span class="c5">Reduction</span><span class="c5">:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;No</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Such a good defensive boon, but so sad it has to come this late. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a reason to always keep a grit, but not worth reducing just to make sure it&rsquo;s always active.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">15th </span><span class="c3">Menacing Shot (***)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Grit Use:</span><span>&nbsp;1 </span><span class="c10 c5">Reduction (****)</span><span class="c5">:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Yes</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Seeing as this doesn&rsquo;t state it&rsquo;s done as a standard action, you could easily do this as your last attack in a full attack that you&rsquo;re already sure won&rsquo;t hit. &nbsp;Reduction for this becomes gold then, as even as you&rsquo;re not going to have the most impressive save for this, it&rsquo;s free frightening as long as you have any grit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">15th </span><span class="c10 c5">Slinger&rsquo;s Luck (****)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Grit Use:</span><span>&nbsp;1, 2 </span><span class="c5">Reduction:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;No</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">This is probably the thing you&rsquo;ll be using most of your late game grit on, as rerolling a save is super important. &nbsp;If this could be reduced, it&rsquo;d probably be unfair, but god I wish I could be&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">19th </span><span class="c10 c5">Cheat Death (****)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Grit Use:</span><span>&nbsp;All </span><span class="c5">Reduction:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;No</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Probably the best reason to keep any grit around, and while it can be a harsh cost, saving yourself from death is always worth the cost. &nbsp;Maybe you can reduce it, but I&rsquo;m not sure how it&rsquo;d work, so no rating there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">19th </span><span class="c8 c5">Death&rsquo;s Shot (*)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Grit Use:</span><span>&nbsp;1 </span><span class="c8 c5">Reduction (*)</span><span class="c5">:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Yes</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Most guns have x3/4 crit modifiers, which turns them into death shots regardless. &nbsp;Slightly better for 2x crit weapons (it has a decent save), but even then, it&rsquo;s not really worth it, or reducing it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">19th </span><span class="c3">Stunning Shot (***)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Grit Use:</span><span>&nbsp;2 </span><span class="c3">Reduction (***)</span><span class="c5">:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Yes</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Fortitude is a good save for most monsters, meaning that you won&rsquo;t get this off as often as you&rsquo;d like. &nbsp;Reducing it can help make it more consistently useful, but by this point, you have better uses of your grit.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Nimble (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;A boost of AC in the armor you&rsquo;re most likely wearing is quite nice, and will often apply.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Bonus Feats (****)</span><span>/</span><span class="c6 c5">Dares (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Bonus feats are pretty solid, and as a ranged character, you need them to pull off everything that you need to do. &nbsp;Dares however...Dares are there for when you&rsquo;re out of grit and need to earn some back fast, but most dares are very subpar. &nbsp;For completion&rsquo;s sake, I&rsquo;ll review them, as they&#39;re able to be taken instead of bonus feats, although they&rsquo;re rarely worth it.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dares</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Desperate Evasion (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Getting evasion is nice to have, although I can&rsquo;t remember a fight that&rsquo;s had me taking more than 2 reflex saves ever. &nbsp;Not horrible, but probably weaker than a feat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Frantically Nimble (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;A +2 to AC is okay, but you&rsquo;ll rarely ever get back grit from this, and there&rsquo;s better feats than just getting a small bonus to your AC.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Out For Blood</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Probably the best here, probably doubling your crit range is worth it, although since it won&rsquo;t stack with anything else, if you&rsquo;re actually working towards crits, you won&rsquo;t care too much about this after a while.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c5">Run Like Hell (*)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;For those of you who hate being heroes, here ya go!</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c5">Gun Training (*****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;This is why you took the class in the first place, it&rsquo;s what makes guns worth using over bows. &nbsp;Once you have this, you&rsquo;re the best gunslinger you could possibly be.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">True Grit (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;This is tame as hell for a gunslinger&rsquo;s capstone, but it could be worse. &nbsp;Basically two Signature Deed feats at 20th level, nothing to write home about. &nbsp;Seriously, your capstone was last level, enjoy it.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c5"><a class="c2" href="#id.rskpxspolv7v">To Next Section

class="c0"><span class="c3">Hit Die (d8) (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Taking a hit here will hurt your survivability, but it&rsquo;s more than made up for with the class features that you&rsquo;ll be gaining.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Base Attack Bonus 3/4 (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;With guns hitting at touch AC, this shouldn&rsquo;t be an issue, only causing delayed feat progression. With later additions to the class, this shouldn&rsquo;t be noticed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Weapon and Armor Proficiencies (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;This is the same, so no up or down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Skills per Level: 6+Int (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;This is the first major upgrade, helping you transition into a far more skill oriented class rather than the more static original class build.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Skill List (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;With a bevy of new skills, you&rsquo;ll be more versatile with what you can do in and out of combat.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c23 c11 c5 c31">Class Abilities</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Gunsmith (?)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;This still occupies the same section here, and while it&rsquo;s better as you can make ammo for as much as arrows, it&rsquo;s still more of a required piece of the puzzle to work with the class as a whole.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Grit (?)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Same as before, although with more ways to acquire and use grit, it&rsquo;s a far more valuable resource.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c5">Gun Training (*****) </span><span class="c4">A damage bonus that scales PLUS lowering misfire chance. &nbsp;This is golden, and requires you to keep taking levels in the class to take advantage of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Deeds (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Quite a few deeds were upgraded, so why not check them out?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">1st </span><span class="c3">Deadeye (***)</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c5">Grit Use: </span><span>1</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Reduction (***)</span><span class="c5">: </span><span class="c4">Yes</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">No major differences here, still a good deed with a fair cost.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">1st</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Gunslinger&rsquo;s Reflexes (***)</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c5">Grit Use:</span><span>&nbsp;0 </span><span class="c8 c5">Reduction (*)</span><span class="c5">:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Yes</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Keeping you from provoking in melee with weapons that often have ranges which leave you in melee range is more than enough for a deed, although it&rsquo;s not worth it to reduce it, as it&rsquo;s active as long as you have grit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">1st </span><span class="c3">Quick Clear (***)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Grit Use:</span><span>&nbsp;0/1 </span><span class="c8 c5">Reduction (*)</span><span class="c5">:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Yes</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Just as good as it was before, still no need to reduce it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">3rd</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Ricochet Shot (***)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Grit Use:</span><span>&nbsp;0/1 </span><span class="c6 c5">Reduction (**)</span><span class="c5">:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Yes</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Giving more versatility in aiming helps make for a more tactical experience, but reducing the cost here probably isn&rsquo;t a priority unless you&rsquo;re constantly making bank shots.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">3rd </span><span class="c10 c5">Speed Loader (****)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Grit Use:</span><span>&nbsp;0 </span><span class="c6 c5">Reduction (**)</span><span class="c5">: </span><span class="c4">Yes</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Having this both makes two handed weapons viable and cuts down on feat taxes for one handed weapons. &nbsp;You don&rsquo;t need to reduce this, but always having it active could be reason enough to consider it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">3rd </span><span class="c3">Utility Shot (***)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Grit Use:</span><span>&nbsp;0 </span><span class="c8 c5">Reduction (*)</span><span class="c5">:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Yes</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Trap springer is a welcome addition here, helping to add even more versatility to the class.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">7th </span><span class="c3">Dead Shot (***)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Grit Use:</span><span>&nbsp;1 </span><span class="c10 c5">Reduction (****)</span><span class="c5">: </span><span class="c4">Yes</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Even with the improvements, this deed is going to burn through your grit fast. &nbsp;Thankfully, it effectively gives you a full base attack bonus and works with bonus attacks. &nbsp;This should be an instant reduction as soon as you can if you use it with any regularity, especially due to possible improvements through gun masteries.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">7th </span><span class="c6 c5">Interrogation Shot (**)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Grit Use: </span><span>1 </span><span class="c8 c5">Reduction (*)</span><span class="c5">:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Yes</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">While useful in certain situations, unless you&rsquo;re playing a specific kind of game, this is more of a once or twice a game sort of deed. Because of that, please don&rsquo;t reduce it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">7th </span><span class="c3">Targeting (***)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Grit Use:</span><span>&nbsp;1 </span><span class="c10 c5">Reduction (****)</span><span class="c5">:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Yes</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">With the improvements to torso targeting, all of these options are completely viable. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s definitely worth a reduction if you wish to invest in it, as making it a primary attacking type is a great way to debuff foes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">11th </span><span class="c3">Bleeding Wound (***)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Grit Use:</span><span>&nbsp;1, 2 </span><span class="c3">Reduction (***)</span><span class="c5">:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Yes</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">As always, ability point bleed can end games, and reducing this makes it even more reliable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">11th </span><span class="c13 c5">Dead Man&rsquo;s Trigger (*****)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Grit Use:</span><span>&nbsp;2 </span><span class="c5">Reduction :</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;No</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">This is your get out death free card, and at two grit, it&rsquo;s always worth it to hold some back to activate it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">11th </span><span class="c10 c5">Lightning Reflexes (****)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Grit Use:</span><span>&nbsp;0 </span><span class="c8 c5">Reduction (*)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Yes</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Threatening in melee helps open up a ton of options, although reducing isn&rsquo;t worth it for a no cost deed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">15th </span><span class="c10 c5">Anti-Magic Shot (****)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Grit Use: </span><span>0 </span><span class="c10 c5">Reduction (****)</span><span class="c5">:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Yes</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Having an entirely unique way to shut down casters is a huge bonus, and it can completely hard lock mages who weren&rsquo;t expecting it. Reducing it is a fine option if you&rsquo;re expecting a lot of mages in your path.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">15th </span><span class="c3">Perfect Aim (***)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Grit Use:</span><span>&nbsp;1 </span><span class="c10 c5">Reduction (****)</span><span class="c5">:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Yes</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Ignoring miss chance in the later levels can turn a difficult encounter into a one round pot shot party, and reducing it basically means miss chances don&rsquo;t matter to you at all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">15th </span><span class="c10 c5">Slinger&rsquo;s Luck (****)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Grit Use:</span><span>&nbsp;1, 2 </span><span class="c5">Reduction:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;No</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Another great reason to hoard grit, it&rsquo;s very important to manage your grit for this and Dead Man&rsquo;s Trigger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">19th </span><span class="c3">Destructive Shot (***)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Grit Use: </span><span>2 </span><span class="c3">Reduction (***)</span><span class="c5">:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Yes</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Being able to level an opponent&rsquo;s ability scores is huge, but the grit cost will keep this reasonable, even if you do reduce it. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s definitely worth the investment, but know you&rsquo;ll be bleeding out a lot of grit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">19th </span><span class="c6 c5">Magic Bullet (**)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Grit Use: </span><span>1 </span><span class="c3">Reduction (***)</span><span class="c5">:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Yes</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Damage reduction probably shouldn&rsquo;t be too much of an issue, but the ability to shut down all regeneration may be worth it, especially if reduced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">19th </span><span class="c3">Stunning Shot (***)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Grit Use:</span><span>&nbsp;2 </span><span class="c3">Reduction (***)</span><span class="c4">: Yes</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">This has the same issues as the normal stunning shot, making it basically rated the same.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Eagle Eyes (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Perception is the most rolled skill in the game, being better at it makes you good.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Slinger&rsquo;s Quirk (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;The addition of helping you be more of a skillful character is certainly nice, as well as making you more SAD so you can focus on that ability scores that matter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c5">Gun Masteries (*****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;The large new addition to the legendary gunslinger, this is hard to rate singularly.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Aquatic Slinger (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Situational and probably only useful for a pirate game, it does have its uses.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Bonus Feat (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;While generally just okay, being able to treat one&rsquo;s level as their base attack bonus helps you sneak into feats you shouldn&rsquo;t have, like Vital Strike.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Bullet Juggler (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;For those of you who want to dual wield, this is a great way to do it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Charging Shot (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Adding mobility to gunslingers is very helpful for keeping them out of melee range, and this gun mastery makes sure you&rsquo;re nice and safe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Close Quarters Gunner (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Another more situational gun mastery, this one is more of a &lsquo;just in case&rsquo; kind of ability unless you&rsquo;re constantly being grappled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Counter Shot (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Effectively a ranged Deflect Arrows with a roll required, the lack of grit cost helps make this an attractive option if you don&rsquo;t have other things which require your swift action.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Dead Aim (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;A great option for dead shot users, this make sure your damage stays competitive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Dead Runner (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Another addition to dead shot, the mobility granted here will keep you safe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Drill Shot (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;A nice way to break objects and add a bit more utility to yourself, but won&rsquo;t see tons of use unless you&rsquo;re up against animate objects.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Expanded Targeting (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;For targeting nuts, this is a must have, greatly increasing your debuffing options.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Flash Draw (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Getting off an extra attack before an opponent can respond is very powerful, but the two grit cost is enough to make this slightly lower than a must have.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Frightening Shot (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;The grit cost isn&rsquo;t bad and a demoralize check should be easy enough to land, but demoralized isn&rsquo;t the best debuff.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c5">Improved Targeting (*****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;For targeting players, this is a must have, as it adds options for no additional cost and works with the expanded targeting options.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Joint Mastery (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;For anyone using a double weapon, this will instantly cut your costs in half.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Jury-Rig (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;A situational gun mastery that may be useful for some, but hopefully won&rsquo;t be needed often.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Local Legend (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;For those who like to play it up big, this can be a lot of fun and provide some great role playing, but it&rsquo;s dependent on the game to get the most value out of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Long Shot (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Very gun dependent on the value, but with a long range weapon, this can really increase your range to the point where you aren&rsquo;t in melee distance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Lucky Ricochet (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Missing a vital attack can end games, so having another chance to land that blow is worth the grit cost, even if it&rsquo;s only one a session.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Powerful Targeting (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Another gun mastery to buff targeting, this should be on your radar if you want to deal solid damage with your targeting shot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Professional Killer (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Another way to gain grit is great and it can be used against helpless foes once you round them up. It still has normal grit limitations, but it helps keep you topped off, which is aces.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Quick Draw (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;While an upgraded version of the feat, it&rsquo;s still lackluster compared to other options.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Reactive Shot (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Dealing damage before a foe strikes (and possibly dropping them) as well as increasing your defenses against the attack make you that much more likely to survive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Reliable Shot (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Misfire is the disease, this is the cure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Retreating Gunner (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Free withdrawal plus an attack? This is your get out of melee free card, although you&rsquo;ll need the speed to make sure you stay out of melee afterwards.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Scale Breaker (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;This is more of a teamwork ability, as you don&rsquo;t really care about natural armor. &nbsp;The penalty isn&rsquo;t huge though, so don&rsquo;t expect to swing things too much.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Scatter Dead Shot (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Adding to the utility of dead shot is nice, as is increasing the amount of weapons with which it can be used.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c5">Scatter Specialist (*)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Scatter range is nice, but this is a small increase that&rsquo;s only worth it for the dedicated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Sniper Shot (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;A great deed for those who&rsquo;d like to snipe and still do solid damage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Sniping Expert (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;A vital ability if you want to snipe and can&rsquo;t find reductions elsewhere.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Targeting Follow Up (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Adding more attacks to targeting shot is going to increase damage a lot while not sacrificing your debuffing potential.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Twin Shot (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Great at lower levels, but it falls off unless you also take the charging shot deed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Wind Cutter (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;An amazing ability that&rsquo;s situational but also stops you from being hard shut down by wind effects. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re afraid of being useless due to wind, this is the gun mastery you want.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Uncanny Dodge (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;A pretty standard ability, it&rsquo;s useful considering your mobility.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Combat Grit (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;This is how you fuel those big grit deeds, making sure you ALWAYS have something to do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Nimble (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;An AC and initiative increase is just what you wanted, keeping you agile and active.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Gritty Offense (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;An attack and damage bonus is nice, but since you&rsquo;re hitting at touch, it probably won&rsquo;t be your go to use for grit unless you really need to hit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c10">Gunner&rsquo;s Style (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Another huge boost for the class, getting skill unlocks helps increase that out of combat versatility and make sure that you&rsquo;ll always have something to do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Steely Resolve (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Any reroll is nice, and while this is limited (and a bit of a grit sink), for social sessions you&rsquo;ll be glad you have it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Evasion (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Considering your light armor and dexterity focus, you can make great use of this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Improved Uncanny Dodge (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;As useful as its predecessor, another nice ability.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Improved Evasion (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Same as above.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Skilled Resolve (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Buffing a reroll can turn failure into success.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">True Grit (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;The same as before, still amazing for reducing costs of deeds.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><a id="id.rskpxspolv7v"></a><p class="c0"><span class="c11 c5">Skills</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">For such a straightforward class, you&rsquo;ve got quite a selection of skills to pick from, although don&rsquo;t feel bad about taking traits to add others to your list.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Class Skills</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Acrobatics (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;With your dex, you can bounce around the battlefield and really take advantage of this skill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Bluff (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Slingers aren&rsquo;t the best liars, but even with lacking cha, it&rsquo;s your only social skill to use.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Climb (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;While you don&rsquo;t have magic to eventually make this moot, you should pick up some way to fly eventually, and climbing isn&rsquo;t a great way of traveling.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Craft</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Seems like you might need this to make your ammo and such, making this a crazy important skill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Handle Animal (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;You don&rsquo;t have an animal, you don&rsquo;t really need to make them like you either unless you&rsquo;re looking for getting an animal companion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c5">Heal (*)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;This really shouldn&rsquo;t be your job either, leave it to a trained medical professional.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Intimidate (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;I&rsquo;m not big on intimidating others, but you have the means to be scary quite easily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Knowledge (Engineering) (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;This is more of an interesting skill, but in the right hands it can be a lot of fun.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Knowledge (Local) (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Knowing what&rsquo;s going on around town can be worth its weight in gold.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c5">Perception (*****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;The most rolled skill in the game, and you&rsquo;re a wisdom using class. &nbsp;LOVE IT.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c5">Profession (*)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;You&rsquo;ve already got craft, you don&rsquo;t need more ways to get money.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Ride (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;If you can get an animal companion, you need to know how to ride it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Sleight of Hand (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Another dex based skill that can be nice and fun, and helps you cheat at cards.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Survival (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Without magic, you may need this, but it&rsquo;s not going to be too useful in the later levels.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Swim (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Getting tossed in water is dangerous, and you don&rsquo;t have to worry about heavy armor, so throwing a few ranks in this could help save your life.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">While you have a nice skill list, it can always be better. &nbsp;Consider snagging some of these with traits.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Non Class Skills</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10

face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Disable Device (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;You&rsquo;ve got good enough fingers to pull the trigger, might as well see how good you are at disabling traps, especially since you have such great dex.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Sense Motive (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;For a wisdom focused class, you&rsquo;re a good human lie detector.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Stealth (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;You&rsquo;re a dex focused character, and there&rsquo;s no way that you&rsquo;re getting into FOXHOUND without at least a bit of knowledge of how to keep yourself from being detected</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Use Magic Device (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;This

of Porphyra</a></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Whenever a gunslinger would gain 1 or more deeds from the gunslinger class, they can replace 1 of them with an alternative deed. A gunslinger cannot choose to replace a deed gained from an archetype, although if an archetype replaces a deed or if a gunslinger chooses to replace a deed, that deed is added to the list of alternative deeds available to the gunslinger.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">1st level alternative deeds<br></span><span class="c6 c5">Always Loaded (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;This might be helpful early on, but once you can reload as a free action, it&rsquo;s not great.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Dedicated Specialist (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;For those of you who were already going to take Weapon Focus, this is that with a small bonus that opens up a few feat choices.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Determination (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Another deed that opens up new options, Diehard isn&rsquo;t a bad feat to snag.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Feint Shot (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Ranged feinting can be fun, and it keeps you safe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Reload Expert (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Not amazing, but it&rsquo;s free Rapid Reload, which as a slinger you&rsquo;ll want.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Seamless Reload (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re going to dual wield, you NEED this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Sharp Sights (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Another prereq skipper for feats you want, definitely worth considering.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">3rd level alternative deeds</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Bullet Disarm (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Disarm is nice, but it just lacks value against bullet trip.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Bullet Trip (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;The action required is harsh, but tripping is very useful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Deft Shootist (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;A relatively solid free feat, it&rsquo;ll serve melee slingers best.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Drill Shot (</span><span class="c3">***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Not a deed that really helps you, this is more to make sure your party can hit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Gritty Resolve (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Now we&rsquo;re getting some fun free feats, staying standing can be very vital in battle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Gunrunner (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Early game, this is just amazing. &nbsp;It trails off once you get more attacks, but keeping you mobile is important, especially with a gunslinger&rsquo;s range.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ricochet Shot (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;This should have been in the base class, but now you can be Revolver Ocelot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Twin Trigger Shot (</span><span class="c10 c5">****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Another must have for dual wielders, it keeps your standard actions efficient.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">7th level alternative deeds</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Blazing Barrel Charge (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Mobility is key, and this gives it to you and more. &nbsp;Love this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Bullet Drop (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Now you can drop fliers, this is where this deed gets awesome.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Bullet Push (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Not as good as bullet drop, but if you&rsquo;re disarming, this is a cool way to do it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Dirty Shot (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;A grit point to attempt a dirty trick is expensive, but at the same time, dirty tricks are great.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Improved Utility Shot (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Upping your utility is rarely a bad thing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Leaping Shot (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;More of a janky blazing barrel charge, it&rsquo;s not bad if you&rsquo;re cautious on spending grit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Never Down (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;I will never stop loving Heroic Recovery, it&rsquo;s a nice deed chain to get here too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Reliable Shot (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Misfire is the enemy, and this helps you defeat that enemy.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">11th level alternative deeds</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Filthy Shot (****)</span><span>&nbsp;The upgrade here is completely worth it, as is spending a grit to dirty trick on a full attack.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Heavy Pistol-Whip (</span><span class="c6 c5">**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Pistol whipping isn&rsquo;t great, but if you like doing it, might as well make it good.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Impossible Reflexes (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;If you have high initiative, this is a free attack for every combat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Improved Dead Shot (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;This makes dead shot better, but it&rsquo;s still on the weaker end of full round actions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c5">Sharp Maneuver (*)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;The additional damage here just isn&rsquo;t enough with only one combat maneuver.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Sneaky Feint (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Boosting feint can help allies quite a bit, it&rsquo;s worth considering.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Targeting Follow up (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;For those who like targeting, this throws on even more damage.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">15th level alternative deeds</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Calculated Retreat (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;The benefit here isn&rsquo;t really getting parting shot, it&rsquo;s the benefit for spending a grit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Outlaw Shot (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;This is a great way to end off this chain, your dirty tricks will be too good.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Master Feint (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;While you might not need it, the extra value to feinting is always worth considering.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Targeting Assault (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Make targeting great, what&rsquo;s not to love?</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">19th level alternative deeds</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c5">Critical Shot (*****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;The high cost is brutal, but it can also be reduced, making this a game ender.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Full Auto Dead Shot (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;This is what dead shot users have always wanted, love it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Severing Shot (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Shut off mages for an encounter, seems worth it.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span

Unless there is another benefit to a feat like this, I won&#39;t be including skill boosting feats.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c5">Armor Proficiency Medium, Heavy (*)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Since you&rsquo;re not getting Nimble without being in light armor, heavier armor really isn&rsquo;t worth dealing with.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Blind Fight (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;While this isn&rsquo;t great, it&rsquo;s also a prereq for some fun stuff, so it&rsquo;s worth considering.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c5">Combat Expertise (*)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Since it only works with melee, there&rsquo;s not a lot you&rsquo;ll be using it for unless you&rsquo;re going two weapon fighting nice up and close. &nbsp;Only really useful if you&rsquo;re looking for combat maneuvers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c5">Combat Maneuvers (*)</span><span>&nbsp;(</span><span class="c5">Trip, disarm, bullrush, etc</span><span class="c4">) For most people, this would be okay, but Targeting removes the need for a lot of these, and most are melee range only, meaning these aren&rsquo;t for you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Combat Reflexes (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;In and of itself, it&rsquo;s not worth anything. &nbsp;But once you pick up Snap Shot, this is a very useful feat, especially with Improved Snap Shot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Critical Focus (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;For the x4 crit mod crowd, landing crits is of apex importance. &nbsp;Everyone else doesn&rsquo;t need this nearly as much, since there&rsquo;s not as much value in confirming a 2x crit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c5">Critical Feats (*)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Amusingly, the 4x crit mod crowd couldn&rsquo;t care less about these, since they&rsquo;re probably killing, and the other crew didn&rsquo;t take Critical Focus on the first place, making these meh.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c5">Deadly Aim (*****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;You hit at touch AC, you can&rsquo;t possibly miss, so extra damage is perfect for you. &nbsp;This is a no brainer for slingers, and even Bolt Aces are completely in love with this feat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c5">Dodge, Mobility, Shot on the Run (*)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;These feats are a total waste for you, they don&rsquo;t help you accomplish anything you need to do, and your feats are a precious resource.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Endurance (**)</span><span>,</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Diehard (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;While Endurance isn&rsquo;t great, Diehard is a lot better, and it leads to a lot of other good feats, making it a decent call to follow one of its feat trees to the end.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Improved Critical (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Again, x4 guns want this to end encounters nice and fast. &nbsp;Even x2 crits are nice to score more often, also making sure you&rsquo;re rolling in grit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Improved Initiative (****)</span><span>&nbsp;Going first is KING, you&rsquo;ll want this and a trait to help you start encounters before others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Improved Unarmed Strike (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;While you won&rsquo;t take this as a feat, getting it from Monks is pretty nice as a last resort, as well as makes mixed ranged/melee TWF a lot more viable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Deflect Arrows (***)</span><span>,</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c5">Snatch Arrows (*)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Amusingly, this works on bullets too. &nbsp;This makes a very nice defense against other slingers, although snatching bullets, while cool, doesn&rsquo;t really help a lot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Iron Will</span><span class="c17">,</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Improved (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Your weak will save can come back to haunt you, making you vulnerable to all sorts of things. &nbsp;Buffing up this save is pretty important for you so you don&rsquo;t become a puppet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Leadership (?)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;If you can take it, you do. If you can&rsquo;t, you don&rsquo;t.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Mounted Combat</span><span class="c17">,</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Archery (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;If you can get a mount that&rsquo;s not super weak, this is solid, although you don&rsquo;t NEED Mounted Archery unless you&rsquo;re a Bolt Ace since your accuracy is nice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Nimble Moves (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Being able to 5 foot step at all times can save you, as positioning is far more important for you than it is for a lot of other characters.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Point Blank Shot (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;You NEED this for everything, so you&rsquo;re taking this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Precise Shot (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;You&rsquo;ll be shooting into melee a lot, which means you&rsquo;ll be needing this too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Improved Precise Shot (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Cover sucks a lot, so ignoring it is getting you more damage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Rapid Shot</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;An extra attack roll, even with a -2, is the best thing you could ask for.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Power Attack (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Decent if you&rsquo;re going mixed, but not anything too impressive for what you&rsquo;d be using it for.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quick Draw (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;This is thematic, although I think it should come standard with the class. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s important for what you&rsquo;re doing, since it&rsquo;s all about drawing before your opponent without needing an action.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c5">Rapid Reload (*****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Yeah, you can&rsquo;t do without this no matter what kind of slinger you are.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Toughness (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;You&rsquo;re a d10 class who isn&rsquo;t set for melee, this is something you can pass on unless you really feel the need to have a layer of protection beyond your normal HP.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c5">Vital Strike (*)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;You have a version of his as a class feature, unless it&rsquo;s mythic, you don&rsquo;t need this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Two Weapon Fighting</span><span class="c17">,</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Improved (***)</span><span class="c17">,</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c5">Greater (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Oh man, there&rsquo;s a lot of places to take this...As stated before, NO DOUBLE PISTOLS. &nbsp;Dual wielding pistols is possible (and cool), but requires Gun Twirling, which will take up a lot of feats to fully pull off. &nbsp;This can also be used for a CQC style with punch and pistol style. &nbsp;While that&rsquo;s probably a less efficient style, it&rsquo;s also a LOT cooler. There&rsquo;s other feats that you&rsquo;ll need to fully take advantage of this, on top of other stuff you need, so it&rsquo;ll basically consume your feats if you&rsquo;re going melee/ranged, but if you&rsquo;re willing to do it, do it big. &nbsp;Dual wielding regular pistols and revolvers is fine too, but sword and pistol is almost impossible with your need to reload unless you have tons of back up weapons.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Weapon Finesse (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re going to fist and pistol, although you will need an Agile Amulet of Mighty Fist to keep it going, since there&rsquo;s no feats that give dex to damage for blunt weapons.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Weapon Focus (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;In and of itself, it&rsquo;s meh, even more so with how little you need it thanks to hitting at touch AC, but you do need it for feat prereqs, which makes this a necessary evil.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Dazzling Display (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re scary, be scary all around. &nbsp;You can pick this up before Menacing Shot, and if you focus on it, it could be more useful, as well as being a prereq for Gun Twirling.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Shatter Defenses (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;A flat footed opponent is just about at 10 AC, but that might be overkill for how easy it is to hit opponents normally. &nbsp;Considerably better if you&rsquo;re a Bushwhacker.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><a id="id.ox9tome763l3"></a><p class="c0"><span class="c11 c5">Advanced Player&rsquo;s Guide</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Additional Traits (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;There&rsquo;s quite a few good slinger only traits, so it&rsquo;s worth it to snag a bonus to things you didn&rsquo;t originally pick up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c5">Bodyguard, In Harm&rsquo;s Way (*)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;You shouldn&rsquo;t be close enough to use this, don&rsquo;t try and be a hero here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Crossbow Mastery (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re going Bolt Ace, this is how you wield a minotaur double crossbow. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re not going minotaur or heavy repeating crossbow, you&rsquo;re better off just wielding a light crossbow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c8">Disrupting Shot (*)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;You probably shouldn&rsquo;t need to raise the DC of disruption any higher.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c5">Focused Shot (*)</span><span>&nbsp;Int isn&rsquo;t a primary stat for you, nor is wasting a standard action for a minor damage boost.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Heroic Defiance (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Being able to put off a devastating condition for even a round can be the difference between victory and defeat, making this worth picking up Diehard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c5">Heroic Recovery (*)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;...but this...this is garbage, avoid it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Keen Scent (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Scent is powerful, and while it&rsquo;s not as good for you fighting at a range, it still has uses like keeping you from getting snuck up on from out of nowhere.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Steel Soul (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Dwarves can only get better and better by raising

(*)</span><span>,</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c5">Zealot (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Being able to fully act is damn nice, and Zealot is okay since taking crits is devastating, although Master is pretty meh, as it&rsquo;s only 1 HP loss a round.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c5">Deft Shootist (*)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;While the feat itself is good, needing both Dodge and Mobility isn&rsquo;t.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Extra Grit (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;It&rsquo;d be hard to run through grit hard enough for this, since 2 grit really isn&rsquo;t a lot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Hammer The Gap (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;I deeply like this feat, and I may be overrating it, but it&rsquo;s one of my fave feats.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Horse Master (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;If you decided to dip into Cavalier, this will keep your mount strong.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Opening Volley (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;For The Boss, this is important and a nice boost in accuracy, although it&rsquo;s only for one attack, limiting its usefulness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c5">No Name (*)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;A cool idea, but not worth the grit usage. &nbsp;You have a name, use it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Snap Shot</span><span>,</span><span class="c10 c5">&nbsp;Improved (****)</span><span>,</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c5">Greater (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Straight up perfect, threatening 5 to 10 feet around you will shock most foes who aren&rsquo;t aware of it, although Greater is a weak step up from the other

DR that can&rsquo;t be bypassed. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s best with Combat Expertise, but it might not work since you&rsquo;re using ranged attacks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Sword and

this. &nbsp;Post errata this only works once a round, but that&rsquo;s still a decent enough benefit, although you&rsquo;ll need to wait until 20th for a true reduction now.</span></p><p class="c0

the time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">5th </span><span class="c13 c5">Crossbow Training (*****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;This is way better than even Gun Training, since you&rsquo;re

class="c6 c5">Bullet Deflection (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;This will probably come up a lot less than Nimble, since guns aren&rsquo;t super common, but if you&rsquo;re playing in a game with

class="c4">&nbsp;Losing Siege Weapons is meh, one handed weapons is more of a loss, but if you&rsquo;re a Musket Master, you probably didn&rsquo;t care about them anyways, at least that much.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">1st Gunsmith</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Literally a null choice, although it&rsquo;s annoying not being able to select blunderbuss.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">1st Deeds</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Not a huge difference here, but some important changes nonetheless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">1st </span><span class="c3">Steady Aim (***)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Grit Use:</span><span>&nbsp;0</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Reduction:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;No</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Not something you&rsquo;ll be using in the later levels, and 10 feet isn&rsquo;t a great increase for needing a move action to use it, but you&rsquo;re not losing much for it either, so it&rsquo;s basically breaking even.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">3rd </span><span class="c13 c5">Fast Musket (*****)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Grit Use:</span><span>&nbsp;0</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Reduction:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;No</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">And this is why you came, this is the most important part of the archetype, keep some grit so you can use it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">1st </span><span class="c10 c5">Rapid Reloader (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;A feat you were going to take anyway for basically no cost? &nbsp;ACES!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">5th </span><span class="c13 c5">Musket Training (*****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Even better than Gun Training, since you&rsquo;re getting bonus damage to all two handed firearms, not needing to pick a new once each time. &nbsp;THE two handed firearm archetype for a reason.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c3">Mysterious Stranger (***)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">1st </span><span class="c6 c5">Grit (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Actually a step down, as Wisdom was a good stat for you to need to base things like this off of. &nbsp;It does make you personable, but lowers that will save of yours.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">1st Deeds</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Time to see just how far you can get by on your looks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">1st </span><span class="c3">Focused Aim (***)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Grit Use:</span><span>&nbsp;1</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c13 c5">Reduction (*****)</span><span class="c5">:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Yes</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">This is basically your makeshift Gun Training since you&rsquo;re trading that away for something else. &nbsp;This WILL be your reduced deed, as you HAVE to drop it to use it every shot, and it makes Deadshot not horrible. &nbsp;But the biggest problem as it makes you more MAD, as you attack and damage are no longer using the same stat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">11th </span><span class="c3">Clipping Shot (***)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Grit Use:</span><span>&nbsp;1 </span><span class="c5">Reduction:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;No</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Sad thing this can&rsquo;t be reduced, although assuring damage is pretty nice, making this good for cleaning up foes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">2nd </span><span class="c3">Lucky</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;While this is better than Nimble, it wouldn&rsquo;t be as important if Grit was still based on Wisdom.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">5th </span><span class="c6 c5">Stranger&rsquo;s Fortune (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;This isn&rsquo;t worth delaying Gun Training for, although by 11th level you could be getting dex and cha to damage consistently, which is a very passable situation.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c10 c5">Pistolero (****)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">1st </span><span class="c6 c5">Weapon Proficiencies (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Losing two handed weapons hurts, they&rsquo;re some nice weapons, although thanks to some one handed weapons, you&rsquo;re not losing too much aside from a little range.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">1st Gunsmith</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Yeah, you were choosing this already, no big problems here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">1st Deeds</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s all about damage here, slingers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">1st </span><span

class="c5">:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;No</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">This deed isn&rsquo;t too impressive until you reduce it, in which case it&rsquo;s a HUGE boost to all of your damage, putting out obscene pain on all targets. &nbsp;Even without reduction, it&rsquo;s some nice damage added to these weapons.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">7th </span><span class="c3">Deadeye (***)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Grit Use:</span><span>&nbsp;1 </span><span class="c8 c5">Reduction (*)</span><span class="c5">:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Yes</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">By the time you get it, you probably won&rsquo;t care, but you weren&rsquo;t losing anything great for it here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">11th </span><span class="c3">Twin Shot Knockdown (***)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Grit Use:</span><span>&nbsp;1 </span><span class="c8 c5">Reduction (*)</span><span class="c5">:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Yes</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">This is the kind of deed you want to use on your last few attacks, as opponents who are prone get bonuses to AC against ranged attacks. &nbsp;Still, it helps you be more of a team player, as prone is aces for melee.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">5th </span><span class="c13 c5">Pistol Training (*****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Again, this is better than Gun Training for one handers, as the additional damage will help way more than having other weapons also get dex to damage.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c3">Siege Gunner (***)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">1st </span><span class="c6 c5">Grit (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Int isn&rsquo;t a better stat than wis to base grit off of, but it&rsquo;s better than cha.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">1st </span><span class="c6 c5">Engineer Training (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;A bit of an odd swap, Nimble was nice though, so this is a slight loss for you. &nbsp;But for someone working siege engines, you probably aren&rsquo;t close enough to worry about AC that much.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">1st Deeds</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;These are what you&rsquo;re expecting, Deeds to mess up people with siege engines.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">1st </span><span class="c3">Targeted Blast (***)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Grit Use:</span><span>&nbsp;1 </span><span class="c13 c5">Reduction</span><span class="c5">:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Yes</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">When used with scatter weapons, this is actually quite a good ability, as adding your level to damage is very nice, especially once this is reduced to allow each scatter shot to load up on bonus damage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">3rd </span><span class="c10 c5">Scattershot (****)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Grit Use:</span><span>&nbsp;0 </span><span class="c5">Reduction:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;No</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Another very nice ability which really can make scatter weapons a lot more dangerous.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">4th </span><span class="c8 c5">Bonus Feats (*)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Now here&rsquo;s where it goes downhill, as these are two rather weak feats that you wouldn&rsquo;t normally take, which is a shame as this has been a very solid archetype up to this point. &nbsp;Consider seeing if you can retrain these feats, as otherwise this is a scatter shot&rsquo;s dream (if they could reload faster...sigh&hellip;)</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c3">Wyrm Sniper (***)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">1st </span><span class="c3">Class Skills (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Bonus knowledge Arcana is pretty nice, no drawbacks either.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">1st </span><span class="c3">Weapon Proficiencies (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Free siege weapon profs, no problems here either.</span></p><p

c5">Munitions Master (**)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Grit Use:</span><span>&nbsp;1</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Reduction (***)</span><span class="c5">:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Yes</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">It&rsquo;s slightly worse than what it&rsquo;s being traded for, but not by a huge amount, and helps with siege engines.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">11th </span><span class="c3">Skeleton Crew (***)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Grit Use:</span><span>&nbsp;0</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Reduction:</span><span

baddies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">4th </span><span class="c3">Siege Commander (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s entirely optional, so it doesn&rsquo;t help or hurt which is nice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">5th </span><span class="c3">Heavy Gunner (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Slightly better than Gun Training since it opens up new options, even if you don&rsquo;t plan on focusing on any siege weaponry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">12th </span><span class="c3">Master Siege Engineer (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Another optional

Gunslinger Archetypes</a></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Alchemical Hotshot (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Trading out deeds and a lot of other features, this is a more &lsquo;intelligent&rsquo; slinger who has access to tons of extracts and unique bullets, all of which help create a slinger who can live without access to deeds or anything like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c5">Alchemy (*****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;As versatile as deeds are, casting (even alch casting) is better.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Grit (?)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s intelligence based instead, as you&rsquo;d expect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Metallurgy (?)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s best to treat these as your &lsquo;deeds&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Lead (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;The bullet effect is okay at best, but the save bonus against spells and such is the real treasure here, helping you stay safe from magical effects.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Copper (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Being able to decide that you can&rsquo;t be attacked is a huge bonus, and the diplomacy bonus is pretty enjoyable as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Electrum (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Just concealment at this point isn&rsquo;t the best, nor is a minor stealth bonus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Silver (***)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">The damage isn&rsquo;t the big draw here, but being able to possibly pass off conditions certainly is, making you all the more durable by passing off the bad when you can.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c5">Gold (*****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Permanent staggering is crazy powerful, as is a temp HP pool (albeit small) that regenerates.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Platinum (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;The domination is nice, but the save bonuses will keep you safe for a long time, and it even increases your offense.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Intelligent Mastery (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;A reasonable swap considering everything.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Anthem Gunner (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;A supportive gunslinger (?) who actually manages to perform like a decent bardy character. &nbsp;While an actual bard will perform better at the role due to spells, an anthem gunner can do their fair share of buffing when it counts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Class Skills (?)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Adding performance is nice, but does little.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Grit (?)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;And a swap to Charisma, cool.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Deeds (?)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Another Charisma swap.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Song of Strife (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Even with the attacking restrictions, this is a better ability than gritty offense, letting you play buffer to your whole team.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Conductor Deeds (?)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Need to be evaluated separately.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">3rd

class="c0"><span class="c4">Losing a party member can change the face of a battle, so being able to bring someone back from the dead, even just for one fight, can be game changing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Slinger&rsquo;s Quirk (?)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Normal Charisma swap.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Harmonious Resolve (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;A slight improvement since Charisma has more skills than Wisdom.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Anthem&rsquo;s Style (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Same as above, overall an upgrade.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Speedy Song (****)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Now you can use things like dead shot and targeting and start a

class="c0"><span class="c3">Black Flag Bandit (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;For a nautical game, the black flag bandit will do exactly what you&rsquo;d expect it to, working well with nautical combat and helping to boast a very ship friendly playstyle. &nbsp;Knock a star off if you&rsquo;re not playing a nautial game, as you need to be on the high seas to use this archetype to the fullest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Weapon and Armor Proficiencies (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;You lose two handers, but gain some swords, so pretty even.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Gunsmith (?)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;A slight buff to be able to add a flag to it, but no huge changes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Pirate Deeds

infrequently used deed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Port Royalty (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;The biggest issue with renown was the time it took to change locations, this gets rid of that. For the kind of game in which you&rsquo;d expect this archetype to work, this is a lot of fun.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Raise the Flag (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;A party buff and some flavorful bonuses make this a solid trade.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Bullet Wizard (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;It does what it says on the tin, a casting wizard. &nbsp;The big hindrance here is the amount of deeds and gun masteries lost, making the class reliant on spells to separate itself out from the pack. &nbsp;Spells are powerful, but the archetype feels a little less unique compared to others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Skills (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;An overall fair trade, nothing too crazy here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Weapon and Armor Proficiencies (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;For the archetype, this is standard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13

on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Magic Gun (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Bonded objects are nice, as is being able to upgrade your gun without needing feats.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Arcane Shot (***)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">While a nice ability, the gun mastery cost is steep, making this an even trade.</span></p><p

class="c4">&nbsp;This is good, but slightly worse if you allow traits that do this already.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Arcane Artillery (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Considering what it&rsquo;s giving up and that it&rsquo;s dealing energy damage, this barely pulls ahead in the trade, being situationally better.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Intelligent Resolve (?)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Another intelligence swap.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Genius Style (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Slightly worse, since generally Wisdom skills

class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Crossbow Killer (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;The standard crossbow replacement, it&rsquo;s effectively the base class but with considerations made for a

saved, helping you create your build faster.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Gun Masteries (?)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;A few deeds that won&rsquo;t work, nothing much else to say.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c5">Weapon Training (*****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;This is a much better trade than gritty offense, opening up tons of options.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Demolition Soldier (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;A simple archetype that trades some gun masteries for a new way of debuffing with bombs. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s always the fear of nova-ing with bombs and having to split discovers and gun masteries is rough, but the trade off is worth it for the versatility bombs give.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Bombs (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;So we&rsquo;re getting slightly weaker bombs for a few deeds and gritty offense, a fair trade.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Gunsmithing (?)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Requiring a pistol to start is fine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Bomb Mastery (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;While opening up discoveries is nice, they&rsquo;re competing with your gun masteries, meaning you&rsquo;ll have to split focus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Bomb Bullet (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;The damage here is going to be pretty nice, but losing the gun masteries is hurting your customization is a hard pill to swallow. &nbsp;Overall it&rsquo;s worth it, but just barely.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Faded Stranger (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;For those who want to play someone &lsquo;just passing through&rsquo;, the archetype pays a heavy cost losing all combat grit, and the abilities fluctuate from being worth it to being not good enough. For games that won&rsquo;t hit 19th level, I&rsquo;d knock off a star.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Gun Mastery (?)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;No local legend, no problem.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Unseen (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;While the stealth bonus is nice, Perception is the best skill for a reason.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">No Face (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Giving a unique use to a skill is certainly worthwhile, and a fair trade here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Fade Away (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Losing combat grit is a bitter pill to swallow, but invisibility is so good that it&rsquo;s reasonable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">No History (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;While gaining a lot of unique out of combat utility, the cost of combat grit here is too much.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">No Existence (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;The suite of abilities given here is definitely worth the cost, giving you the ability to deliver negative levels and be impossibly stealthy.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Firearm Striker (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;A more &lsquo;monk-like&rsquo; gunslinger, this is perfect for people who want to gun-fu. &nbsp;Overall, the archetype plays about as well as the core class, but absolutely demands you keep at least 1 grit or less a ton of your abilities shut off, making it slightly more risky than others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Weapon and Armor Proficiencies (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Losing light armor isn&rsquo;t great, but it&rsquo;s made up for later.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">AC Bonus (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;And the reason why you lose light armor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Martial Grit (?)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;More ways to gain grit, cool.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Striker Deeds (?)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Reviewed separately.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">1st </span><span class="c3">Iron Knuckle (***)</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c5">Grit:</span><span>&nbsp;0 </span><span class="c8 c5">Reduction (*)</span><span class="c5">:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Yes</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Free Weapon Finesse and Improved Unarmed Strike, good times.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">3rd </span><span class="c3">Close Combat (***)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Grit:</span><span>&nbsp;0 </span><span class="c8 c5">Reduction (*)</span><span class="c5">:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Yes</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Cutting down on costs is always solid.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">3rd </span><span class="c3">Steel Fist (***)</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c5">Grit:</span><span>&nbsp;0 </span><span class="c8 c5">Reduction (*)</span><span class="c5">:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Yes</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">This is a huge damage boost, definitely a plus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">7th </span><span class="c10 c5">Gun Flurry (****)</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c5">Grit:</span><span>&nbsp;1 </span><span class="c5">Reduction</span><span class="c5">:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;No</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">A huge boost in offensive potential and movement, this is a great way to dart around the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">11th </span><span class="c3">Empowered Firearm (***)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Grit:</span><span>&nbsp;1 </span><span class="c5">Reduction</span><span class="c5">:</span><span>&nbsp;No</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">For most one handed firearms, this is going to be a large bump to their damage and it last for a decent amount.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Light Hands (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;While it takes a while to get here, using dex to damage is a huge damage boost.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Martial Offense (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Basically what you&rsquo;d expect, gritty offense working on unarmed strikes.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Living Turret (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;The &lsquo;tank&rsquo; archetype, the living turret trades mobility for survivability in equal measure. It&rsquo;s hard to damage this beast but they are a sitting duck for any spells that come their way, making it an even trade off for those who want to stand and deliver.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Weapon and Armor Proficiencies (?)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Expected swaps here, nothing crazy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Heavy Gunsmith (?)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Culverin for a start weapon, we going big!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Turret Stance (***)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Trading mobility to make you a tank, turret stance is a huge part of the archetype, and it provides a lot of defensive bonuses at the cost of moving. It&rsquo;s a huge investment, but one that certainly pays off, even if the damage reduction is a little low.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Adamant Guard (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Sadly we lose the initiative bonus, but it&rsquo;s all towards making turret stance better.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Heavy Artillery (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;And now you&rsquo;re firing even bigger weapons, the double hackbut is a monster.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Muzzle Roarer (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;A very eclectic archetype, the muzzle roarer has a very unique set of abilities which give a smattering of utility to your slinger, opening up options which can help with their versatility.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Alignment and Patron Deity (?)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;More a flavor thing, no real issues unless you have a weird multiclass.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Weapon and Armor Proficiencies (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;We lose martial weapons, but we gain a unique feat. &nbsp;Overall, I&rsquo;d consider this a net win.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c6">Skills (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Losing skill points and class skills, not great.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Unwholesome Aura (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;For the most part, this aura shouldn&rsquo;t be a big deal, but could cause problems.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Cursed Countenance (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Gaining an oracle curse is a mixed blessing, but provides new and unique options.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Blasted Clear to Hell (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;The utility gained from this is about what was lost earlier, making it basically an improved drill shot gun mastery.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Dirty Fighter, Ugly Bastard (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Opening up ninja tricks is a huge benefit as there&rsquo;s several great options.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Roar of the Gun (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;The spell-like abilities this opens up are well worth losing evasion and such.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Bad Deeds (?)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Reviewed separately, although unique in that that they are optional.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">1st </span><span class="c6 c5">Branding Barrel (**)</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c5">Grit:</span><span>&nbsp;0/1/2 </span><span class="c8 c5">Reduction (*)</span><span class="c5">:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Yes</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">It&rsquo;s flavorful, but branding someone will rarely be worth losing one of the base deeds.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">1st </span><span class="c3">Doomwalker (***)</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c5">Grit:</span><span>&nbsp;1 </span><span class="c8 c5">Reduction (*)</span><span class="c5">:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Yes</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">The save bonuses are minor, but being able to reduce fear effects for grit can save you from fleeing in terror when the chips are down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">1st </span><span class="c10 c5">Where&rsquo;re Ruin Blows (****)</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c5">Grit:</span><span>&nbsp;0/1/2 </span><span class="c8 c5">Reduction (*)</span><span class="c5">:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Yes</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Adding some divination to your arsenal is only going to help, and the cheap cost of this ritual at later levels is &nbsp;trivial for the kind of information it can yield.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Pale Slinger (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Proving to be a hell of a debuffer, the pale slinger trades some uncomfortableness in their aura of misfortune to be a top tier debuffer who can shut down other characters without even needing to act. For people who want to debuff, this is your archetype.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Aura of Misfortune (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;The base effect isn&rsquo;t very relevant, and the area is somewhat small to start. Overall, this could be a hassle for other party members if not played carefully.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Hex Mastery (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Hexes are great, and while you can&rsquo;t select whatever ones you want, you can certainly grab some very powerful ones, and even major hexes can be selected eventually.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Curse Shot (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Adding damage to debuffs, this opens up a lot of options, although it won&rsquo;t work with targeting or dead shot style builds and eats up a few gun masteries.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Cruel Malediction (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;A -2 doesn&rsquo;t seem like a lot, but along with all the other ways you can debuff with hexes, this can help you stick those important debuffs. &nbsp;It gets MUCH better when you can regain grit too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Hopeless Aura (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Rerolls aren&rsquo;t the most common, but when you shut one down, you can completely shut down a creature, making this situationally amazing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Death Aura (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;The amount of control this gives you of the battlefield is amazing, shutting down fast healing, regeneration, and other abilities. &nbsp;As long as you can stay in range, this will give you a major edge on most foes who want to heal up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c5">Last Curse (*****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Grand hexes are amazing, and will always be better than gun masteries.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Rumslinger (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;This one is hard to rate, as while drunken grit is AMAZING, the other parts of the archetype are okay to very bad. &nbsp;As a whole, this archetype will allow you to straight up spam grit as long as you have the drinks to manage it, so it still proves to be very powerful at later levels.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c5">Drunken Grit (*****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Being able to replenish your grit completely between encounters with the caveat that you have to drink makes it a far more free resource, although be careful your game doesn&rsquo;t use addition rules. The amount of grit starts lower at first, but quickly increases and includes some added mobility.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Drunken Deeds (?)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Reviewed separately.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">7th </span><span class="c6 c5">Wobbling Shot (**)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Grit:</span><span>&nbsp;1/2/3/4 </span><span class="c10 c5">Reduction (****)</span><span class="c5">:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Yes</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">By itself, this is an expensive way to try and make sure you hit, but reduced, this is an awesomely cheap way to make sure you hit, making this a great option. It&rsquo;s not worth spending the additional grit, just stick with one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">11th </span><span class="c3">Drunken Courage (***)</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c5">Grit:</span><span>&nbsp;1 </span><span class="c8 c5">Reduction (*)</span><span class="c5">:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Yes</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">This is effectively immunity to fear effects, and while you could reduce it, the duration is enough to the point where there&rsquo;s no reason to unless you really want to be immune. As it lists expert reloading as the deed it replaces, it should instead replace bleeding wound.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c5">Firewater (*)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;In no way is this anywhere close to worth nimble.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c5">Rain of Fire (*)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;While cool, fire damage at this level is laughable and not worth reducing the cost of deeds.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Sky Rider (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Essentially an archetype for those who want a flying mount, this kicks off soon enough that you&rsquo;ll be in the air around the same time as other party members, although it hurts your ability to be a more skillful character. For those wanting to play a more skill focused character, knock this down a star.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Animal Companion (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;An animal companion, even one chosen for you, is easily worth what it replaces. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c5">Wild Empathy (*)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Not even close to worth eagle eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Aerial Mount (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;A single nimble is worth this feat, as the options given are both awesome.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Skybound (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Having a flying mount this early can change the game for you.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Solemn Traveler (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;For those looking to play a more judgement focused character, a solemn traveler can really fit that vibe. The lost accuracy from losing gritty offense shouldn&rsquo;t matter too much, and always having the option to demoralize (except against mindless foes) helps keep certain strategies open.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Traveler&rsquo;s Path (?)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Mostly flavor, no huge gameplay effects.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Mount (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;For what&rsquo;s given up, the mount is pretty fair.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Traveler&rsquo;s Presence (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Intimidate has tactical use, but Perception is still better.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Focused Traveler (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;The added SADness from slinger&rsquo;s quirk is just barely worth more than a detect of your choice, even if it can be situationally useful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Traveler&rsquo;s Judgement (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;The usefulness of being able to pick a judgement at will outstrips the cost of what&rsquo;s traded out, giving just what&rsquo;s needed whenever it&rsquo;s needed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Traveler&rsquo;s Terror (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Canceling fear immunity is a beautiful thing, and while it&rsquo;s annoying that you can&rsquo;t turn it off, it opens up way more creatures to fear based strategies.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Technological Shootist (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;There&rsquo;s not much to say here, this is the archetype to use if you&rsquo;re using tech weapons. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s only for that purpose, so if you&rsquo;re going tech, here you go.</span></p><p class="c0"><span

class="c10 c5">Reduction (****)</span><span class="c5">:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Yes</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">By itself, it&rsquo;s meh. &nbsp;But if you reduce it, it&rsquo;s basically free ammo forever assuming your weapon only requires one charge to use.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">1st </span><span class="c6 c5">Reliable (**)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Grit:</span><span>&nbsp;1 </span><span class="c10 c5">Reduction (****)</span><span class="c5">:</span><span>&nbsp;Yes</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Another deed that&rsquo;s meh on its own, but awesome if reduced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">3rd </span><span class="c3">Speed Battery (***)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Grit:</span><span>&nbsp;1 </span><span class="c8 c5">Reduction (*)</span><span class="c5">:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Yes</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Being able to reload a weapon quickly is your goal, this helps get you there.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><a id="id.rnz1ijtzew7a"></a><p class="c0"><span class="c11 c5">Multiclassing</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Seeing as you&rsquo;re a non spellcasting class, multiclassing is basically golden for you. &nbsp;A lot of you may bail after picking up gun training, and that&rsquo;s fine, it&rsquo;s a great class feature. &nbsp;But some of you may want to dip off and pick up other neat things from other classes, and generally other non spellcasting classes are going to be the best place to look for these goodies. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll be considering each dip to only last 1-2 levels unless there&rsquo;s something really important at 3rd or 4th level, but any further than that and you&rsquo;re not really dipping.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Straight talk here, unless you REALLY like a later class feature, you&rsquo;re almost certainly better off multiclassing after 5th level when you get gun training. &nbsp;Most of the later features aren&rsquo;t amazing enough to stay, and with the errata to Signature Deed, you can probably pass on it reliably. &nbsp;Consider your midgame a large quest to get the best combination of feats that you can to make a true master of the gun.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Core</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Barbarian (**)</span><span>&nbsp;(</span><span class="c3">Urban Barbarian</span><span>/</span><span class="c3">Savage Technologist (***)</span><span class="c4">) Both of these archetypes give you a dex boost, which is what you need. &nbsp;Both also add some skills to your class list which can &nbsp;be nice. &nbsp;Savage Technologist is barely better, as it provides a band aid to help CQC before the feats go off with a limited amount of TWF and Sword &amp; Pistol style a day, which shouldn&rsquo;t be too bad since you should have a decent con score. &nbsp;Two levels should be as deep as you need to go, getting you a rage power and speed boost as well.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Bard (**)</span><span>&nbsp;(</span><span class="c3">Juggler (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;You&rsquo;re only here for two levels of Juggler, but with it you&rsquo;ve got yet another way to dual wield pistols which is never a bad thing. &nbsp;It also provides you with quite a few nice class skills, as well as some spells that will be even better if you&rsquo;re cha based, and picking up Evasion early.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Fighter (***)</span><span>&nbsp;(</span><span class="c3">Mutation Warrior (***)</span><span>/</span><span class="c10 c5">Trench Fighter</span><span>/</span><span class="c10 c5">Unbreakable</span><span>/</span><span class="c10 c5">Weapon Master (****)</span><span>) Even the base fighter is good for the classic 2 level dip, these three archetypes deserve special mention. &nbsp;Mutation Warrior is giving you a +4 to dex and a +2 natural armor for 30 mins a day, and if you&rsquo;ve got time, you can brew another. &nbsp;Trench Fighter is what you love 2 levels earlier, and pushes up any archetype that doesn&rsquo;t get it (</span><span class="c10 c5">EXPERIMENTAL GUNSLINGER (****)</span><span class="c4">) by two ratings. &nbsp;And Unbreakable pops you three feats instead of two if you wanted to go the Diehard route. &nbsp;Weapon Master is nice if you want damage for early Weapon Training.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Monk (***)</span><span>&nbsp;(</span><span class="c3">Maneuver Master</span><span class="c17">/</span><span class="c3">Master of Many Styles</span><span>/</span><span class="c3">Monk of the Iron Mountain</span><span>/</span><span class="c3">Sohei</span><span>/</span><span class="c3">Terra-Cotta Monk (***)</span><span>/</span><span class="c10 c5">Zen Archer</span><span>/</span><span class="c10 c5">Far Thrower Monk (****)</span><span class="c4">) Even without an archetype or punching someone, you&rsquo;re getting a +3 to all saves, two feats, evasion, and a speed boost for two levels, which is pretty nice. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s also the class you&rsquo;ll have to take to get melee and guns. &nbsp;Maneuver Master is probably the best way to go for maneuvers in close, although aside from Dirty Trick, not many are that useful. &nbsp;Master of Many Styles is nice for The Boss to pick up style feats or Vulcan Raven to easily stand. &nbsp;Iron Mountain is nice for if you want to be just a tad tougher, while Sohei lets you get a minor initiative boost and always act in surprise rounds, and Terra-Cotta lets you work that much better as a trap detector. &nbsp;Zen Archer can pick you up 3 feats, including Point Blank Master too, making it a great dip option, although Far Thrower nets you 3 feats for two levels including Quick Draw if you&rsquo;re going for Gun Twirling</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Paladin (***)</span><span>&nbsp;(</span><span class="c3">Divine Hunter</span><span>/</span><span class="c3">Holy Gu (***)n</span><span class="c4">) Mysterious strangers only, but you&rsquo;re getting that classic cha to saves that we all know and love, as well as a nice boost to your will save aside from that. &nbsp;Divine Hunter even snags you Precise Shot without Point Blank Shot, Holy gun snags you extra grit and another way to burn grit to damage evil as a standard action (might not stack with Focused Aim since they&rsquo;re both cha to damage though), which drops off in usefulness at later levels.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Ranger (**)</span><span>&nbsp;(</span><span class="c3">Freebooter (***)</span><span class="c4">) The one real advantage you get is being able to take Precise Shot at 2nd level without needing Point Blank shot, although if you went fighter you&rsquo;d get both without the +3 to reflex save (not something NEED), so that&rsquo;s really your call. &nbsp;But there are better fighter archetypes, since your best is Freebooter to give the entire party a boost against one target until it&rsquo;s dead, and there&rsquo;s no limit on its use.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c5">Rogue (*)</span><span>&nbsp;(</span><span class="c3">Unchained (***)</span><span class="c4">) Never thought I&rsquo;d include the Rogue here, but thanks to the unchained version, you can get the BEST dex to damage option in the game with just a 3 level dip. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a lot better for Boss slingers, since you get that cestus up to full power a lot quicker. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d take this dip at 8th level, depending on if you want to focus on melee or ranged.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Non Core</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Alchemist (***)</span><span>&nbsp;(</span><span class="c3">Trap Breaker</span><span>/</span><span class="c3">Grenadier (***)</span><span>) Two levels here can get you a bonus arm that&rsquo;ll make sure you&rsquo;re dual wielding like an MGS villain, as well as picking up Mutagen, a few extracts (free healing potions daily), and a few weak bombs. &nbsp;It also gives you the chance to take Alchemist discoveries as feats which is nice, since you could pick up a familiar and a few other things for fun. &nbsp;Trap Breaker is fine if you want trapfinding (nice little bonus), and Grenadier is fun for adding alchemical items to your shots, although it limits you to one attack a round.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c3 c14"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Cavalier (***)</span><span>&nbsp;(</span><span class="c10 c5">Luring Cavalier (****)</span><span class="c4">) This is a weird call, as going 4 levels deep can make you able to take Horse Master, which can give you a full progression animal companion. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s probably the best part of dipping Cavalier, and it&rsquo;ll be the length considered for dipping here. &nbsp;Luring Cavalier is best though, as it suits your ranged style perfectly and lets you actually use your challenge at a range.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Swashbuckler (***)</span><span>&nbsp;(</span><span class="c10 c5">Daring Infiltrator</span><span>/</span><span class="c10 c5">Inspired Blade</span><span>/</span><span class="c10 c5">Musketeer</span><span>/</span><span class="c10 c5">Picaroon (****)</span><span class="c4">) A 1 level dip nets you a panache pool (stacks with grit), super weapon finesse (removes the need for Effortless Lace), and a few neat deeds, although these are only great for those of you who plan on being in the fray. &nbsp;Daring Infiltrators are quite nice, as by text they get a feat at 2nd level, and Inspired Blades are nice for those who plan on using a rapier as their melee weapon and getting at least 2 more grit for free. &nbsp;Musketeer is in an odd place, as you&rsquo;re getting some nice feats for free, but if you&rsquo;re going for Muskets, you&rsquo;re probably taking Musket Master, so you don&rsquo;t need Rapid Reload again as well as needing Effortless Lace to make your rapier light for TWF. &nbsp;Picaroon is great for CQC players, since you&rsquo;re getting quite a few good feats you need for free.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">A note about Variant Multiclassing<br></span><span class="c4">Don&rsquo;t. &nbsp;You need every feat you can get, and then some, and nothing is worth as much as feats to you.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><a id="id.vyaiwnbw12mv"></a><p class="c0"><span class="c11 c5">Prestige Classes</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">There&rsquo;s probably more that are worth checking out, but there&rsquo;s one in particular that is of special note, and that&rsquo;s the Shield/Grand Marshal. &nbsp;A thing to note is that since these aren&rsquo;t actually gunslinger levels, this class IS pushing you back from Signature Deed, and if you finish it, you won&rsquo;t get it, so be careful here. &nbsp;Also this class is not Bolt Ace friendly at all, it&rsquo;s only for pure slinger, especially ones who live and work in cities.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c22">Shield</span><span class="c17">/</span><span class="c3 c22">Grand Marshal</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(***)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Prerequisites (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;The only thing here you don&rsquo;t really care about is Quick Draw, although the skill requirements are pretty strict, and not all class skills for you...but they will be.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Class Skills (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;You pick up quite a few good skills here, making this even decent for a short dip just to pick them all up as class skills. &nbsp;This makes you nice and social for all that city slinging you&rsquo;ll be doing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Saves (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;The best thing here is the good will save, since you need a boost to it. &nbsp;Reflex is nice too, but you don&rsquo;t really need a good fort save, since you&rsquo;ll have solid con anyways.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">BAB (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Just the same that you left before, no difference here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Eye for Detai (**)l</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;You don&rsquo;t have a great int, so while this is a bonus, it&rsquo;s not amazing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Legal Judgement (***)</span><span>&nbsp;The real gem here is </span><span class="c10 c5">Justice (****)</span><span>, although it&rsquo;s not a huge boost, but it should be a nice boost to damage. &nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Quick Recovery</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;gives you healing which is pretty nice too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Danger Sense (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Now this is nice, as like stated before, initiative is a good thing to have high, as well as always being able to act in the surprise round, thus getting more use from Gunslinger&rsquo;s Initiative.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Gunmarshal (**)</span><span>&nbsp;The first bonus is meh since you got your best deeds aside from Targeting already, and the second bonus is straight flavor unless your campaign has this somewhere called [</span><span class="c5">NAME REDACTED</span><span class="c4">].</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c5">Labyrinthine Cunning (*)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Wow, this is really weird and specific. &nbsp;Hope you&rsquo;re only in cities and like controlling doors, or else this won&rsquo;t help you out at all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Urban Commando (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;This is better and a nice bonus than the last one, but still pretty down specific.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Gunhunter (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Basically Hide in Plain Sight for urban settings, not bad.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Double Jeopardy (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Now this is really nice, although sadly you can&rsquo;t get justice twice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Quarry (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;A standard action for this makes it pretty bad for use in combat, but neat outside of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c5">High Marshal (*)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Wow, this is a lame capstone. &nbsp;You don&rsquo;t need the truth, you need justice. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d probably bail from this class at 8th level to make sure you could still get Signature Deed.</span></p><p class="c0

of Porphyra</a></span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Black Powder Duelist (***)</span><span>&nbsp;For those of you who wanted to use a gunblade, here you go. &nbsp;This archetype works to make the swordcane pistol not trash, and it works. &nbsp;A melee themed archetype, it will give a bit of a samurai feel, but doesn&rsquo;t do great damage on full attacks, specializing in standard action burst.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Duelist Gunsmith (?)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Not really something to rate here, you basically need it for the archetype to work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Duelist Deeds (?)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;These basically have to be reviewed separately.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Sheathe Control (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Nothing too special here, basically free Quick Draw.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Dual Weapon (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;This actually gives a good amount of versatility in how you can attack, making close combat that much more safe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Extended Range (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;A bit more tame, but the weapon does have trash range normally.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Efficient Draw (***)</span><span class="c17">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">I&rsquo;d half say this was melee Rapid Shot, but it&rsquo;s limited to a standard action.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Wide Draw (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Even with the grit cost, the surprise factor of this and the additional damage makes it a solid option if you want to swing in melee.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Quicksilver Draw (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;For what you&rsquo;re giving up, this is a great trade, stacking even more damage on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Master&rsquo;s Draw (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;An even better version of the last deed, and a great capstone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Duelist Training (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;An even better gun training is always welcomed.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Bomb Slinger (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;This archetype basically trades out feats for bombs, and that&rsquo;s a great trade. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s a lot of thing for which bombs can be used, and with things like grit bomb, you&rsquo;ll always be ready to go.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Explosive Training (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Right away, we get bombs. &nbsp;And we lose all bonus feats. &nbsp;With alternative deeds, that isn&rsquo;t a huge hit, but it&rsquo;s still a very large loss, making this a tough decision.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Grenade Launcher (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Now being able to load a bomb into a weapon is very nice, and the trade off is quite beneficial, making this nice for long distance bombing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Artillery Specialist (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Nimble is okay, but discoveries (even bomb specific ones) are game changers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Grenade Deeds (?)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Same as with duelist deeds, these have to be looked at specifically.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Grit Bomb (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Always having a bomb handy, even a weak one, is amazing for having discoveries always available. &nbsp;Definitely worth rationing grit to keep this one active.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Fusion Detonation (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;The grit price is easily worth it to make opponents make multiple saves, and works with grit bomb to make sure it&rsquo;s always an option.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Bomb Shot (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Starting a full round attack with a bomb is a great mook clearer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Grenade Training (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Again, better gun training is the best.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Bonded Slinger (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;A cool idea, and without the rest of the 3p content it would be great, but you just need your deeds too much now that they&rsquo;re actually good. &nbsp;Definitely a fun story archetype, and it basically stacks with every other archetype, so feel free to take it if you want to talk to your gun.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Intelligent Firearm (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a blackblade, but for guns. &nbsp;While that&rsquo;s cool and flavorful, mechanically it&rsquo;s just not worth losing how many deeds you will, especially with other archetypes and alternative deeds vying for those very precious resources.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Dread Sniper (****)</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">For those wanting to snipe, this is really going to work well for you. &nbsp;The archetype boost things that snipers want to do, keeps them hidden, and makes sure their damage isn&rsquo;t terrible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Sniper Gunsmith (?)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Another weapon swap, no big deal here. &nbsp;But it does alleviate some range penalties, which is nice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c5">Deadly Sniper (*****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Better than base gun training and functions well with the sniping mechanic, this is what a sniper needs, even if the extra damage isn&rsquo;t huge.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Sniper Deeds (?)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;This comes in later than most archetypes, but let&rsquo;s check them out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Mobile Sniper (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;After sniping, it&rsquo;s easy enough to pinpoint where they are, so being able to move can keep you from being caught.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Expert Targeting (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;A straight buff to sniping, targeting is a fun deed as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Rapid Sniping (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;With how many ways you can drop this penalty, you should be able to use this often enough and it makes a great opening blitz.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Critical Sniper (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;A 2x crit isn&rsquo;t amazing, but what is great is setting off crit feats and other effects for a very easy to hit benchmark.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Hide in Plain Sight (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Pretty nice here, it helps keep you ready to snipe wherever.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Overkill (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s not a great boost, but it still keeps you rolling in the criticals.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Favored Terrain (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;By itself it isn&rsquo;t great, but with hide in plain sight, it comes together very well.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Elemental Desperado (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;For those who want to sling elements, this is a prime way to do it. &nbsp;Infusions are a nice swap for deeds, both giving plenty of options here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Elemental Shot (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;So you can shoot an energy blast now, that&rsquo;s pretty nice. &nbsp;Energy damage is generally worse than physical, but at the same time, it&rsquo;s always a touch attack, which is a nice break even.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Grit (?)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;It works like you think it would, pay grit instead of burn.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Infusion Deeds (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Any option is a good option, and you&rsquo;ll want more infusions to make this worthwhile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Infusion Specialization (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;While slow, with grit as a renewable resource, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be amazing, and you can increase your versatility quite a bit.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Gunsmoke Phantom (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;An archetype for those who enjoy mobility, the teleportation is worth the cost of admission, everything else just makes this even better, and it all comes together quite well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Gunsmoke Deeds (?)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;This archetype only alters deeds, which is pretty nice for stacking.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Smoke Step (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Teleportation, even short range, can change battles.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Haze of War (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;While not offensive, it&rsquo;s a very nice utility ability.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Smoke Shield (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s useful if you want to sling in melee, but not much elsewhere.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Sickening Haze (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Mobility plus a debuff is worth your action, even if you can&rsquo;t attack.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Smoke Assault (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;And this is where your mobility gets intense.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Deadly Haze (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;With the right deeds, this can be a very useful tactic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Choking Haze (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s like sickening haze, but a lot better and does damage.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">High Roller (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s hard to rate this, as it&rsquo;s all based on chance. &nbsp;It can be the best or worst archetype, but the thing that can be said is that the odds are always fair, and it lets you really play the risk/reward game that the gunslinger is built upon with the misfire mechanic.</span></p><p

early.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Roll the Dice (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s an all or nothing with a chance of misfire, but you can spend greed to tip the odds in your favor, making it overall worth considering if you like playing it unsafe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Let it Ride (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;If the low stakes of the last deed weren&rsquo;t good enough, why not kick it up a notch?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Hot Streak (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Being able to make more gambling shots is a fun way to spend your turn.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Loaded Dice (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;And if you don&rsquo;t want to risk it all if you really want to win big, here&rsquo;s a nice way to make sure you&rsquo;re not risking nearly as much.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">All or Nothing (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Literally what it describes, as failure jams your gun and hurts you, while success deals max damage and gives you temporary hit points. &nbsp;Probably worth it just on coolness factor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ace in the Hole

class="c13 c5">Minotaur (*****)</span><span class="c4">) Normal double crossbows are okay, but Crossbow Mastery doesn&rsquo;t make them reload as a free action. &nbsp;The minotaur doesn&rsquo;t have that special text in it, making it the highest damage free action reloadable weapon you can wield, so it&rsquo;s amazing and the best for intense damage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Crossbow, Hand (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;The distance of this and the feat needed to wield it make this slightly worse than the light crossbow, even with not having a -2 for firing it one handed. &nbsp;Cool for twf and being stylish as hell.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Crossbow, Heavy (**)</span><span>&nbsp;(</span><span class="c3">Underwater

lacking in reload speed. &nbsp;The additional damage isn&rsquo;t really worth it either, as base damage isn&rsquo;t your best friend. &nbsp;Repeating is worse due to being exotic, but Crank at least gives you some neat utility, just like underwater.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Crossbow, Launching (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;This is a rather unique weapon, and almost gives you more of an elemental bent to your attacks, as you&rsquo;re able to load it down with things like acid and alchemist fire. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re still going to need Crossbow Mastery to reload it fully and the ammo is expensive as well as not having great range, but it is making ranged touch attacks with no grit investment which is quite useful. &nbsp;The feat cost is high though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Crossbow, Light (****)</span><span>&nbsp;(</span><span class="c10 c5">Underwater (****)</span><span>/</span><span class="c8 c5">Repeating (*)</span><span>/</span><span class="c10 c5">Crank (****)</span><span class="c4">) Now this is your crossbow of choice, being able to get it down to a free action reload. &nbsp;They&rsquo;re also treated as light weapons for dual wielding which is very nice, especially if you can find a way to reload (with a Grasping Tail, maybe?), although repeating is a step down since you need two hands to reload it. &nbsp;You still take a -2 for firing it one handed though, so keep that in mind. &nbsp;Crank is nice too, really probably slightly better than regular due to the additional utility.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Gastraphetes (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;While a monster of a weapon, the -4 for standing shots isn&rsquo;t worth the increased damage die this weapon provides in most circumstances unless

(**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Shockingly this isn&rsquo;t good for CQC despite what The Boss would lead you to believe. &nbsp;No way to make this dex to damage without Agile make this only okay since you can&rsquo;t use the hand to reload as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Cestus (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;A much better dex to damage option, as it leaves the hand open to reload makes this your primary CQC weapon under most circumstances, and it looks really cool. &nbsp;It needs Agile to work, but it&rsquo;s worth it. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a decision between this and unarmed though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Others (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Just about anything else is going to be weak with the feat investment needed, stick with

rocking crazy dex.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Hamaki (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;For those of you rocking the aforementioned crazy dex, this is what you need, as there&rsquo;s no ceiling to the dex bonus you can have for this armor. &nbsp;Medium armor is right out, as you want to keep Nimble.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Buckler (****)</span><span>&nbsp;Once it&rsquo;s masterwork, you can wear it without issues and better yet stick bonuses on it to free up armor for other enchantments, since you&rsquo;re using it as an

Gun</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Thanks to the Bolt Ace, there is a strong divide in what can be done with the Gunslinger. &nbsp;Really, we have to compare Bolt Ace to Pistolero and Musket Master archetypes. &nbsp;For this, we need to see the pros and cons of crossbows and guns. &nbsp;The thing is that most of these builds are really capable of being used with both Bolt Ace and Pistolero/Musket Master, which are sadly the two most optimal archetypes.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">For some of you, the decision will be made for you by the campaign setting (No one&rsquo;s using guns in LOTR style fantasy), but these comparisons are being made for games in which the option is yours. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll admit, I personally prefer the Bolt Ace since it actually makes crossbows viable, something I never thought I&rsquo;d live to see as well as coming with more base level support due to them having been in the game longer.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">But let&rsquo;s make this nice and subjective, and see

A one-handed firearm can have up to 2 modifications, while a two-handed firearm can have up to 3 modifications. All advantages and disadvantages of a modification stack with each other, and some modifications can only be applied to certain weapons.

of equipment you can have. &nbsp;Most of the advice here is going to be for ranged weapons and such, but there&rsquo;ll also be advice for those of you looking to CQC. &nbsp;The most important thing you should be doing is finding gear to fill holes that your class leaves behind, like finding ways to increase your mobility.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c22">Magical Weapons</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Non Numerical Bonus</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">+14,000 GP </span><span class="c3">Dueling (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Only worth it on a melee weapon you know you&rsquo;ll always have in hand (gauntlet or such), it&rsquo;s a steep cost, but an initiative bonus is solid for you. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s just a matter of how fast you want to be.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">+1</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Numerical Bonuses (****)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span>(</span><span class="c5">+1, +2, +3, +4, +5</span><span class="c4">) With the amount of attacks you can put in the air, getting additional damage to each of them is pretty prime. &nbsp;Beating DR is also nice, although Clustered Shots should take care of that for you. &nbsp;Still bonus damage is always nice, as is additional accuracy, especially for Bolt Aces.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Agile (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;For CQC specialist, this drops you needing Weapon Focus and Slashing/Fencing Grace, so it&rsquo;s a solid call if you&rsquo;re looking to reduce the amount of feats you need to make this style work. &nbsp;This is honestly the only thing you should get on your offhand weapon, stick to advancing your main hand firearm or crossbow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Bane (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;This only has use in themed games, but it&rsquo;s incredible in them. &nbsp;Aligned outsiders and undead are strong picks for this, since most games eventually end up facing off against them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Distance (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Since all your guns mostly have terrible range, doubling it can save some grit and headaches.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Elemental (**)</span><span>&nbsp;(</span><span class="c5">Corrosive, Frost, Flaming, Shocking</span><span class="c4">) As stated, additional damage is nice, but the problem here is elemental resistances are common, so these are weaker than straight bonuses.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Heartseeker (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;If you don&rsquo;t have another way to get past concealment and cover, it&rsquo;s worth buying since aside from undead, this will work on most things.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Lucky (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Really the biggest bonus of this is being able to reroll possible misfires, although sadly since it&rsquo;s not a deed, you can&rsquo;t reduce it. &nbsp;Still, it&rsquo;s a bonus grit too, which is always nice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Reliable (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;You&rsquo;ll probably need this at some point, as dropping misfire is really important, especially for early firearms using alchemical cartridges. &nbsp;Great for advanced firearms with low misfire rates.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">+2</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Aligned (***)</span><span>&nbsp;(</span><span class="c5">Holy, Unholy, Axiomatic, Anarchistic</span><span class="c4">) Kind of like bane, but less specific. &nbsp;This depends on your game, but if you&rsquo;re using guns, you have a lot of other things that you may need to take first.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Designating, Lesser (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Not only great for CQC (you are your own ally), but also a great party buff to give a stacking bonus to all attack and damage rolls, making you a great team player.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c5">Elemental Burst (*)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;No, this isn&rsquo;t worth it, you could have lucky or reliable instead of this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Endless Ammunition (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Only crossbows here, and it&rsquo;s basically a way around needing Rapid Reload and Crossbow Mastery, so it&rsquo;s your call here on if money or feats matter more to you. &nbsp;Crossbows need less enchantments though, so it&rsquo;s not terrible on a minotaur double crossbow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c5">Stalking (*)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;It may be cool for a sniper, but this isn&rsquo;t worth the cost with how many other things you need.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">+3</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Lucky, Greater (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;The real bonus of Lucky was the reroll on possible misfires, but extra grit isn&rsquo;t terrible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Reliable, Greater (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Most guns need this, and it&rsquo;s fine for if you HATE misfires, since it basically removes them as a problem for you. &nbsp;Still, it&rsquo;s an expensive solution to this problem. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c5">Speed (*)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;You should really have Boots of Haste by now, this is too expensive for what you should pick up.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">+4</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Designating, Greater (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Even more designating goodness with a larger damage bonus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c5">Nimble Shot (*)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Ew, this is NOT worth a +4 bonus, it&rsquo;d barely be worth a +1 bonus.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c22">Magical Armor</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Non Numerical Bonus</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">+2,700 GP </span><span class="c10 c5">Glamoured (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Your armor should be as stylish as you, and looking harmless is very nice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">+3,750 GP </span><span class="c10 c5">Shadow (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;This is a nice cost for a huge boost in stealth, but later versions are overpriced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">+10,000 GP </span><span class="c3">Delving (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Getting an entirely new form of travel for 10k is pretty nice, but BYOO(xygen).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">+30,000 GP </span><span class="c10 c5">Determination (****)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Get this on both buckler and armor, it&rsquo;s almost a bonus life per day as long as you didn&rsquo;t take excessive damage. &nbsp;It will only save you from things that reduce your HP to 0 though.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">+1</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c5">Numerical Bonuses (****)</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span>(</span><span class="c5">+1, +2, +3, +4, +5</span><span class="c4">) Make sure to spread these between buckler and armor to keep the price down</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Brawling (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;For those of you who went monk, this is a great (untyped) bonus for super cheap.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Fortification, Light (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;For you, this matters less, and 25% isn&rsquo;t a lot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Spell Storing (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;While you don&rsquo;t have spells, it could be useful if a friend is willing to help out.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">+2</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Animated (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;The move action is kind of weak, but it&rsquo;s not terrible if you really want the AC bonus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Arrow Deflection (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Probably slightly over priced for a feat, but decent for shields if you have some cash.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c5">Spell Resistance 13 (*)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Burn this, it&rsquo;s garbage, same with all increases.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">+3</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Fortification, Moderate (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;I just don&rsquo;t feel like the increase in protection is worth it.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">+4</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Nothing here, it&rsquo;s all garbage.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">+5</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">Fortification, Heavy (**)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Sadly not at 100%, although it&rsquo;s decent protection regardless.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c22">Wondrous Items</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">AKA; how to turn yourself into a Christmas Tree. &nbsp;Each slot is important for you (...except body), and it&rsquo;s best to try and really get your money&rsquo;s worth for all magic doodads you can bolt to yourself. &nbsp;For me, lower cost items that do nice things are going to be rated higher, as you want your build to get off the ground ASAP. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s not worth hoping for great items you&rsquo;ll never see in your 1st to 4th level game.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Belt</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">1,000 GP </span><span class="c3">Beneficial Bandolier (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Man, if you&rsquo;re able to combo this with a stat belt, even for 1 and &frac12; cost, it&rsquo;d totally be worth it since this is cool. &nbsp;Not sure why it

cool concept suck so hard? &nbsp;It&rsquo;s an armor bonus, so it&rsquo;s not stacking with anything, the AC bonus against guns is meh, and bonus grit is only okay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">67,000 GP </span><span class="c3">Otherworldly Kimono (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;A nice resistance bonus and a maze effect is good.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span

class="c3">Sniper&rsquo;s Goggles (***)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;For those of you with sneak attack, these will be a great damage buff, but the greater version is probably overkill, since most

this job is how hot that gun gets after you fire it. &nbsp;Swords don&rsquo;t heat up, bows don&rsquo;t feel nothin&rsquo;, but a gun? &nbsp;You can feel that bullet live and die the second you pull the trigger, the explosion celebrating the end of a life that you never knew.&rdquo; Vyer Starisk, Hero of the Mainwall Rebellion</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Slingers are not the most complicated group since they&rsquo;re so linear in design. &nbsp;Honestly I could post one build here and call it &ldquo;</span><span class="c5">GUN</span><span class="c4">!&rdquo; to let you know how to go, but I&rsquo;m going to try to do a little more than that since there&rsquo;s a few ways we can take this. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d say there&rsquo;s two main builds, CQC and straight slinger, so I&rsquo;ll try to focus on those, although again thanks to how linear things are, this is literally just a feat rundown. &nbsp;But before that&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">The Boss CQC </span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">The biggest issue with this build is that we don&rsquo;t have a free hand to reload with and can&rsquo;t be done with crossbows, making it very difficult to CQC. &nbsp;The only way to get around this is unarmed strikes (or a cestus). &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll have to get the cestus made Agile since it doesn&rsquo;t qualify for Slashing Grace, but you can avoid needing a monk dip for this. &nbsp;Monk&rsquo;s not a bad dip though, so don&rsquo;t cry if you have to shave your head to go off like this. &nbsp;Invest in the cestus first though, you want this style to go off ASAP. &nbsp;For this build, we&rsquo;re assuming no dips. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">1st Level Feat</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Rapid Reload</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">3rd Level Feat</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Weapon Finesse</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">4th Level Feat</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Two

class="c4">To examine, we&rsquo;ve got the basics of what we need, and with the cetsus as light weapon, we&rsquo;re in a good place for TWF penalties. &nbsp;Early levels will probably be just gun or fist, since we don&rsquo;t have the best ability to use both at the same time. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ve got even more time before you start feeling like you&rsquo;re good at attacking in melee though, since we need to wait a little longer before getting Gunslinger, the last piece of this puzzle...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">7th Level Feat</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Gunslinger</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">8th Level Feat</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Point Blank Shot</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">9th Level Feat</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Rapid Shot</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">At this point, we&rsquo;re able to start focusing on damage. &nbsp;The build doesn&rsquo;t really need Precise Shot, since you&rsquo;re already in the fray, so don&rsquo;t worry about it. &nbsp;Deadly Aim and Rapid Shot can be swapped out for when you get them, since it&rsquo;s really a matter of personal preference there. &nbsp;By this point you should also have an agile cestus, giving your damage another nice spike as well.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span

Gap</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">This another stretch where we&rsquo;re just looking to improved damage. &nbsp;We&rsquo;re ignoring Snap Shot here since you already threaten, and while the improved version would be nice, burning a feat for Weapon Focus isn&rsquo;t really that good. &nbsp;All feats except for 11th are open to rearranging, since they&rsquo;re all basically just for piling on damage, as Hammer the Gap really helps make you put up a ton more reliable damage by this point.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">16th Level Feat</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Greater Two Weapon Fighting</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">17th Level Feat</span><span

Feat</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Skill Focus: Perform: Dance</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">These are all blank slate feat choices, by this level you&rsquo;ve got your concept off the ground, so it&rsquo;s more about how you want to keep piling on damage. &nbsp;With Hammer the Gap, you have a chance of hitting that third attack from GTWF, and the rest are just whatever, you&rsquo;re already a CQC expert.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Revolver Ocelot</span><span>/</span><span class="c1">Sniper Wolf</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">This will be your more generic gunner build, using only a single gun or crossbow. &nbsp;To make this into a TWF (except for crossbows) isn&rsquo;t incredibly hard, it just involves switching out some feats, and I&rsquo;ll put those next to this for my suggestions of which feats to swap out before doing so. &nbsp;Unless you have advanced two handed firearms, this will be assuming Musket Master for your archetype, but the advice is the same regardless.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">1st Level Feat</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Rapid Reload (If Musket Master, Weapon Focus)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">3rd Level Feat</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Point Blank Shot</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">4th Level Feat</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Deadly Aim (If TWF, Dazzling Display)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">5th Level Feat</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Weapon Focus (If Musket Master, Precise Shot)</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Weapon Focus is a necessary evil, since we need it for Snap Shot and Dazzling Display, making it basically required if you want to sling well. &nbsp;Rapid Reload is best to take at 1st so you smoothly curve into getting multiple attacks while Musket Masters are a feat ahead of the curve. &nbsp;Getting Dazzling Display out of the way soon is good for TWF, and hell, you might even get some use out of it. &nbsp;Musket Masters get a bonus feat here, make it whatever. &nbsp;Normally I&rsquo;d suggest Precise Shot, but you&rsquo;re firing at touch, a -4 doesn&rsquo;t hurt that much.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">7th Level Feat</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Rapid Shot (If TWF, Quick Draw)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">8th Level Feat</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Snap Shot (If TWF, Gun Twirling)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">9th Level Feat</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Precise Shot (If TWF, Two Weapon Fighting) (If Musket Master, Improved Initiative)</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">TWF takes off HARD at these levels, while everything else is just picking up Snap Shot. &nbsp;If Snap Shot isn&rsquo;t your thing, you can skip it, take Improved Initiative or Precise Shot earlier, something that makes you better at starting things, but I think Snap Shot is a nice feat to keep you from having complacent opponents. &nbsp;Bolt Aces have more reason to pick up Precise Shot though, so it and Deadly Aim should probably be switched.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">11th Level Feat</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Signature Deed</span></p><p class="c0"><span

class="c4">&nbsp;Hammer the Gap (If TWF, Hammer the Gap)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">15th Level Feat</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Clustered Shots</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Like before, these are all in optional order, TWFs may want to take Clustered Shots earlier since they&rsquo;re popping off more rounds (unless you&rsquo;re 2x barreling) but Hammer the Gap is also a huge boon to slingers who are putting tons of metal in the air. &nbsp;Again by this point you&rsquo;re basically polishing your gun since you have everything you need, but it&rsquo;s good to make sure you&rsquo;re finishing well.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">16th Level Feat</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Combat Reflexes/Improved Snap

c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Pick up whichever you didn&rsquo;t earlier, maybe improve your crit range, you&rsquo;re basically done here. &nbsp;At this point, you&rsquo;re probably maxed on damage so if you can add more attacks, do it. &nbsp;If not, make them as accurate as possible. &nbsp;Throw True Grit on whatever you want, you already put it on the most important thing at 11th level, and light a cigar with your muzzle because you&rsquo;re the new Legendary Mercenary.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span

takes advantage of the crossbow. &nbsp;For this build since you can basically use the last build for normal crossbow builds, we&rsquo;re going to make this a minotaur double crossbow

can get this style online by 3rd level with the considerably useful feats Point Blank Shot and Rapid Shot in our collection. &nbsp;Crossbow Mastery is our only &lsquo;non standard&rsquo; feat that would normally be something better. &nbsp;Until 5th level, you&rsquo;re probably using a light crossbow since taking Crossbow Mastery just for the heavy crossbow isn&rsquo;t worth the feat by itself.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">7th Level Feat</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Precise Shot</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">8th

class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">The 9th feat could be Weapon Focus, but that&rsquo;s only if you&rsquo;re going Snap Shot, which isn&rsquo;t super vital for you and your beautiful range. &nbsp;MDC users are getting more out of Hammer the Gap here with their attacks, although it&rsquo;s a little annoying to pick up Precise Shot this late. &nbsp;Still, you&rsquo;re doing well on damage and accuracy here, so really anything by this point is fine.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">11th Level Feat</span><span

course of history for all of the right reasons. &nbsp;So for that reason, I&rsquo;m going to kill you and sleep soundly knowing that I&rsquo;ve ended a reign of tyranny that this land may never

better, cestus or unarmed strike?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">A:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Okay, this is a hard one. &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s do some pros and cons here.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Unarmed strike pros</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">-Doesn&rsquo;t require a free hand (can use a 2 handed weapon and unarmed strike)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">-Always accessable (can&rsquo;t be disarmed)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">-Only requires 4k for agile amulet of mighty fist</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">-Higher base damage (1d6)</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Unarmed strike cons</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">-Lower crit range</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">-Can&rsquo;t be made of special materials</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">-Requires a feat or monk dip</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">-Amulet of mighty fist takes up amulet slot</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">-Requires contact with monsters (which can sometimes damage you)</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Cestus pros</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">-Higher crit range</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">-Able to incorporate special materials (silver, adamantine, etc)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">-Doesn&rsquo;t require amulet of mighty fist</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Cestus cons</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">-Cost 8k to get +1 agile cestus</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">-Requires free hand</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">-Able to be disarmed (unlikely)</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">If you&rsquo;re willing to dip monk (not a bad dip) I&rsquo;d probably go unarmed strike but it&rsquo;s a very even mix, so you&rsquo;re really golden either way you go.</span></p><p
