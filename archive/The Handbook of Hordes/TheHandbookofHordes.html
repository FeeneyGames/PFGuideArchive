Some start out with good intentions and are slowly pulled down the alignment scale, while others set out to be necromancers from the start. They scheme for power, striving to raise more powerful undead in greater numbers. Slowly, a necromancer ammasses a force that can challenge armies, swarm castles, and topple kingdoms. No force can stop a true necromancer since each conflict will only add to their power.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of how one becomes a necromancer or what they plan to do with their power, one thing is true of all those who raise the dead: a desire for power. &nbsp;This guide is designed to help you find such power.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many paths to becoming a necromancer, including a variety of classes, feats, and spells. &nbsp;Each necromancer must consider these options for themselves and decide how they want to achieve their goals. &nbsp;There is no &ldquo;right way&rdquo; to be a necromancer, but there are ways that are more effective at achieving specific goals. &nbsp;This guide will discuss the merits of each of these options and how they fit in to the greater whole of necromancy.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The necromancer faces many challenges. &nbsp;How do you acquire bodies to animate?

Or even worse, a Paladin? &nbsp;While these problems are inevitable, this guide will at least try to provide some options to help cope with them.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span

considering</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Orange</span><span class="c0">: Not a great option, but there are a few situations where it might be

either way I&rsquo;d avoid it.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c8 c5">Basics of Undead</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A necromancer has a few main tools to building and controlling their undead horde. &nbsp;As a necromancer you want to control as many powerful undead as you can, but if any of your undead escape your control they will go around killing indiscriminately like the monsters they are. &nbsp;So like most things in necromancy it becomes a matter of power and control.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c5">Animate Dead</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- This spell is the basis of necromancy. &nbsp;It allow you not only to raise 2HD per Caster Level of undead, but also control 4 HD per Caster Level indefinitely. &nbsp;For example at level 5 you can control 20 HD of undead and raise them 10HD at a time. &nbsp;You could have tow big creatures or a whole bunch of small creatures under your control. &nbsp;If at any point you raise more than you can control you have to release some of your undead, so keep track of it.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c7">Command Undead (feat)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- This feat allows you to use channel energy to take control of nearby undead. &nbsp;Essentially giving you an extra HD per caster level of undead to control. &nbsp;Unfortunately the undead get a will save to resist you so it&rsquo;s best used on weaker undead. &nbsp;It can be a good way to control utility undead though.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c5">Command Undead (spell)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- If you want to control an unreasonable amount of undead this is how you should do it. &nbsp;The spell targets a single undead, if it&rsquo;s mindless (like skeletons and zombies) it automatically falls under your control for a number of days equal to your caster level without a save no matter how big it is. &nbsp;This means if you are willing to spend the spell slots on it you can control hundreds of powerful undead at higher levels. &nbsp;Additionally this also allows you to control intelligent undead (although they do get a save)</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c5">Desecrate</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- This is the spell that lets you control the truly powerful undead. &nbsp;Undead created within the area have an additional HP per HD, and more importantly it increases the amount of HD you can raise with animate dead at one time. &nbsp;This means that you can animate a single very powerful creature that has HD equal to 4 times your caster level. &nbsp;If you want to ride the zombie of an adult red dragon into battle at level 6 this is how you do it.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Create Undead</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- This is serious, dangerous dark magic so it should not be approached lightly. &nbsp;The spell allows you to create intelligent undead, which can be much more powerful than most of the things you can animate normally, but are also a lot harder to control. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c8 c5">Classes</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">There are quite a few classes that can animate the dead, but to be a true necromantic powerhouse you need to be a full caster.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c7">Cleric</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- Clerics are the first class to get access to undead with Lesser Animate Dead at third level, and Animate Dead at fifth. &nbsp;They can already channel negative energy so it&rsquo;s easy for them to pick up Command Undead (feat). &nbsp;The ability to channel and cast inflict wounds spontaneously makes them good at keeping their undead moving and their support spells are very helpful for both the party and their undead. &nbsp;Their only real shortfalling is that they can&rsquo;t get access to Command Undead (spell). &nbsp;This means that they are a good choice early on, and can control a few incredibly powerful undead, but if you want a full army you may be better off elsewhere. &nbsp;There is even an Undead Lord archetype!</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c5">Oracle</span><span>&nbsp;- Oracles are probably one of the most popular choices for necromancers. &nbsp;They get access to animate dead just one level after Clerics. &nbsp;The JuJu oracle was the most popular choice because it used to have some ways to increase the amount of HD you could control, but was errated. &nbsp;Bones is probably the best mystery for necromancy now because it can allow you to take Command Undead (feat) even though you normally can&#39;t channel. &nbsp;However the real gem is the </span><span class="c5">Lich</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Curse. &nbsp;The curse makes you heal from negative energy (that&#39;s fine, you probably want that anyway) and grants Command Undead (spell) as a bonus spell. &nbsp;This is the fastest build to get all of the main necromancer tools. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c7">Shaman</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">- The Lore Spirit can get you access to Command Undead (spell) as well as other wizard spells you might want. &nbsp;With access to Command Undead (spell) and Lesser Animate Dead at third level which is lower than any other class. &nbsp;You can&#39;t get Command Undead (feat) or Desecrate easily though, which is a pain but certainly workable. </span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Sorcerer</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- Sorcerers don&#39;t get access to animate dead until 8th level, which is brutal unless you&rsquo;re starting at a high level. &nbsp;After that they aren&rsquo;t much worse than the others, but they still can&rsquo;t cast desecrate.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c7">Witch</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">- You need the Gravewalker archetype to get animate dead spells and the Hexchannel Archetype to get channel for Command Undead (feat) but with the two you end up most of the tools you need except a way to cast desecrate. &nbsp;You also get your first access to Animate dead at 6th level which is a little on the slow side. &nbsp;That said Gravewalkers do get some cool abilities to deliver touch spells at a distance, control more undead, and even possess the undead they control.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c5">Wizard</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- Are a bit slower than oracles because Lesser animate dead is a third level spell for arcane casters instead of second which means you can&#39;t actually have any undead until level 5, and you don&rsquo;t get animate dead until 7th level. &nbsp;On the bright side you get access to Command Undead (feat) through the necromancy school, and Command undead (spell) as a second level wizard spell. &nbsp;The only hard part is desecrate. &nbsp;They can take Faith Magic at 7th level to cast it once per day, or just buy a wand since you only need it when you first animate the dead. &nbsp;While they aren&rsquo;t quite as good as oracles because of the slower spell access, the ability to learn and prepare a wide variety of spells can be very useful for a necromancer. &nbsp;This is particularly true for the paranoid, army raising, types of necromancers. &nbsp;There is also the Undead Master archetype that gives a corpse companion and faster access to animate dead spells which is incredibly important if you want to play at lower levels. </span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c5">Agent of the Grave</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(Prestige class) - Charisma to HP, extra HD of undead, become a walking desecrate spell, learn spells you wouldn&rsquo;t normally have access to, and some other goodies. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s only a 5 level class and you&rsquo;d need the Prestigious Spellcaster feat, but it&rsquo;s definitely worth looking into.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c8 c5">Races and Ability Scores</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the race and ability scores are going to depend primarily on the class you choose. &nbsp;Generally it is a good idea to prioritize your casting stat and have at least decent DEX, CON, and WIS for saves.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c8 c5">Feats</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feats are also going to depend on your class, but there are definitely a few worth pointing out.<br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Blood Disciple</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- Allows you access to all the creepy scrolls you could want even if they&rsquo;re illegal. &nbsp;This could be useful in campaigns where laws like that are strict and you can&rsquo;t make your own easily.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c3 c11 c5"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c5">Charnel Soldiers</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- Allows you to give any undead you make a teamwork feat you possess for free. &nbsp;Unfortunately that means you need the teamwork feat too, and undead don&rsquo;t meet many prereqs so your choices are limited, but this can still be incredible.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bonded Mind</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- (Teamwork) Allows you to communicate (issue commands) to your undead without speaking. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c3 c5 c11"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c5">Shake it Off</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- (Teamwork) increases all your saves by +1 for each adjacent ally with the feet, up to +4. &nbsp;Animate 4 squirrels or something and get a free +4 typless bonus to all your saves.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Stealth Synergy</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- (Teamwork) Allows everyone to use the best roll when group stealthing. &nbsp;Stealth isn&rsquo;t normally how undead hordes roll, but if you want to this is how to do it.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c3 c5 c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c7">Outflank</span><span class="c21">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">- (Teamwork) Even if you only have a few undead they are probably going to do an awful lot of flanking.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c2 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Tandem Trip</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- (Teamwork) Allows you to reroll trip attempts. &nbsp;Trip is a great combat maneuver, especially when you have them surrounded by skeletons and zombies. &nbsp;That said it&rsquo;s pretty specific.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c3 c11 c5"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c5">Trade Initiative</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- &nbsp;(Teamwork) you can trade initiative with someone else who has this feat that is next to you. &nbsp;Have a handful of cheap skeleton bodyguards and enjoy your great initiative. &nbsp;That said a lot of tables just have undead minions act whenever you do in initiative, so you might want to sort out how this would work with your GM first.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c5">Command Undead</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(feat) - This is one of your main methods of commanding undead</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c5">Craft Wondrous Item </span><span class="c0">- In addition to being a generally great feat it allows you to make void sticks which can temporarily desecrate an area, and be used to make some really powerful undead. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c3 c11 c5"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c5">Extend Spell</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- Command Undead (spell) is an incredible way to control a multitude of powerful undead, and extended Command Undead is twice as good.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c3 c5 c7"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c7">Extra Channel</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- You shouldn&rsquo;t need to channel too frequently to control undead, but it might still be useful. &nbsp;Also good if you&rsquo;re a Cleric.<br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c7">Faith Magic</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- Actually an arcane discovery for wizards. &nbsp;At 7th level you can get it to cast desecrate once per day.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c7">False Focus</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- If you&rsquo;re an arcane caster you can use this to cast spells with material components worth less than 100 gp for free. &nbsp;That&#39;s 4 HD of undead for free, which really cuts the price of necrocrafts down.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10 c5">Ghost Whisperer</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- Get bonuses to talking to undead. &nbsp;Why not just control them? &nbsp;You&rsquo;re trying to rule the world, not make friends with a zombie.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c3 c11 c5"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c5">Improved Channel</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- This gives a pretty notable increase to the channel DC of your Command Undead (feat).</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c15 c5">Necromantic Affinity</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">- Heal from negative energy. &nbsp;Really simplifies things when you can heal yourself and your undead all with the same mass inflict wounds or channel energy. &nbsp;That said, it&rsquo;s not a game changer and there are a few ways to get something similar as a class feature.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c3 c5 c7"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c7">Quicken Channel</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- Nice because it allows you to immediately take control if something goes wrong, but pretty situational. &nbsp;Great for Clerics though.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Skeleton Summoner </span><span class="c0">- You can summon skeletons. Which is cool and flavorful, but they&rsquo;re usually not as good as the stuff you could normally summon anyway.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c3 c5 c7"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c7">Spell Focus Necromancy </span><span class="c0">- You don&rsquo;t necessarily do too much necromancy debuffing (although you can if you want) but increasing the DC of Command Undead is important if you want to control intelligent undead.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c7">Spell Specialization</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- Your caster level for a chosen spell counts as two higher. &nbsp;That means you can raise an extra 4 HD and control an extra 8 HD with Animate Dead. &nbsp;Also stacks with Undead master.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10 c5">Threnodic Spell</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- Generally the undead should be under your control already, but if you&#39;re really paranoid or want to Geas/Quest some intelligent undead it could be ok.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c3 c5 c7"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c5">Undead Master</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">- It can allow you to animate some larger undead if you can&rsquo;t cast desecrate, but the real beauty is that all your Command Undead (spell) castings last twice as long. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s pretty much a free extend spell (that stacks with extend spell) and can be really useful if you are trying to build a really big army.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c5 c12">Undead</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of undead you make with animate dead is one of the most important choices for a necromancer. &nbsp;While some types of undead are certainly stronger than others in most circumstances, each type of undead has its place in your horde. &nbsp;This is also a good time to point out that having a massive undead horde is very inconvenient when adventuring. &nbsp;Instead I would recommend having a few powerful undead that act as your elite personal guard, and then raising a massive army only when the plot demands it. &nbsp;You just need somewhere to keep your extra corpses in the meantime.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">Elite Undead </span><span class="c0">- These are your heavy hitters and personal bodyguards. &nbsp;Anything with impressive natural attacks and a ton of HD falls in this category. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Frostfallen (added cost of topaz or turquoise, and ice)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- Frostfallen can still use wings to fly, deal additional cold damage, get a huge bonus to Cha (and thus HP), great AC, and best of all get lifesense to sniff out your enemies. &nbsp;Downside is that they are vulnerable to fire. &nbsp;These are your top choice for big flying things.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Bloody skeleton (costs Double HD)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- They count as twice as many HD to animate, but are nearly impossible to kill. &nbsp;Anything that is just too good to risk losing becomes one of these.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Necrocraft (requires lots of lesser undead, onyx, animate dead)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- They can be gigantic titans of death with all sorts of impressive powers if you have the money and corpses to make them. &nbsp;They do require a lot of corpses (and a fair amount of money) to make though. &nbsp;These end up being a good place to dump weaker corpses instead of having a lot of little useless undead.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">Utility Undead </span><span class="c0">- These are undead that are not very good for combat, but offer some utility to the necromancer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Isitoq (requires fly/levitate, clairvoyance/locate object)</span><span>&nbsp;- A little flying eye you can look through. These make great scouts, but can be a pain to make and control. &nbsp;They require a bunch of spells to make one, and since they are intelligent undead they can resist your attempts to control them using Command Undead (feat) and Command Undead (spell). &nbsp;If you maintain control of it with animate dead though it should be ok.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Beheaded (requires airwalk/fly)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- They are creepy as hell, but not much good unless you give them a special ability. &nbsp;Belching gives them a ranged touch attack, which is rare for undead, and swarming makes them a little swarm.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">Siege Undead </span><span class="c0">- These are undead that you may not normally want to control, but are useful as part of a large invasion force.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Burning Skeleton (costs Double HD)</span><span>&nbsp;- Make great shock troops in your first wave of attack. &nbsp;Their fiery aura deals damage regardless of whether or not they would be able to hit, and when they die they explode! &nbsp;Size isn&rsquo;t too important for them so you&rsquo;re best off just going for lots of little cheap ones.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Plague zombie (requires contagion spell)</span><span>&nbsp;- Attacks from Plague zombies have a chance to infect people with zombie rot. &nbsp;Anyone who dies while infected rises as another plague zombie. &nbsp;Similar to Burning skeletons they explode when they die (which also spreads zombie rot) making them great for the first wave of attack as well. &nbsp;Since the DC of zombie rot is based on the number of HD the zombie has and larger zombies get bonus HD you want them to be as physically large as possible. &nbsp;All the little zombies they end up making are great for building Necrocrafts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Multiplying skeleton (costs Double HD)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- A multiplying skeleton breaks into two skeletons with half as many HD every time it is destroyed. &nbsp;With a large or huge size skeleton this is a cool advantage that will drive the city guard nuts, but with a gargantuan or colossal skeleton you&rsquo;re getting a serious value per HD. &nbsp; It also helps if their HD is a multiple of 4.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">Normal Undead </span><span>- These undead are your normal troops. &nbsp;Maybe not good enough to go adventuring with you, but good enough to fill out the horde.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Skeleton</span><span>&nbsp;- This is your go to for generic undead. &nbsp;It is also what you make whenever you cast Lesser Animate Dead.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Fast zombie (requires haste)</span><span>&nbsp;- This is what you cast on things that need wings to fly, but it&rsquo;s not worth the materials to make a frostfallen. &nbsp;It&#39;s also a </span><span>solid</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;choice for larger undead that you aren&rsquo;t doing something more important with.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Exoskeleton (requires vermin with exoskeleton)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- If you find something with an exoskeleton this is what it becomes.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">Useless Undead </span><span>- There really is no reason to make these</span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c5">Zombie </span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- The staggered condition is just too much of a drawback.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c8 c5">Spells</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While different classes have different spell lists there are a few staples every necromancer should try to have access to.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c5">Animate Dead</span><span>&nbsp;- This is your spell. &nbsp;Always have it ready.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c2">Appearance of Life</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- It can be useful to disguise your undead sometimes. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c7">Canopic Conversion</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- does a bunch of damage and can create a serious undead that can keep the class levels of whatever it was before it died. &nbsp;Make sure it&rsquo;ll kill the target though, it&rsquo;d be a waste of a 9th level spell if the target just takes some damage.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c3 c11 c5"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c5">Command Undead</span><span>&nbsp;(spell) - The most effective way to control undead. &nbsp;Always have it ready if you can.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c5">Control Undead</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- 5 levels higher than command undead and generally much worse. &nbsp;The only advantage is that you can use it to take control of multiple undead in the same round if you lose control for some reason.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c3 c5 c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c7">Create Undead</span><span>&nbsp;- This is dangerous because intelligent undead are much harder to control. &nbsp;However if you play it right it can be incredibly useful. &nbsp;Skeletal Champions and JuJu Zombies keep the class levels of whatever they were before. &nbsp;That means all your enemy NPCs can now turn into powerful undead minions. &nbsp;Resisting your control is usually a Will save, so controlling martial characters should be easier.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c3 c5 c10"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c5">Create Greater Undead</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span>- Shadow&rsquo;s are fun, but overall the spell isn&rsquo;t any better than Create Undead</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c5">Create Variant Mummy</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span>- The mummies you can make aren&rsquo;t great. &nbsp;Pharaonic Guardian&rsquo;s on the other hand seems so good I&rsquo;m convinced there is some sort of mistake. &nbsp;(Upon further inspection this is an error on d20psfrd.com, the spell does not allow you to make Pharaonic guardians)</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c3 c5 c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c7">Cursed Earth</span><span>&nbsp;- Anything that dies in a one mile radius comes back as an undead. &nbsp;This is the dream for an undead overlord, but not terribly practical.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c2">Daywalker</span><span>&nbsp;- Another way to hide your undead.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c3 c5 c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c5">Decompose Corpse </span><span class="c0">- Turns a corpse into a skeleton, which is not usually as necessary since skeletons can be made from corpses with flesh still on them.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c3 c11 c5"></span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c11 c5">Desecrate</span><span>&nbsp;- Undead made in the area are way better. &nbsp;Also gives buffs in combat.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c10 c5">Detect Undead</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- You should be able to keep track of where your own undead are.</span></p><p class="c4 c9 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Flesh Puppet</span><span>&nbsp;- You control a zombie that looks like it is still alive and can even talk. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s useless in combat, but great for making it look like you didn&rsquo;t just murder that guy.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c3 c5 c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Harm</span><span>&nbsp;- That&#39;s either a ton of damage, or a ton of healing for your undead. &nbsp;Good for emergencies.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c10 c5">Hide from Undead</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span><span>- Another &ldquo;I accidentally lost control of my big monsters&rdquo; spell. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c3 c5 c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c7">Infernal Healing</span><span>&nbsp;- The best way for arcane casters to heal undead. &nbsp;Plus it works on the living too.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c3 c5 c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c7">Inflict Light/Moderate/Serious/Critical Wounds</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- Undead won&rsquo;t heal themselves (well unless they&rsquo;re bloody skeletons). &nbsp;You can always get a wand of inflict light wounds too.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c7">Lesser Animate Dead</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- The only way to make undead until you get Animate Dead, after that it&rsquo;s pretty useless as you&rsquo;ll almost always want some sort of template on your undead.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c5">Planar Binding</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- Planar binding is really a whole topic in itself. &nbsp;It allows you to call and hopefully persuade an outsider to help you. &nbsp;Some outsiders have great spell like abilities that can help cast things for you. &nbsp;Other outsiders you really just conjure them so you can kill them and animate their corpses. &nbsp;As a brief note you&#39;re going to need to make a magic circle against evil before you cast this to contain the thing. &nbsp;You probably should take the time to make a calling diagram (as described in magic circle against evil) and cast Dimensional Anchor. &nbsp;Below is a brief list of notable Outsiders.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c8 c5">Lesser Planar Binding</span></p><p class="c4 c13"><span class="c5">Sarcovalt</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- Casts Lesser Animate Dead 3/day. &nbsp;So you can have it follow you around and animate things for your necrocraft. &nbsp;It can also cast contagion to help make plague zombies. &nbsp;Low Charisma too so it&rsquo;ll be easy to persuade.</span></p><p class="c4 c13"><span class="c5">Half-Fiend Minotaur</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- The Biggest thing you can call with lesser. &nbsp;Get ready to kill it and make a fast zombie.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c5 c8">Planar Binding&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4 c13"><span class="c5">Lilin</span><span>&nbsp;- Can cast Animate Dead 3/day at CL 9. &nbsp;Has a pretty damn good Charisma score though so it might be hard to convince to help you.</span></p><p class="c4 c13"><span class="c5">Glabrezu </span><span>- This guy is huge and strong as hell. &nbsp;This guy is going to be a pain to kill, but I think he&rsquo;ll make a great minion.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c3 c8 c5"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8 c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greater Planar Binding</span></p><p class="c4 c13"><span class="c5">Daemon, Thanadaemon</span><span>&nbsp;- Animate Dead 3/day at CL 15 and actually easier to bind than a Lilin.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c3 c11 c5"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c5">Raise Dead</span><span>&nbsp;- Just because you normally animate dead doesn&rsquo;t mean you shouldn&rsquo;t also raise them. &nbsp;Life, Death, and Undeath should all be under your control.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Repair Undead</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- Arcane casters can&#39;t get inflict light wounds, so they get this instead. &nbsp;They do, however, get infernal healing, making this much less appealing.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c3 c5 c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Restore Corpse</span><span>&nbsp;- Puts flesh on a skeleton, which is normally still there after you kill it. &nbsp;If you find the skeleton of a long dead dragon this is how you turn it into a frostfallen or fast zombie so it can fly once again.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c3 c5 c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c7">Resurrection</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- A better but more expensive version of raise dead. &nbsp;Not normally worth the extra money.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sentry Skull</span><span>&nbsp;- One of the first necromancy spells you can get. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s pretty much just alarm though.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c7">Temporary Resurrection</span><span>&nbsp;- This is the best an arcane caster can do short of wish to bring someone back. &nbsp;Pair it with contingency and bring yourself back to life when you die and teleport yourself to a cleric.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c3 c5 c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c7">True Resurrection</span><span>&nbsp;- A much more expensive version of raise dead, but damn does it have style.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c3 c10 c5"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c5">Umbral Infusion</span><span>&nbsp;- Makes your undead stronger but harder to control. &nbsp;Control is everything to a necromancer. &nbsp;If you want stronger undead go kill something bigger.</span></p><p class="c4 c6 c13"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c8 c5">Gear</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c7">Bag of Holding</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- For all the skeletons in your closet</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Belt of&hellip;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- You really don&rsquo;t have to worry too much about your physical stats</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Cauldron of the Dead</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- if you have a ton of bodies you want to turn into zombies (maybe someone conquered a city recently?) this isn&rsquo;t a bad option. &nbsp;Only worth it if there are tons though.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c11 c5">Cloak of Resistance</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- Always good</span></p><p class="c4"><span><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c11 c5">Headband of&hellip;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- Whatever your casting stat is, it better be good</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c3 c5 c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c7">Necromancer&#39;s Athame</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- If a wizard uses this as their bonded object they can spontaneously convert necromancy spells into other necromancy spells.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c7">Phylactery of negative channeling</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- If you use channel energy for anything other than Command Undead (feat) this is a huge boost.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c7">Ring of Protection</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- deflection bonuses are the best way to add to AC, but hopefully you&rsquo;re undead should be soaking up the hits for you.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c5">Ring of Wizardry II </span><span class="c0">- There are a lot of good spells at second level and you are going to want to be able to prepare some of those as well as a tone of Command Undead (spell) if you go into controlling intelligent undead, or big armies.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c5">Robe of Bones </span><span class="c0">- I probably would yank all the undead from it immediately and ditch the robe. &nbsp;Excellent way to get a bunch of undead for not too much money.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c5">Stone, Canopic</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- allows you to summon a Vilkacis, which is pretty cool, but they&rsquo;re a hurricane of death you have to try and direct. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s a solid chance it will try to possess or kill one of your party members. &nbsp;Might be fun sometimes, but not necessarily worth the gold.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c5">Voidstick</span><span>&nbsp;- This things is worth the feat by itself. &nbsp;Whenever you stick it in the ground the surrounding area is under the effects of desecrate, and you can use them to create &ldquo;Voidstick Zombies&rdquo; which are damn powerful. &nbsp;</span></p></body></html>
