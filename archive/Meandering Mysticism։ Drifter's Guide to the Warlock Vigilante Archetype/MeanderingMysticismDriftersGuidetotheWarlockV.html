Introduction</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c8">Hello, and welcome to this first foray into making a guide for Pathfinder material! I greatly enjoy reading guides other players have made, as I have a terrible habit of making far more characters than I will ever get to actually play. As an enormous sucker for the Vigilante, seeing the Warlock got my hopes soaring high for an &ldquo;all-day&rdquo; blaster. I was let down rather abruptly upon realizing th</span><span class="c8">at Mystic Bolts are just flat out </span><span class="c8 c13">BAD</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;if you treat them as your main focus</span><span class="c8">. This, combined with sharing the same name as a class from various D&amp;D editions (despite sharing almost no similarities) put the Vigilante&rsquo;s Warlock archetype in a rough spot, teetering on the edge of &ldquo;worthless archetypes&rdquo; like so many others. The archetype isn&rsquo;t unsalvageable (like that </span><span class="c8 c13">other</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;class we dare not speak the </span><span class="c8">name</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;of practically is), though! Well, it&rsquo;s still mediocre if you&rsquo;re sticking solely to first-party material, but even then it&rsquo;s at least doable! You have spells! I make no claims to be any kind of expert, I can&rsquo;t cover everything, and you&rsquo;re going to find that I&rsquo;m writing partially off my own opinions, but hopefully I can provide an ample overview and help you squeeze out as much as the class has to offer you!</span></p><p class="c19 c16"><span class="c8 c23 c21 c25"></span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c8 c23 c21 c30">Just a warning, if you want advice for the organized play of Pathfinder Society, I&rsquo;m sad to say I&rsquo;m not at all a fan of PFS or the majority of its rulings and won&rsquo;t be putting any effort towards keeping this guide PFS-friendly. Take that as you will.</span></p><p class="c19 c16"><span class="c8 c25 c23 c21"></span></p><p class="c19 c16"><span class="c2"></span></p><a id="id.ldyf9wbf00cb"></a><p class="c19"><span class="c18 c10 c23 c21">Rating System</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">Note</span><span class="c2">: Due to just the sheer volume of options for every section, I can&rsquo;t reasonably cover everything, but I will do my best to cover everything that I feel would be worth keeping note of. If you feel like something is missing, feel free to tell me!</span></p><p class="c1 c16"><span class="c17 c10 c21"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">Black (?)</span><span class="c2">: This option, for one reason or another, cannot be rated. What a mystery!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">Red (*)</span><span class="c2">: This option is just really bad, or even intentionally hurts. Just don&rsquo;t!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c20">Orange (**)</span><span class="c2">: A sub-par option, you might find use in some specific cases, or for flavor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Green (***)</span><span class="c8">: Good, solid options, you can&rsquo;t</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;go wrong here!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Blue (****)</span><span class="c2">: Amazing options! It&rsquo;s not always perfect, but it&rsquo;s always good!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Purple (*****)</span><span class="c2">: A class defining option. You want this. You NEED this.</span></p><p class="c1 c16"><span class="c29 c8 c23 c21"></span></p><a id="id.1ui5iothngq9"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c18 c10 c23 c21">2. Class features</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">HD and BaB</span><span class="c2">: You get a d8 and 3/4th Bab progression, which is pretty average. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Saves</span><span class="c2">: Your only bad save is Fortitude, which is unFORTunate, but not the end of the world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Skills</span><span class="c2">: Holy moly, even losing perception as a class skill, you&rsquo;ve just got SO MANY class skills. You&rsquo;re also an Int-based class with 4+Int skill points per level. You&rsquo;re no skill monkey, but you&rsquo;ll still be swimming in them!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Proficiencies</span><span class="c2">: You get to cast in light armor, drop medium armor proficiency, and have the normal vigilante weapon proficiencies. I&rsquo;m not gonna complain, but it feels odd that you kept martial weapon proficiency.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Spells</span><span class="c8">: 6th level prepared spellcasting with a spellbook, using all 6th level and </span><span class="c8">lower</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;spells off the Wizard/Sorcerer list. You&rsquo;re trading half of your talents for this, and it&rsquo;s a good trade. I might be overrating 6th level casting, but this alone keeps a warlock treading water. It&rsquo;s unfortunate you don&rsquo;t get any spell discounts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c20">Dual Identity and Seamless Guise</span><span class="c8">: It&rsquo;s okay, and can give you some fun dynamics if your campaign allows it, but some GMs get huffy about it. For most cases, you could almost totally ignore it and the class would work just fine. If your GM tries to pull something dumb, like &ldquo;oh, it&rsquo;s not an intrigue campaign so you ignoring dual identity means you don&rsquo;t get social talents&rdquo;, just slap him with a book. Yes, someone&rsquo;s GM </span><span class="c8 c13">actually tried to pull that</span><span class="c2">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Social Talents</span><span class="c2">: These vary from &ldquo;amazing boosts&rdquo; to &ldquo;only good if your GM is on board&rdquo;. Even ignoring dual identity you&rsquo;ll have plenty of options.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Vigilante Talents</span><span class="c2">: Oof, as a Warlock, you get punched in the gut here, as you lose half of your talents. You have so many good talents to pick from, but you get so few! You get some really nice unique talents, as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Mystic Bolts</span><span class="c10 c20">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">(with 3pp)</span><span class="c8">: You get to pick from fire, cold, electricity, and acid initially, and get to use another energy type every six levels. It&rsquo;s 1d6 damage plus 1/4th your level, you can use it in melee and at range with a hardlocked 30 ft range, and you&rsquo;re always considered armed. You are EXTREMELY limited in what ways you can boost the power </span><span class="c8">of this ability, and despite ignoring DR, are completely screwed over by elemental resistances. It&rsquo;s a handy to have if you&rsquo;re worried about losing your weapons</span><span class="c2">, and a fantastic weapon for early on, but it quickly falls behind once enhanced composite longbows and such start coming into play.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Piercing Bolts</span><span class="c2">: This is a REALLY good ability, even if it doesn&rsquo;t totally save Mystic Bolts. At 3rd level, a single bolt per turn can be designated as hitting touch AC. At 5th level, every attack you make with Mystic Bolts is a touch attack. While your damage won&rsquo;t be anything to write home about, it will be consistent! Your touch attack Mystic Bolts won&rsquo;t work with Power Attack and Deadly Aim, but the wording sort of implied that didn&rsquo;t work even before they became touch attacks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c20">Startling, Frightening, Stunning Appearance</span><span class="c8">: I don&rsquo;t like these three features very much, even on a regular vigilante. I&rsquo;m being a bit unfair, since you can trigger them quite easily with spells, but they don&rsquo;t feel like they fit the warlock. The DC to save against them being based on your dump stat really doesn&rsquo;t help their case.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Vengeance Strike</span><span class="c8">: It&rsquo;s a boring but functional capstone, at least for the Warlock. Each of the three bonuses can be really nice, and if you want to pop out of invisibility with a bang, get your party to wait so you can study a target. Opening a fight with a guaranteed minimum dice roll of 3-5 likely means </span><span class="c10">never</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;missing that shot, and a +9d6-12d6 to a single hit is cool opening move.</span></p><p class="c1 c16"><span class="c29 c8 c23 c21"></span></p><a id="id.ym5ph3pwjxuz"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c18 c10 c23 c21">Roles</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">As a warlock, you&rsquo;re&hellip; Well, you&rsquo;re in a really weird spot. Nothing you can do is something another class couldn&rsquo;t normally do better.</span></p><p class="c1 c16"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Ranged Attacker </span><span class="c9">(with 3pp)</span><span class="c2">: Due to the 30 ft range restriction on Mystic Bolts, you&rsquo;re about on the level of someone using throwing weapons, and need the same feats. Thrown weapons is probably the most obnoxiously overtaxed combat style, but at least you don&rsquo;t have to worry about quickdraw! Your pitiful damage scaling and inability to get through resistances with Mystic Bolts means you&rsquo;re also going to be putting out less damage than even a basic archer. At least at later levels you can try to vary up your energy types if you know an enemy has no resistances to a particular element, but it&rsquo;s really easy for you to get screwed over.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c20">Melee skirmisher </span><span class="c5">(with 3pp)</span><span class="c8">: Mystic Bolts </span><span class="c12 c8"><a class="c15" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://paizo.com/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1h8%23v5748eaic9uko&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117583187000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0vNf1XDWhphuoWttnJa_Mm">don&rsquo;t add your Str Modifier to damage</a></span><span class="c2">&nbsp;when used as a melee attack, and you don&rsquo;t have many ways to make Mystic Bolts worthwhile as anything but a short-ranged cantrip. If you use a real weapon, you might be able to skate by, but you&rsquo;re going to be bad at it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Utility caster</span><span class="c2">: You&rsquo;re not going to be as good at it as a full caster, but with the sorcerer/wizard spell list you&rsquo;re still able to keep plenty of useful spells handy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Item crafter</span><span class="c2">: As a 6th level caster, you&rsquo;re not going to be the best, but being Int-based means you can certainly do it if you somehow have feats to spare.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Skill monkey</span><span class="c2">: You have a massive list of class skills. That said, you&rsquo;re not going to be particularly good at skills in general compared to other classes, or even a base vigilante.</span></p><p class="c1 c16"><span class="c8 c23 c21 c29"></span></p><a id="id.jxalqrhiww4j"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c18 c10 c23 c21">Skills</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">As mentioned in the class features section, you have a LOT of class skills. You&rsquo;re down to 4+Int from 6+Int and drop some skills (losing perception? Ouch!), but you&rsquo;re intelligence based, so you&rsquo;re going to end up with more skill points than a base vigilante. Due to just HOW MANY skills there are to talk about, I&rsquo;m going to consolidate some of them together. A fair warning that </span><span class="c10">YOUR MILEAGE MAY VARY</span><span class="c8">.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Skills depend on your GM to make them relevant! As such, while for the most part something like Appraise or Heal are absolutely awful in most groups, maybe your GM has made them invaluable skills to have and altered it so that magic doesn&rsquo;t make them totally irrelevant.</span></p><p class="c1 c16"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Class Skills</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Spellcraft</span><span class="c2">: As a spellcaster, shame on you if you don&rsquo;t put points into this. You&rsquo;ll need it to manage your spellbook and identify magical objects.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Knowledge (Arcana)</span><span class="c2">: This covers so many monsters it&rsquo;s actually kind of ridiculous. Considering you&rsquo;re an arcane caster, it&rsquo;s probably also a good idea to know about what you&rsquo;re doing too, don&rsquo;tcha think?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Knowledge (Dungeoneering)</span><span class="c8">: The main target here is identifying Aberrations, though if your DM was a fan of </span><span class="c8">Dragonquest</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;you might get some mileage out of the ability to identify oozes. Unless you&rsquo;ve got a lot of aberrations or spend a lot of time in dungeons (hello, Shattered Star) you&rsquo;re not gonna get much from this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Knowledge (Local)</span><span class="c8">: Adventurers don&rsquo;t tend to </span><span class="c8">need to know a whole hell of a lot about villages besides &ldquo;where&rsquo;s the tavern&rdquo; and &ldquo;who has the dangerous jobs&rdquo;. There is, however, great value in being able to identify humanoids! The possible flavor text is always fun.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c20">Knowledge (Nobility)</span><span class="c8">: An even more narrow version of Local, unless you&rsquo;re in an intrigue heavy game that deals with nobility, just pass. </span><span class="c10 c13">Note</span><span class="c8 c13">: Even though the SRD doesn&rsquo;t list this as a class skill, </span><span class="c12 c8 c13"><a class="c15" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://paizo.com/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1h8%23v5748eaic9ukr&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117583190000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1a5s9TgZ-vCC1JbR7zYsz5">an FAQ</a></span><span class="c17 c8 c13">&nbsp;specified that it SHOULD be one.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">Appraise</span><span class="c8 c28">:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Knock knock. Who&rsquo;s that? Oh shit, it&rsquo;s detect magic, here to take all of the appraise skill&rsquo;s stuff. I suppose depending on your GM you could bump this up a little, </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c20">Swim and Climb</span><span class="c2">: These are both Strength based, and often highly situational. A point in climb will probably at least cover early levels, but it isn&rsquo;t a mandatory thing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Acrobatics, Escape Artist, </span><span class="c10 c20">Stealth </span><span class="c10">and </span><span class="c10 c20">Ride</span><span class="c2">: Haha, cute, skills for stuff you can either do/cover with, spell slots. They&rsquo;re all Dex-based, so if you do have the spare skill points and don&rsquo;t want to rely entirely on your spellbook, you&rsquo;re not going to be wasting points for the most part. The DC&rsquo;s for Escape Artist are all pretty high, so that one in particular will require plenty of investment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Bluff</span><span class="c10">, </span><span class="c5">Disguise</span><span class="c10">, </span><span class="c5">Diplomacy</span><span class="c10">, and </span><span class="c10 c20">Intim</span><span class="c5">idate</span><span class="c2">: The whole social suite for the Vigilante, these all have potential uses to keep your identity or maneuver social situations&hellip; But since you&rsquo;re likely going to have mediocre to bad Cha, and only ever have one social trait open for swaps, you might be better off passing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Use Magic Device</span><span class="c2">: One of the most powerful skills in pathfinder, and by now you probably know the drill. You can take a trait to make it key off your Int mod, but you also probably have most of the spells you&rsquo;d want to use on your spell list.</span></p><p class="c1 c16"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Off-Class Skills</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Perception</span><span class="c2">: You lost this as a class skill, but it is the most-rolled skill in the game. At least, that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s been for all the games I&rsquo;ve seen. You&rsquo;re not going to be the best at it, but it&rsquo;s worth taking a trait to get it back, and worth putting ranks into it regardless.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Fly</span><span class="c8">: There aren&rsquo;t a lot of ways to get this as a class skill without dipping into another class, which is really unfortunate. That said, since you want high Dex anyway, you can still work it in, and probably won&rsquo;t be needing a particularly high bonus. </span><span class="c10">Note</span><span class="c2">: There&rsquo;s a rule tucked away that getting a permanent fly speed will make Fly a class skill automatically.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">Heal</span><span class="c2">: I don&rsquo;t want to rate it red, since it&rsquo;s&hellip; I think it can do SOMETHING, but it&rsquo;s not a class skill, you&rsquo;re not going to have good wisdom, and&hellip; Well, everything it can do can just be done via magic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Knowledge (Nature)</span><span class="c2">: Animals are usually pretty common enemies at low levels, and if you&rsquo;re fighting fey a lot you&rsquo;ll want to know about them! Don&rsquo;t feel bad about leaving it to an alchemist or ranger buddy though.</span></p><p class="c1 c16"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c16"><span class="c29 c8 c23 c21"></span></p><a id="id.gtptqvnlf1ru"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c18 c10">3. Ability Scores</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">Stre</span><span class="c5">ngth</span><span class="c2">: Like so many other casters, you don&rsquo;t really have much use for strength. If you&rsquo;re going to try to focus on your mystic bolts and spellcasting, feel free to dump away. If you want to use a real weapon (cough, longbow, cough) at all, you shouldn&rsquo;t dump this though.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Dexterity</span><span class="c8">: There&rsquo;s no way around it, you </span><span class="c8">are effectively a</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;dexterity based class. Your Mystic Bolts are ranged attacks, and you can only wear light armor, so you&rsquo;ll want this pretty high.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Constitution</span><span class="c2">: There is NO PC who doesn&rsquo;t want a good CON score. Unless you somehow don&rsquo;t even have a CON score, you want at LEAST a 12 post-racials.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Intelligence</span><span class="c2">: This is your casting stat. You don&rsquo;t really need to pump this to maximum since you&rsquo;re a 6th level caster, but you&rsquo;ll want to shoot for a 16 base at least.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c20">Wisdom</span><span class="c2">: Everyone benefits from Wisdom, but you don&rsquo;t particularly need to invest in it. 10-12 should probably be good enough in most cases.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">Cha</span><span class="c10 c20">ris</span><span class="c5">ma</span><span class="c8">: You really don&rsquo;t need this and can safely dump away. Some of your class features, however, are based on your Charisma, so if </span><span class="c8">you want</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;any mileage out of those you&rsquo;ll have to think twice.</span></p><p class="c1 c16"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c27 c10">Example Arrays before Racial Modifiers</span><span class="c2">:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">10 Point Buy (</span><span class="c7">abandon ship</span><span class="c2">): Str: 7; Dex: 14; Con: 13; Int: 16; Wis: 10; Cha: 7</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">15 Point Buy (</span><span class="c10 c20">Ehhhh</span><span class="c2">): Str: 7; Dex: 16; Con: 13; Int: 16; Wis: 10; Cha: 7</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">20 Point Buy: Str: 9; Dex: 16; Con: 14; Int: 16; Wis: 10; Cha: 7</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">25 Point Buy: Str: 10; Dex: 16; Con: 14; Int: 16; Wis: 12; Cha: 8</span></p><p class="c1 c16"><span class="c29 c8 c23 c21"></span></p><a id="id.jn3i9x7wh2tk"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c18 c10 c23 c21">Races</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">If I missed a race, rule of thumb is that any</span><span class="c8">thing that gives a penalty to Int (or Dex) is probably </span><span class="c7">Red</span><span class="c8">, anything that gives a bonus to one of those is usually </span><span class="c10 c20">Yellow</span><span class="c10">-</span><span class="c5">Green</span><span class="c8">, and anything with a +Dex/Int bonus is usually </span><span class="c9">Blue</span><span class="c2">.</span></p><p class="c1 c16"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Core</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Human</span><span class="c2">: As with almost every class, humans are excellent at being warlocks. The Bonus Feat is good, because you&rsquo;re going to want as many as you can get, as early as possible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Elf</span><span class="c2">: As someone who clings tightly to giving every character 14 Con, the penalty to it really hurts my soul. That said, Warlocks LOVE both Dex and Int, so you&rsquo;re still coming out ahead. There&rsquo;s a few good alternate racial traits as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Half-Elf</span><span class="c8">: Good ol&rsquo; </span><span class="c8">halfbreeds</span><span class="c2">. They&rsquo;re nothing too exciting, but you have a lot of cool racial options. Dual-minded is always an awesome choice, but popping a Skill Focus into Linguistics could mean an easy Orator.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Half-Orc</span><span class="c2">: As with half-elves, nothing exciting, but you can&rsquo;t really go wrong with them. The alternative racial trait for a luck bonus to saves, coupled with fate&rsquo;s favored, nudges them slightly above half-elves, since it nets a +2 to all saves.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Halfling</span><span class="c2">: And here comes the first of many +Dex/Cha races. Halflings are an interesting lot, and there&rsquo;s a lot going for them. With an ART for a 30 ft land speed and a +1 to all saves, they&rsquo;re at least decent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c20">Gnome</span><span class="c2">: Small size with a penalty to strength, but +Con/Cha and nothing in particular to make them stand out. They&rsquo;re not the worst choice since they&rsquo;re a small race, but they&rsquo;re also not a very good one.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c20">Dwarf</span><span class="c8">: I really don&rsquo;t know what to think here. Con and Wis are good for pretty much everyone, and the penalty to Cha is negligible&hellip; &nbsp;But there just isn&rsquo;t anything to draw dwarves to being warlocks, even with the ARTs.</span></p><p class="c1 c16"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Other Races</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Android</span><span class="c2">: +Dex/Int with a Cha penalty, as well as a couple alright resistances and immunities. Not being able to benefit from morale bonuses sucks, but you&rsquo;re still in a really good spot.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Tiefling</span><span class="c8">: </span><span class="c8">As is appropriate, tieflings make </span><span class="c8">AMAZING warlocks. W</span><span class="c8">ith a good array of alternate traits (prehensile tail is always useful, no matter what class you are) and even the ability to be small-sized, you can only go wrong in the character fluff department here. You can be a tiefling warlock, but don&rsquo;t be &ldquo;that guy with the tiefling warlock&rdquo; character. </span><span class="c8 c13">Nobody</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;likes him. You know what you did, Jim.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Aasimar</span><span class="c8">: On the other side of the proverbial coin to tieflings on outsider heritages, the celestial Aasimar are&hellip; Okay, I guess? You don&rsquo;t have a penalty stat, and if you pick up one of the alternate heritages</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">(</span><span class="c5">Garuda</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;or </span><span class="c5">Peri</span><span class="c2">, namely) you could get a bonus to Dex or Int.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">Orc</span><span class="c2">: A penalty to all mental scores is bad, enough said. Nothing&rsquo;s stopping you from trying it anyway, but Greg the Orc is gonna have a bad time when he reaches for his spellbook.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Kits</span><span class="c9">une</span><span class="c8">: I&rsquo;m not a huge fan of Paizo&rsquo;s interpretation of kitsune, as an aside. I have been warming up bit by bit. Mechanically, the +Dex/Cha is passable as usual, and they have some really cool racial feats, which likely won&rsquo;t matter until very late game. </span><span class="c10">Note</span><span class="c8">: As of Blood of the Beast, Kitsune can swap out the +Cha for +Int, can get either the Fox Shape feat or </span><span class="c8 c13">additional skill point per level</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;in place of Kitsune Magic. That&rsquo;s pretty darn nice. They&rsquo;ve got some nice 3pp support as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Tengu</span><span class="c8">: Oh boy, another weeb race, surely they must also have a bunch of cool things like kitsune? Hah, no. It&rsquo;s +Dex/Wis with a Con penalty and a few passable traits, and they have awful racial feats compared to their vulpine friends. </span><span class="c10">Note</span><span class="c2">: DSP&rsquo;s Bloodforge Infusions introduces a small-sized, -Str, +Dex/Int variation of Tengu. The book is still merely in playtesting, though.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Goblin</span><span class="c8">: I HATE, no, LOATHE Golarian goblins, in both lore and design. Unfortunately, these annoying little things have a hefty +4 to Dexterity to go with small size and 30 ft speed, a decent selection of ARTs, and </span><span class="c8 c13">no intelligence penalty for some reason</span><span class="c2">. If you have some way to justify your goblin toting around a spellbook, go ahead.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">Kobold</span><span class="c2">: Kobolds don&rsquo;t deserve to be worse than goblins, but at least these little lizards are canonically allowed to read and write. Goblins skate by with a big old boost to Dexterity, but Kobolds get punished harder and compensated less. Honestly, if I were a GM, I&rsquo;d just let them use Ratfolk or Halfling ability score modifiers instead, but that falls in the realm of houserules.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c20">Catfolk</span><span class="c2">: A penalty to Wis ALWAYS hurts, for any class barring maybe a Paladin. Other than that, another barely passable Dex/Cha race. One of the ART&rsquo;s is a racial climb speed that could come in handy early on, but aside from that they&rsquo;ve just got nothing worth writing home about.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c20">Changeling</span><span class="c8">: I&rsquo;m not a fan of pathfinder&rsquo;s changelings, but these hag-born don&rsquo;t look too hot with with that Con penalty and bonuses going to Wis/Cha. With the Witchborn alternate trait, you get Int instead of Wis, possibly bumping them up to a low </span><span class="c5">Green</span><span class="c8">. It&rsquo;s a shame Mystic Bolts isn&rsquo;t considered a spell with the fire descriptor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c20">Dhampir</span><span class="c8">: Oh look, a +Dex/Cha race with a Con penalty, wonderful. Alternate heritages could net you better scores, but negative energy affinity is irritating to deal with. </span><span class="c9">Vatela-born</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;are +Dex/Int with a Wis penalty, but they have a nasty weakness that you might not be able to trade away depending on how your GM rules the ARTs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Merfolk</span><span class="c8">: Jinkies merfolk, why did papa paizo let you have a +2 in </span><span class="c8 c13">THREE</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;stats? They don&rsquo;t have an Int bonus, but they also don&rsquo;t have any penalties. Getting stuck with an abysmal land speed by default sucks, but taking the Strongtail can patch that until you get flight. Have fun trying to justify being away from water, though!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Sylph</span><span class="c2">: Falling under the &ldquo;humans with a funny hat&rdquo; umbrella, Sylphs are actually pretty nice. They have the same ability score modifiers as elves, but are outsiders with darkvision, and a nice selection of alternate racial traits.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Ratfolk</span><span class="c2">: Small-sized? Check. +Dex/Int? Check. Penalty to a stat we don&rsquo;t need? Check! Built-in Darkvision and a racial bonus to Perception and UMD? Be still my beating heart. Only having a 20 ft land speed is lame, plus you&rsquo;re playing a big bipedal rat, but you can&rsquo;t be perfect in every way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wyrwood</span><span class="c2">: Beep boop you are a small-sized construct that is easily refluffed, with 30 ft land speed, a penalty to charisma, and a boost to Dex/Int. Goodbye Constitution score, goodbye standard healing, hello immunity to damn near everything. If your group starts games at level 3-4 or so, there&rsquo;s really no mechanical downsides here (Make Whole is on your spell list!), but I really doubt very many GMs will just let you play the race without any nerfs. (The Emotional ART should really be considered a mandatory power down.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">Skin</span><span class="c5">wal</span><span class="c9">ker</span><span class="c8">: Wow, look at those colors. The base skinwalker&rsquo;s Int penalty is absolutely crippling, but with variant heritages you can bump up, with werebat and wererat as standouts. The bestial features can be good, with stuff like scent, darkvision, or a climb speed. Werebats can even feat into a (kind of terrible) flight speed!</span></p><p class="c1 c16"><span class="c2"></span></p><a id="id.vd1t5zolx4x4"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c18 c10 c23 c21">4. 3PP Content, The Warlock, and You</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">Feel free to skip this section if you only want first-party content!</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;just know to skip over things labeled (3pp), and that most ratings will assume you are not using that content!</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Also worth noting is that I am not a writer for any of the 3pp publishers that appear in this guide.

Depending on how far your GM takes this, it winds up with a few dopey interactions (Intelligence-based companion to the lonely?) with stuff, but it&rsquo;s pretty much a feat/talent tax to get the warlock running.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Charismatic Caster</span><span class="c8">: This feat totally changes the warlock&rsquo;s focus. You turn into a Cha-based Spontaneous caster, using the same spell list as normal but gaining the spells-known of a bard. </span><span class="c9">Charisma</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;becomes a blue ability score, features based on charisma go up in rating a little, and </span><span class="c10">most +Cha races jump from </span><span class="c10">orange</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;or green to </span><span class="c9">Blue</span><span class="c2">. I dare say halflings go all the way to purple. Charisma is a weaker ability than Intelligence, as is spontaneous casting, but it&rsquo;s a fun, different way to play.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mystic Accuracy</span><span class="c8">: And </span><span class="c8">here we are, the last major patch for the Warlock&rsquo;s Mystic Bolts. You can now benefit from </span><span class="c10 c20">Power Attack</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;(or </span><span class="c5">Piranha Strike</span><span class="c8">) and </span><span class="c9">Deadly Aim</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;with Mystic Bolts, even while making touch attacks. </span><span class="c0">Clustered Shots</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;also becomes essential, letting you add your bolts together before reducing the damage from resistances. You FINALLY get proper damage scaling now! With just the feat, it&rsquo;s half of your Int modifier to damage, but it jumps to the full modifier with Genius Vigilante. With Charismatic Caster, it is instead your full Charisma modifier!</span></p><p class="c1 c16"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c16"><span class="c2"></span></p><a id="id.qh71aj9o73jo"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c18 c10 c23 c21">Archetype Stacking</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">There are things that stack with the Warlock?

I can already hear the torches and pitchforks. &ldquo;But Drifter, what&rsquo;s the point of a vigilante without dual identity!?&rdquo;, well good reader, the point is that it&rsquo;s a gimmick not everyone wants, and this unshackles the Warlock, and the vigilante&rsquo;s mechanics as a whole, from their dual identity. </span><span class="c8 c13">Stacks with: Inquisitive Detective, Focused Hunter</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Focused Hunter</span><span class="c8">: If you tend to have a lot of the same kinds of terrain in your campaign, and you don&rsquo;t like trying to set up ambushes to use the appearance features, then here&rsquo;s the archetype for you.

It&rsquo;s still a niche set of abilities, but it&rsquo;s about as good as the appearance . </span><span class="c17 c8 c13">Stacks with: Consumed Vigilante OR Exposed Vigilante, and Inquisitive Detective</span></p><p class="c1 c16"><span class="c17 c8 c13"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12 c8 c13"><a class="c15" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/197617/Legendary-Villains-Vigilantes?affiliate_id%3D277724&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117583205000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2L0R3YOYRWSlE3OkIrQFrp">Legendary Villains: Vigilantes</a></span><span class="c17 c8 c13">&nbsp;by Legendary Games</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Consumed Vigilante</span><span class="c8">: On the flipside from Exposed just dropping dual identity entirely, this is instead becoming consumed by your vigilante identity! You lost ALL social talents and may NEVER get any through any means. Instead of having two identities, you get the nameless one feat and +1 hp per level. There&rsquo;s also a ton of other cool boosts, such</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;as improved will saves, automatic renown, and more, but losing that first social talent is a real bummer for the warlock, since you could have gotten Genius Vigilante or Charismatic Caster with your first one, but being Human can soften the blow. </span><span class="c17 c8 c13">Stacks with: Focused Hunter</span></p><p class="c1 c16"><span class="c17 c8 c13"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12 c8 c13"><a class="c15" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/203792/Intrigue-Archetypes?manufacturers_id%3D3730&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117583206000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3MjePWPsG3YLMAPbw_30BR">Intrigue Archetypes</a></span><span class="c17 c8 c13">&nbsp;from Legendary Games</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Inquisitive Detective</span><span class="c8">: This is a neat little archetype. You trade a few social talents and gain the inspiration pool of an investigator, and can your remaining social talents for investigator talents. You use your Cha mod instead of Int for all things related to inspiration, but Genius Vigilante winds up flipping that right back to Int, letting you be the scholarly mage you&rsquo;ve always wanted to be! The old playtest version had you losing your first level social talent, but the current version instead starts at 3rd level. &nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c13">Stacks with: Exposed Vigilante, Focused Hunter</span></p><p class="c1 c16"><span class="c2"></span></p><a id="id.8ruhnftsodc3"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c18 c10 c23 c21">5. Traits</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Oh BOY are there a lot of traits to try and cover. Seriously. I tried to keep it to only the relevant ones and there&rsquo;s still just so many of them. I suggest going to check out a guide on nothing but traits if you want to know about more of them. I won&rsquo;t touch campaign traits, since those will likely only come up if you happen to be playing that campaign.</span></p><p class="c1 c16"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Combat</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Reactionary</span><span class="c8">: Probably the most common, stock standard trait for every single class out there. A PC getting beaten up as a child is pretty common for whatever reason. It&rsquo;s a +2 trait bonus to initiativ</span><span class="c2">e, no strings attached. Does ANYONE need to have an explanation for why this is good?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Resilient</span><span class="c2">: A +1 trait bonus on Fortitude saves. It&rsquo;s not fantastic, but if you&rsquo;re worried about it it&rsquo;s a nice patch. It competes with reactionary, though, which would let you possibly avoid even needing to take the save at all.</span></p><p class="c1 c16"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Social</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c20">Ad</span><span class="c5">opt</span><span class="c0">ed</span><span class="c8">: Congratulations, you were adopted! Jokes aside, how good this is depends on what race you were adopted by, as this COULD let you get some </span><span class="c2">excellent traits. At the same time, a lot of racial traits are the same as other social traits, so you might just wind up spending two trait slots for what could have been handled by one.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Bruising Intellect</span><span class="c8">: Int to intimidate, a skill you likely won&rsquo;t make the best use of, but might be worth it if you&rsquo;re creative.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Student of Philosophy</span><span class="c2">: For most purposes this is just Int instead of Cha for both Diplomacy and Bluff, so if you need to be the party face and dumped charisma, here&rsquo;s your trait!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Seeker</span><span class="c8">: Perception as a class skill and a +1 trait bonus to it, covering the fact that you lost it by going Warlock!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Hunter&rsquo;s Blood</span><span class="c2">: +1 bonus to Diplomacy, Knowledge (Religion), and Survival when related to undead. Choose one of these skills as a class skill. You already have Diplomacy, Survival is kind of helpful, but Knowledge (Religion) is a good skill to have. If your campaign features lots of undead, this is an excellent trait, otherwise&hellip; Well, it&rsquo;s still a class skill.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">Natural-Born Leader</span><span class="c2">: All cohorts, followers, or summoned creatures under your leadership gain a +1 morale bonus on Will saves to avoid mind-affecting effects. If you take Leadership, you gain a +1 bonus to your Leadership score. If for some reason you are allowed to take leadership, or are allowed to give the bonus to allied PCs, it&rsquo;s a pretty cool bonus&hellip; But it&rsquo;s really situational, and assumes that Leadership is available for you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">Wicked Leader</span><span class="c8">: It&rsquo;s similar to the above trait, except exclusively for </span><span class="c12 c8"><a class="c15" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.d20pfsrd.com/traits/social-traits/wicked-leader-social&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117583208000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3TXHbmE19MzPJnmZ0TCKQu">evil characters</a></span><span class="c2">, and it means your Cohort will only be one level behind, rather than two. If you&rsquo;re playing an evil character with leadership, it&rsquo;s your trait.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c20">Princess</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;(female only)</span><span class="c8">: +1 bonus to Diplomacy and Intimidate, and one of these (your choice) becomes a class skill. You already have both of these as a class skill, but the trait bonus is nice, and you can say you&rsquo;re a princess.</span></p><p class="c1 c16"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Racial</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Carefully Hidden</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;(Human)</span><span class="c8">: Oh baby, it&rsquo;s a +1 trait bonus to Will saves, which is nice to have, but it ALSO has a +2 trait bonus to saving throws versus divination effects. While that may not come up that often, it&rsquo;s in addition to a bonus to something that WILL come up often. </span><span class="c5">Auspicious Tattoo </span><span class="c2">is also a +1 to will saves, without the divination effect, so it&rsquo;s not as good.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Balloon Headed</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;(Goblin)</span><span class="c2">: +1 bonus on Perception, and Perception becomes a class skill. Any Escape Artist check that requires you to squeeze your head through a tight space take a &ndash;8 penalty. The downsides are actually very big, mainly because you have to play a Goblin to even take this trait, but perception IS the best skill.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Elven Reflexes</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;(Half-Elf) OR </span><span class="c9">Warrior of Old</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;(Elf)</span><span class="c8">: If you want a +2 initiative but don&rsquo;t want to get the stigma of taking reactionary, this is your trait.</span></p><p class="c1 c16"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Magic</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Pragmatic Activator</span><span class="c2">: Use your Int mod for UMD checks. You&rsquo;re probably going to want Tattoo Chamber, and UMD is one of the best skills in the game anyway, so it&rsquo;s a good idea to grab this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c20">Magical Knack</span><span class="c2">: What? Multiclassing? Ew, no, don&rsquo;t do that. You&rsquo;re going to do it anyway? Well fine, grab this and at least keep your caster level up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Magical Lineage</span><span class="c2">: A metamagic trait that is a staple for any blaster build. Unfortunately, you&rsquo;re not one of those blasters, but if you want to focus on a certain spell enough to get a metamagic feat, this will be a great help.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Spark of Creation</span><span class="c8">: You gain a +1 </span><span class="c8">trait bonus</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;on </span><span class="c8">Craft</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;checks, and the cost of creating magic items is reduced by 5%. Yea, you saw that right. There&rsquo;s also </span><span class="c5">Hedge Magician</span><span class="c8">, which only gives the reduction to magic item cost. The usefulness varies depending on just how much you intend to craft, or if your GM lets you craft at all.</span></p><p class="c1 c16"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Faith</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c20">Fate&rsquo;s</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Favored</span><span class="c2">: Here&rsquo;s a quick test for this. Do you have a constant luck bonus somehow? Then take this trait. If you don&rsquo;t? It can still be useful, but you probably want to pass.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Birthmark</span><span class="c2">: A +2 to saves vs charms and compulsions, and your body becomes a divine focus. You don&rsquo;t benefit from the latter half, but if you&rsquo;re worried about those pesky enchantment spells messing with your brain, this could give you a hand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Child of the Temple</span><span class="c8">: &nbsp;+1 trait bonus to Knowledge Nobility and Religion, pick one as a class skill. Barring a intrigue campaign with lots of nobles, you&rsquo;ll take Religion, unless your GM ignores the </span><span class="c12 c8"><a class="c15" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://paizo.com/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1h8%23v5748eaic9ukr&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117583212000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0o1Y7oWORCYe-9NhsaOo42">FAQ</a></span><span class="c2">&nbsp;for nobility.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Devotee of the Green</span><span class="c8">: +1 to Knowledge Geography and Nature, pick one as a c</span><span class="c2">lass skill. Nature is usually going to be used far more, so that&rsquo;s a safe bet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Indomitable Faith</span><span class="c2">: Oh boy, another +1 to a saving throw, this time it&rsquo;s just straight will for anyone! If you&rsquo;re a human or half-human race, Carefully Hidden is better.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Scholar of the Great Beyond</span><span class="c2">: A +1 trait bonus on Knowledge History and Planes, and pick one as a class skill. Planes is the real winner here, even though my favorite mages tend to be history nuts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c20">Unnatural Presence</span><span class="c8">: Do you like intimidating things? Do you want to intimidate animals and vermin? Then here you go. Unfortunately you are not an archetype that excels at intimidation, that&rsquo;s more the stalker specialization&rsquo;s thing.</span></p><p class="c1 c16"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Regional</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Dim Seer</span><span class="c2">: If you want to get Perception, keep your social talent open, and get a mechanical bonus for being the edgelord sitting in the dark corner of a tavern, does Paizo have the trait for you!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">[Under Construction]</span></p><p class="c1 c16"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Drawbacks</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">[Under Construction]</span></p><p class="c1 c16"><span class="c2"></span></p><a id="id.oxumnyq8tsxg"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c18 c10 c23 c21">Feats</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">There are an absolutely overwhelming BOATLOAD of feats in pathfinder.

You have a good will save, so this is a luxury feat, unless you&rsquo;re one of those people who really dig low wisdom characters, like JJ.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">Leadership</span><span class="c8">: It&rsquo;s busted. If it&rsquo;s legal and someone with higher charisma hasn&rsquo;t taken it, you should at least consider it.

If you have a feat </span><span class="c2">open somehow, go for it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Additional Traits</span><span class="c8">: Traits are fun, and sometimes they can make or break builds</span><span class="c2">. They likely won&rsquo;t be doing that on the warlock, but more traits are always fun.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Improved Familiar</span><span class="c8">: Improved familiars are nice. Their inability to take the majority of familiar archetypes sucks, but the g</span><span class="c8">aining a fairy or pseudodragon as a familiar is pretty sweet. Most are able to do UMD and sometimes they have some sweet SLAs, which is a plus!</span><sup><a href="#cmnt5" id="cmnt_ref5">[e]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt6" id="cmnt_ref6">[f]</a></sup></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c20">Cosmopolitan</span><span class="c8">: I can hear you now &ldquo;What the heck even is that?

Why would you take it? Well, it&rsquo;s functionally a much simpler version of Extra Traits for people who want more class skills, without spending trait slots. Is it worth taking? Not really, but I think it&rsquo;s at least worth mentioning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">Eldritch Heritage</span><span class="c8">: No. This requires Skill Focus and 13 Cha, and eats up feats you want to spend elsewhere. I love bloodlines, but a vanilla Warlock is actively hurting himself by taking this. It&rsquo;s not totally worthless, but it&rsquo;s going to require bending over backwards to justify it.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt7" id="cmnt_ref7">[g]</a></sup></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Possessed Hand</span><span class="c2">: You&rsquo;ve got a ghost in your hand that distracts you from spellcasting, but helps in other ways. That -2 on concentration checks sucks, but you shouldn&rsquo;t be casting spells if you&rsquo;re going to need to make those checks. On the flipside, a +1 insight bonus with attack and damage rolls made using that hand, as well as a few other minor bonuses, is pretty nifty. You&rsquo;ll likely only look at this late in your career. (Haunted Heroes Handbook, p25)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Hand&rsquo;s Autonomy</span><span class="c2">: This is&hellip; I don&rsquo;t really know how to actually rate this, so I&rsquo;m going to settle on green. It reduces TWF penalties (down to a minimum of -1) and lets your hand do a host of actions when you&rsquo;re unconscious, or otherwise unable to act.

There&rsquo;s little benefit to focusing on melee over ranged though, so there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with skipping this. It benefits all melee touch attacks though, if you happen to be making a lot of those via spells.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Point-Blank Shot</span><span class="c2">: Ah, Point-Blank Shot, the beginning of the mandatory feat tree for ranged combatants. As a Warlock this is excellent, as enemies will ALWAYS be within 30 ft of you, meaning it&rsquo;s effectively a permanent +1 to attack and damage rolls so long as you&rsquo;re attacking &ldquo;at range&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Precise Shot</span><span class="c2">: The second mandatory feat for ranged attackers, removing the penalty to hitting targets in a melee is always nice, but it&rsquo;s not very exciting.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c20">Combat Expertise</span><span class="c8">: Considering you&rsquo;re attacking touch AC, this isn&rsquo;t the worst feat to take, and it&rsquo;s a </span><span class="c2">prerequisite for a load of other feats&hellip; But you&rsquo;re already pretty feat-starved as-is.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c20">Moonlight Stalker</span><span class="c2">: The prerequisites are pretty hefty for a situational boost, but a +2 to attack and damage rolls is at least passable if you absolutely had to scrape out more bonuses.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">Moonlight Stalker Feint</span><span class="c2">: Feinting isn&rsquo;t very good, and this is a large investment for something you&rsquo;re going to get little benefit from.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">Moonlight Stalker Master</span><span class="c2">: Do I really have to explain why this is a bad idea?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c20">Improved Precise Shot</span><span class="c2">: I&rsquo;m disappointed by this, honestly. If your GM really likes partial cover and concealment below full, it might be a nice pickup for late levels, but there are way better things to spend those feats on.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">Clustered </span><span class="c10 c20">Shots</span><span class="c8">: It&rsquo;s very unfortunate for you that this feat doesn&rsquo;t say anything about totaling damage before applying </span><span class="c8 c13">energy resistance</span><span class="c8">, because you really could benefit from the feat if it did. I</span><span class="c8">t</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;you decide to grab a bow, you&rsquo;ll </span><span class="c8">get some mileage out of this</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;still</span><span class="c8">. If you can convince your GM to let your Mystic Bolts use this against energy resistances, though, it immediately becomes </span><span class="c0">Mandatory</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;for (I hope) very obvious reasons.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">Many</span><span class="c10 c20">shot</span><span class="c2">: If you&rsquo;re using a bow, you can feel free to grab it, otherwise ignore it entirely. Anyone with bow proficiency can just grab archery feats and do well, that doesn&rsquo;t make it good for you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Rapid Shot</span><span class="c2">: As is typical of ranged builds, an extra attack is always welcome. The -2 to hit is negligible considering you&rsquo;ll be hitting touch, and are more hurt by the fact that you can&rsquo;t get through energy resistances.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">Rapid Reload, Crossbow Mastery</span><span class="c2">: This feat is worthless for you, and you&rsquo;re the wrong class for doing anything with guns or crossbows. Drop them both off at some other sap&rsquo;s doorstep.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Two-Weapon Fighting, Improved, </span><span class="c5">Greater</span><span class="c2">: Since it works with both melee and ranged mystic bolts, the TWF feat chain is an absolutely amazing investment for a warlock. Anything without ridiculous touch AC or energy resistance will eat a barrage, which can give you a good bump in the damage department.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c20">Combat Reflexes</span><span class="c2">: Oh hey, more attacks of opportunity, and you&rsquo;re always armed, what&rsquo;s not to love? Well&hellip; Unless you take weapon finesse, you&rsquo;re not going to get much out of it, since all your good Dex score means is that you&rsquo;ll get more chances to miss your opponent with melee attacks of opportunity.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">Snap shot</span><span class="c2">: Oh look, a feat you can&rsquo;t get until really late, to let you do something you could just do with weapon finesse! If it let you attack with reach, it might be worth it, but...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c20">Improved Snap Shot</span><span class="c2">: Oh boy, TWO WHOLE FEATS (and combat reflexes too) in order to&hellip; Have 10 ft range on attacks of opportunity? Pass.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">Power Attack</span><span class="c2">: It&rsquo;s a good feat, but nothing you do actually lets you get the benefits of it without DM fiat. Pass.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">Piranha Strike</span><span class="c2">: Power Attack&rsquo;s Dex-based little brother, who has all the same problems and more. Pass again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">Deadly </span><span class="c10 c20">Aim</span><span class="c8">: </span><span class="c8">As power attack, your Mystic Bolts won&rsquo;t benefit from this without GM fiat, but it&rsquo;s one of the feats in the stock &ldquo;guy with a bow&rdquo; build. I&rsquo;ve seen people argue that &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t make your bolts touch attacks, it counts!&rdquo;, which could true&hellip; But then you&rsquo;re losing out on making touch attacks, which is a big thing Mystic Bolts have going for </span><span class="c8">them</span><sup><a href="#cmnt8" id="cmnt_ref8">[h]</a></sup><span class="c8">.</span></p><p class="c1 c16"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c27 c10">Crafting</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Craft Wondrous Items</span><span class="c2">: Really, if you&rsquo;re any Int-based caster and you have the opportunity, there&rsquo;s no real reason not to take this at SOME point. The sheer variety of wondrous items is frankly ridiculous, as is being able to have them for half price.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Craft Magical Arms and Armor</span><span class="c2">: Simply for the fact that this saves you and your party money, this is an okay feat. You&rsquo;re probably not the right person for it, though. It&rsquo;s lower than Craft Wondrous Items, but still excellent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c20">Inscribe Magical Tattoo</span><span class="c2">: &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t spell tattoos exorbitantly expensive and way worse than scrolls? There are only like, three wondrous tattoos, right?&rdquo; you ask? Well yes. It&rsquo;s also REALLY COOL. Depending on how far you read into it, you can even convert some wondrous items into tattoos. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s one of the more confusing feats, which means its usefulness is reliant on how your group interprets it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c20">Scribe Scroll, Brew Potion, Craft Wand</span><span class="c2">: These are all VERY situational, and would be better on a class that&rsquo;s less dependant on needing a ton of feats to function properly. I would pass on all of them as a general rule, unless you have something highly specific in mind.</span></p><p class="c1 c16"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Racial</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Racial Heritage</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;(Human)</span><span class="c2">: You count as a member of another race for the sake of prerequisites. There are far better uses of your bonus feat, but it&rsquo;s at least a fun option.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c20">Angelic Blood</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;(Aasimar)</span><span class="c2">: A wholly mediocre feat to eat up your limited supply, but it leads into...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Angel Wings</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;(Aasimar)</span><span class="c8">: For a regular old vigilante, this would be amazing, even with the prerequisites, simply because an anytime 30 ft fly speed is nice. For you it&rsquo;s decent but a bit mediocre, as the main ben</span><span class="c2">efit is getting Fly as a class skill and not needing to use a spell slot on Fly all the time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c20">Airy Step</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;(Sylph)</span><span class="c2">: Much like Angelic blood, this feat is situational and just serves as a tax for the next one. If you&rsquo;re worried about falling a lot, you can also pretend to be a cat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Wings of Air</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;(Sylph)</span><span class="c2">: You increase the bonus from the prerequisite feat, and gain&hellip; Anytime supernatural flight equal to your base speed, with good maneuverability. It doesn&rsquo;t say you get Fly as a class skill, but per rules, having a Fly speed should net the class skill.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Bloodmarked Flight</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;(Skinwalker, Werebat)</span><span class="c8">: You gain an additional bestial feature fo</span><span class="c2">r your werebat form, and it&rsquo;s anytime flight! It&rsquo;s also poor maneuverability at best. On the bright side, you can take it very early (level 5, compared to level 11 or 9) and without needing any prereqs beyond race, which makes it at least acceptable. Like Wings of Air, despite not saying it gives you Fly as a class skill, having a Fly Speed should give it to you anyway.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c20">Swift Kitsune Shapeshifter</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;(Kitsune)</span><span class="c2">: &ldquo;Wait, don&rsquo;t you hate pathfinder&rsquo;s kitsune? Why cover their feats?&rdquo; you might ask? Hate is a strong word, I just highly recommend refluffing. Why am I covering this in particular? Well if you take a look at what it leads too...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c20">Vulpine Pounce</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;(Kitsune)</span><span class="c2">: If you&rsquo;re playing a melee warlock, you&rsquo;re often shit out of luck for ways to stay mobile and still attack. This feat lets you expend a swift action during a charge... To pounce. For you 1pp-only warlocks, this is awful for you, since trying to melee with mystic bolts is a joke at best. If you&rsquo;ve got 3pp handy? Kitsune wind up a good choice if you were looking to slap people with energy. Constantly needing to shapeshift is kind of annoying, and melee mystic bolts will always be worse than ranged, though.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Fox Shape</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;(Kitsune)</span><span class="c8">: I will admit I am very biased with this, especially since you can get it at level 1 as a racial feature. I&rsquo;d advise against Taking it normally, but if your GM says you&rsquo;re still able to use your Mystic Bolts normally in fox form, then this can just hop all the way to </span><span class="c9">blue</span><span class="c8">, </span><span class="c8">since being tiny all the time is amazing. It would be </span><span class="c0">purple</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;if you could also still use </span><span class="c8">spells</span><span class="c2">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">Kobold Confidence</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;(Kobold)</span><span class="c8">: This is red solely because you have to jump through spiked, flaming hoops to get to it it, nevermind that it&rsquo;s a feat that&rsquo;s Cha-based. Cha 13 AND being a kobold (or being Human and blowing a feat on Racial Heritage) is just&hellip; Seriously? ONLY consider this if you houseruled kobolds up to snuff and happen to be running with 3pp.</span></p><p class="c1 c16"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">3PP Feats</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12 c8 c13"><a class="c15" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/193021/Legendary-Vigilantes?affiliate_id%3D277724&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117583225000&amp;usg=AOvVaw263UXgHv6qf4cIF3n004YR">Legendary Vigilantes</a></span><span class="c17 c8 c13">&nbsp;by Legendary Games</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Just to reiterate, if you have access to these books, YOU ARE TAKING </span><span class="c0">Mystic Accuracy</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;at some point, and either </span><span class="c9">Charismatic Caster</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;or </span><span class="c0">Genius Vigilante</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;at first level.</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Go scroll back up to the section on 3pp content if you forgot why.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">Masked Identity</span><span class="c2">: This is redundant. If you somehow have an archetype that trades out dual identity, and you still want it, you could theoretically get some use out of it... But you&rsquo;re a vigilante for crying out loud!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c20">Masked Identity, Improved</span><span class="c2">: If you have Masked Identity or the Dual Identity feature, this is&hellip; Well, it&rsquo;s basically Skill Focus: Disguise by another name. On it&rsquo;s own, it&rsquo;s really lame, but what it leads up to...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Masked Identity, Greater</span><span class="c2">: This is the one of two ways to get an extra vigilante talent. Considering the power of talents, two feats to get another is totally a worthwhile trade. You only count half your level for qualifying, and must choose a general talent, but get your whole level for effect. Personally, I&rsquo;d rate this blue for ALL vigilantes, since you could easily make up for the two feats in the chain, depending on the talent. You lose out on this if you take either the Exposed or Consumed archetypes, however.</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 415.50px; height: 711.86px;"><img alt="FireEmblemHugh.png" src="images/image3.png" style="width: 415.50px; height: 711.86px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Cross Specialization</span><span class="c2">: You can qualify as a Vigilante with the Stalker or Avenger specialization, using your Vigilante level -4 for the sake of qualifying for talents of that specialization. It&rsquo;s cool if you&rsquo;re dying for specific talents (stuff like Signature Weapon, Unkillable, and Mad Rush come to mind), but it falls a little flat. You already have a wide variety of base talents from this book alone, plus your warlock talents, and tons of better ways to spend your feats.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c20">Signature Talent</span><span class="c2">: This is a bit of a wonky feat, since it reduces the level requirement of a specific talent, as well as any talents it requires, by 2. You also get a bonus effect depending on the talent. An extra +1 to the DC, or +1 to attack rolls while using the talent, is a pretty nice boost, but there&rsquo;s not a whole lot of talents you&rsquo;re going to be itching to get early.</span></p><p class="c1 c16"><span class="c17 c8 c13"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12 c8 c13"><a class="c15" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/197617/Legendary-Villains-Vigilantes?affiliate_id%3D277724&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117583226000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2FPUC9yw_CMmfg5KskCKm3">Legendary Villains: Vigilantes</a></span><span class="c8 c13">&nbsp;by Legendary Games</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c20">Extra Social Talent</span><span class="c2">: Social talents range from being as good as the average feat, to &ldquo;very underwhelming&rdquo;. That said, if you wanted one of those niche talents and don&rsquo;t have anything better, it&rsquo;s not a completely unworthy trade.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Sniper Bolts</span><span class="c2">: A boost to, that even scales up with levels. It starts by adding 15 ft, and increases by an additional 15 ft at 6th, 12th, and 18th levels. It does screw up your relationship with Point Blank Shot, and you&rsquo;ll never catch up to a longbow, but you&rsquo;ve got more range than most close-range spells.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Explosive Bolts</span><span class="c2">: As the name might imply, this makes your bolts detonate when they hit their target, dealing damage to anything nearby with a reflex for splashed targets to halve the damage. It only procs off of ranged bolts, but the save DC scales up with level. If you&rsquo;re fighting crowds of enemies that get clustered together, this could be absolutely devastating.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vigilante Casting Savant</span><span class="c2">: Do you hate having so many talents to choose from, but so few chances to grab them? Well here you go, you get to grab an extra talent, just as though you had gotten one normally! It requires level 5, but doesn&rsquo;t say you can take it multiple times. That&rsquo;s a bummer, but another talent at all is excellent!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">Vigilante Savant</span><span class="c2">: You can&rsquo;t take this AND Vigilante Casting Savant. It opens up at level 7, and treats your level as half for the sake of qualifying for talents, so it&rsquo;s a direct downgrade for you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c20">Wise Vigilante</span><span class="c2">: Where Genius Vigilante made all your features Int-based to match spellcasting, and Charismatic Caster shifted you to a spontaneous Cha-caster to match your class features, this shifts all your vigilante features to Wisdom. But doesn&rsquo;t touch your spellcasting, which kinda kills its appeal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Forbidden Vigilante Knowledge</span><span class="c2">: You&rsquo;ll have to scroll down to see just WHY this is so good, but this actually gives you the spells that Magical Limit Break gives you slots for. As-written it doesn&rsquo;t work with spontaneous casting, but word is there&rsquo;s an errata on that coming &ldquo;Soon&trade;&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c1 c16"><span class="c2"></span></p><a id="id.l1ksxh5ckjtm"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c18 c10 c23 c21">6. Vigilante Talents</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Hoho, oh wow there are a lot of talents that are terrible for the Warlock. As is typical of pathfinder, there&rsquo;s always some stinkers in any list of abilities, but almost all of the base talents are terrible choices, since they either don&rsquo;t work at all for you, or take up talents that would be better in other things.</span></p><p class="c1 c16"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c27">Base Talents</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c20">Lethal Grace</span><span class="c2">: If you intend to use a normal finesse weapon without Dex-to-Damage it&rsquo;s great! But you don&rsquo;t get the scaling damage bonus with Mystic Bolts, so you miss out on the only real benefit of the talent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c20">Inspired Vigilante</span><span class="c2">: Gimped investigator inspiration, with no way to get free uses. Definitely not worth one of your talents.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">Perfect Vulnerability</span><span class="c2">: This ability is nigh-useless for you, because you&rsquo;re going to be targeting Touch AC anyway, and hitting flat-footed isn&rsquo;t all that helpful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c20">Shadow&rsquo;s Sight</span><span class="c2">: Low-Light and Darkvision are both really good to have, but not an amazing use of your limited talents. If you want this, why not get it from your race choice?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c20">Shadow&rsquo;s Speed</span><span class="c8">: I like going fast, and extra base speed is cool, but again, limited number of talents.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">Shield of Blades</span><span class="c2">: This ability just doesn&rsquo;t work for you at all. It would be yellow if only for warlocks who decide to use melee weapons, EXCEPT you MUST be using your STR mod to damage, and you must still meet all the feat prerequisites.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c20">Strike the </span><span class="c5">Unseen</span><span class="c2">: For the most part this is kind of useless for a warlock, but getting all these bonus feats for one talent is pretty sweet. The defensive benefits are pretty nice if that kind of thing comes up a lot, too. It lets you get at Moonlight Stalker, so there&rsquo;s that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">Sure-Footed</span><span class="c2">: Ahahahaaa, for a normal vigilante this might be amazing, but you&rsquo;re a 6th level spellcaster. You&rsquo;re going to be flying around and using invisibility.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">Vital Punishment</span><span class="c2">: If your Mystic Bolts had ANY damage dice scaling at all, this might actually be a cool talent to invest in. Alas, it was not meant to be.</span></p><p class="c1 c16"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Warlock Talents</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c20">Arcane</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Striker</span><span class="c8">: Simply put, Arcane Strike as a bonus feat is the biggest slap in the </span><span class="c8">face</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;to the terrible scaling of Mystic Bolts possible... But you&rsquo;re probably going to want it anyway. You have to wait until </span><span class="c8 c13">level 12</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;before you get any additional effect to make this talent better than just getting the feat, and you still have to spend a swift action to activate it, meaning if you ever have to spend an immediate action on anything you&rsquo;re going to cut your flat damage in (about) HALF. If your</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">campaign is ever going to get to level 12 or higher, you&rsquo;re going to want to pick it up anyway, but it&rsquo;s a very lackluster talent before then.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c20">Elemental</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Armor</span><span class="c2">: A scaling resistance to one energy type, as well as dealing damage to anything that attacks you. It&rsquo;s not a good choice early on, but at 16th level you become immune to one energy type. It&rsquo;s functional, and getting an immunity is always nice, though you have tons of ways to avoid the damage altogether.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Familiar</span><span class="c2">: I do not have to explain why familiars are amazing. That you can get one with multiple identities is just gravy, though I don&rsquo;t know how that interacts with Improved Familiar.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Social Simulacrum</span><span class="c2">: [Explanation Soon&trade;, I swear!]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Tattoo Chamber</span><span class="c2">: Now THIS is a talent. If I had the time, I could probably write a whole section on this ability alone. You can store one item, plus an additional item per 3 warlock levels, in a tattoo on your wrist, and can remove it with a swift action. If it&rsquo;s a spell-trigger item, you can use it while it&rsquo;s still in your tattoo, letting you keep your hand free! Slap your favorite wands into your wrist and go nuts!</span></p><p class="c1 c16"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">3PP Talents</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12 c8 c13"><a class="c15" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/193021/Legendary-Vigilantes?affiliate_id%3D277724&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117583230000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2DomWdoK0QICBfZBz4ypV2">Legendary Vigilantes</a></span><span class="c8 c13">&nbsp;by Legendary Games</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">Deft Shot</span><span class="c8">: Dex to damage capped by your level, for either firearms, crossbows... Or your Mystic Bolts. This damage doesn&rsquo;t stack with </span><span class="c0">Mystic Accuracy</span><span class="c2">, so just save your talents. You really don&rsquo;t need to bother with firearms or crossbows.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c20">Diamond Determination</span><span class="c2">: Toughness and Great Fortitude mashed into a talent. An okay bandaid for the Vigilante&rsquo;s poor Fort save and low HD, but not exactly the best choice for a talent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Furious Flurry</span><span class="c2">: Trade one talent for Two-Weapon Fighting, and automatic progression of the Two-Weapon Fighting feat chain at 8th and 15th level. For a single talent, this is a solid investment, but it doesn&rsquo;t really start to pay off until 8th level, which might be the tail end of some games.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c20">Spell</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Master</span><span class="c2">: Early on, this doesn&rsquo;t do a whole lot for you. Not needing to make UMD rolls for any spell on a chosen spell list is nice, but not needing UMD is only a marginal advantage. At 6th level, you can add your Charisma modifier (or your Intelligence modifier with Genius Vigilante) to DCs, which is actually very nice if you use some of the cheaper utility wands. At 12th level, when combined with Tattoo Chamber, this talent could get downright ridiculous with the right wands, since you&rsquo;re now using your vigilante level in place of the caster level of the wand. If your familiar can benefit from this somehow, I&rsquo;d need a new color.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c20">Swift Defence</span><span class="c2">: You get the AC bonus of a Brawler. It&rsquo;s&hellip; Not great. You&rsquo;re likely going to have High Dex and plenty of defensive spells. Funnily, Jolly actually mentioned that he thought the Brawler got the same kind of AC bonus as a Monk, but decided against changing this talent to reflect that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c20">*Steel Body</span><span class="c8">: Have you ever looked at a Barbarian and said &ldquo;man, I sure wish I had his DR/-&rdquo;? Well, if for some bizarre reason you have, here it is, and it even acts like it for purposes of determining what stacks. It&rsquo;s DR 1/-, increasing by 1 at 8th and every 4 levels, capping at 5/- at 20th level.</span></p><p class="c1 c16"><span class="c17 c8 c13"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12 c8 c13"><a class="c15" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/197617/Legendary-Villains-Vigilantes?affiliate_id%3D277724&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117583231000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0pQB4Yg6xb3pD6233r8YJI">Legendary Villains: Vigilantes</a></span><span class="c8 c13">&nbsp;by Legendary Games</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c20">Beast Brethren</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c10 c20">Beastmaster</span><span class="c8">: Anyone familiar with animal companions probably knows about Animal Ally. This is </span><span class="c12 c8"><a class="c15" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/animal-ally&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117583232000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2hhczvk9wNv-4Fk4Qa4iHJ">Animal Ally</a></span><span class="c8">&nbsp;and its prerequisite rolled into one. Beastmaster requires level 6, hands you Boon Companion, then lets you pick up a companion off the druid list if you so desire. Two talents, and only picking from the full list at 6 kind of kills it for me, even though I really love my animal companions.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Bloody Wrath</span><span class="c2">: This is probably the edgiest thing you could possibly take, but it&rsquo;s almost comically effective if you want to have a &ldquo;blood mage&rdquo; theme. If you suffer from a bleed effect, you gain a bonus to attack and damage rolls that scales up. In addition, so long as you have the means handy, you can cut yourself as a swift action to cause 1 point of bleed damage a round, taking more damage as the benefits go up. If you feel like living dangerously, it could be a good alternative to arcane strike. Or you can stack it with arcane strike for even more boosts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Critical Violence</span><span class="c8">: Yo dawg, I heard you liked crits. Since your Mystic Bolts are considered a light weapon for the sake of feats that call for a specific weapon, they do in fact qualify here, as confirmed by a writer. This increases your crit range by 1, and by 2 at 12th level, meaning you net an 18-20 crit range by 12th level. If you take Improved Critical, this would only increase to a 17-20, since the talent&rsquo;s increase is applied after that feat, but it&rsquo;s still a pretty good deal for mid levels.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c20">Critical Virtuoso</span><span class="c2">: On the flipside to the above is this little number, which is Critical Focus and Improved Critical bundled together, with the added bonus of treating your class level as your BaB for qualifying for critical feats. Honestly, you&rsquo;re not much of a crit-fisher, and while the benefits are nice, you&rsquo;re really better off looking elsewhere with your talents.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Ranged Adept</span><span class="c2">: This Point-Blank and Precise Shot rolled into one, with the added benefit of the (slightly superfluous) Point-Blank Master at level 8. This lets you have Genius Vigilante, Mystic Accuracy, and either Rapid Shot or Deadly Aim by level 3! It&rsquo;s not too exciting, but anything to ease the feat tax of ranged combat is helpful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c20">Improved Familiar</span><span class="c2">: This is, to be perfectly honest, a bit of a waste. It&rsquo;s Improved Familiar, with a clause that lets you give the familiar an archetype it might not otherwise qualify for. If you want your Lyrakien Azata to have the Valet archetype, now you can! But if you wanted her to have Sage, I&rsquo;m pretty sure she could already do that. It really should have let your familiar swap between two forms to be worthwhile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Lethal Locks</span><span class="c8">: I&rsquo;m giggling at this, partly because this is an amazing talent, partly because the mental image is hilarious. It&rsquo;s an all-day Prehensile Hair</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;hex, which is pretty darn useful if you want to keep your hands free, or deliver a touch spell from a distance... But it then gets scaling damage dice, and can count as a manufactured weapon for iteratives. Meaning you can full attack with your hair. If it wasn&rsquo;t for the fact that there&rsquo;s so many things to boost Mystic Bolts, I would tell you that you should pick this up first and just use it instead, but those Mystic Bolts barely scrape ahead of it. It&rsquo;s still totally worth nabbing, since an extra limb and increased touch attack range is pretty sweet. </span><span class="c8 c13">Even though this is a guide for the Warlock, it&rsquo;s worth chiming in to say that for other Vigilantes this is totally worth being considered a </span><span class="c9 c13">Blue</span><span class="c17 c8 c13">&nbsp;talent. At least in my opinion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Magical Limit Break</span><span class="c2">: Knock knock, 7th level spell slots called. You want this and Forbidden Vigilante Knowledge as soon as you can get them so that you can be a 7th level caster, which means levels 17-18 at LEAST, but if you somehow make it to 20th level you can take it a second time to hit 8th level spells. You have fewer per-day slots than a real fullcaster, but who cares? Unfortunately, by the time it actually gets going, most games will likely be over.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">[Under Revision]</span></p><p class="c1 c16"><span class="c2"></span></p><a id="id.78tpxm3a8c1u"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c18">Social Talents</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Two sets of talents? TWO sets of talents? This part always gets me about the Vigilante, because it was how a martial should be designed in the first place. The Warlock archetype is a Gish though, and you STILL get all those talents by default, which is pretty sweet.</span></p><p class="c1 c16"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Base Talents</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c20">Any Guise</span><span class="c8">: If this came earlier, it would be a really good ability&hellip; But it&rsquo;s just so LATE</span><span class="c8">. Many Guises comes online way sooner, and has easier utility. If you want to be a specific person, just use some magic and hope your GM doesn&rsquo;t have scry-and-die wizards looking for you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Renown</span><span class="c8">: While this leads into some pretty nice stuff, renown on it&rsquo;s own is really bad. A small village of 200 people who know about your vigilante identity, and an intimidate bonus? And you need to spend 4 hours every day for a whole week to transfer it? Unfortunately, without renown your list of social talents is practically slashed in half. </span><span class="c10">Note</span><span class="c2">: As noted in another guide, this actually affects a mile radius around your area of renown, making it much better.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Obscurity</span><span class="c8">: The Flipside of Renown, rather than making you more well known, it lets you become nobody important and not need to worry about someone seeing through you. It functions otherwise the same, and lets you take most of the same talents, meaning it suffers about as much as Renown does. </span><span class="c17 c8 c13">(Blood of the Beast, p.15)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Great Renown</span><span class="c2">: Okay, now we&rsquo;re picking up to something more reasonable, increasing the maximum to a town of 5,000 people, or two smaller towns of 2,000 each. That&rsquo;s a BIG jump, and almost makes up for the base talent being so mediocre. It&rsquo;s still kind of finicky, though.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Incredible Renown</span><span class="c2">: You multiply the number of people that know about your vigilante identity from Great renown by 5, and have an even bigger intimidate bonus. 25,000 people in a largy city, or 10,000 in two smaller cities is nothing to sneeze at.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Instant Recognition</span><span class="c2">: If you&rsquo;re going to take renown, and you need to move around a lot, spending a whole week to transfer your &ldquo;place of renown&rdquo; is a pain. Cutting that down from 4 hours every day for a whole week to just 4 hours for a single day? If you&rsquo;re even using renown at all, just pick this up and save your party the headache.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c20">Feign</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Innocence</span><span class="c8">: Within his area of renown, this provides a non-magical effect identical to the </span><span class="c8">Innocence</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;spell for a Vigilante&rsquo;s Social identity. If you don&rsquo;t tend to stick around your area of renown, or have a small area to work with, this isn&rsquo;t going to do much&hellip; But if you do, and also happen to be doing a lot of lying in an intrigue game, it&rsquo;s very handy!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c20">Subjective </span><span class="c5">Truth</span><span class="c2">: This is slightly better than Feign Innocence, mostly because it seems to work outside your area of renown. Unfortunately, it still requires you to take that talent, and it&rsquo;s still VERY situational. For heavy intrigue games it&rsquo;s a nice thing to have in your pocket.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Safe House</span><span class="c8">: This is kind of cool. You get a safe house that gets progressively larger and harder to find. If you have renown, you can also move this from place to place, which is pretty good if you like having a hidden home </span><span class="c8">base</span><sup><a href="#cmnt9" id="cmnt_ref9">[i]</a></sup><span class="c2">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Social Graces</span><span class="c8">: You get to pick any one </span><span class="c8">Int-</span><span class="c8">, </span><span class="c8">Wis-</span><span class="c8">, or </span><span class="c8">Cha-</span><span class="c8">based skill other than </span><span class="c8">Perception</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;or UMD, and get a +4 Circumstance bonus in your social identity. At 5th level, and every 4 levels, you add this bonus to another skill with the same parameters. This is a nice bonus, even if there&rsquo;s lots of ways to get better circumstance bonuses, and is still infinitely better than something like Skill Focus.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">Seamless Shapechanger</span><span class="c8">: Do you just REALLY want to pretend to be something else when your shapechanger polymorphs? Well here you go, this lets you add that Seamless Guise bonus on those disguise checks.

It&rsquo;s mostly a talent all about the flavor, since it&rsquo;s not really much of an upgrade from just taking Quick and Immediate change. Though it does let you swap identities with a mere swift action with Immediate Change. </span><span class="c17 c8 c13">(Blood of the Beast, p.15)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Quick Change</span><span class="c8 c24">, </span><span class="c5">Immediate Change</span><span class="c8">: Two talents that should really just be part of the base class. Quick Change means that you only need two full-round actions to totally change identities, and Immediate change drops this to just a move action to </span><span class="c8">completely</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;change guises.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Many Guises</span><span class="c2">: This ability is silly. Instead of a Social or Vigilante identity, you get the third option of just being a &ldquo;mundane&rdquo; member of your race, receiving a big ol&rsquo; +20 circumstance bonus on disguise checks to appear as a boring old joe shmoe. There&rsquo;s all kinds of uses for this, especially if you need to hide from the big bad diviners.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Mockingbird</span><span class="c2">: You get Ghost Sound, Ventriloquism, and Vocal Alteration as at-will, Extraordinary abilities, rather than as SLAs. You get to skip needing to prepare them, can do them at-will, AND you don&rsquo;t need to worry about things that screw over spells? Well dang, sign me up!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Double Time</span><span class="c2">: Do you happen to want to do a lot of mundane crafting? Yes? Take this, then take Social Graces.

This gives you an enhancement bonus for Mystic Bolts despite the &ldquo;limitation&rdquo;, but you pay the same price as an AoMF for each +1, with similar limits. On the bright side, instead of ignoring DR like a normal enhancement bonus (since you ignore it anyway), for every +1, you ignore 3 energy resistance of any target, up to 15.

The quality of powers all depend on what bloodline you take, and this becomes a much better choice if you&rsquo;re allowed 3pp. If you&rsquo;re doing a high level campaign and don&rsquo;t mind the hoops, Eldritch Heritage gets you the 15th level power sooner (17 instead of 19).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c20">Magus</span><span class="c8">: Eldritch Pool by RAW doesn&rsquo;t work on your Mystic Bolts (as it enhances a </span><span class="c8 c13">single specific weapon</span><span class="c8">), so that&rsquo;s already a potential strike.

They give you an extra 1d6 acid damage per attack, which adds up quick when rapid shot+twfing. Demonic Smith&#39;s Gloves add 1d6 fire damage for the same price, but are fire damage and from a soft cover.</span></p></div><div class="c6"><p class="c3"><a href="#cmnt_ref21" id="cmnt21">[u]</a><span class="c11">One up of Demonic Smith&#39;s over Deliquescent is that they&#39;ll stack with Arcane Striker giving the Flaming property (acid has no such property) and be reduced by energy resistance only once.</span></p></div><div class="c6"><p class="c3"><a href="#cmnt_ref22" id="cmnt22">[v]</a><span class="c11">Ranger has a lot going for it as a gestalt option. It gets you full BAB, d10 hit die, good fortitude saves, favored enemy grants a bonus to the damage of your mystic bolts, combat style lets you sneak past some feat pre-reqs (Mystic Bolt Switch Hitter anyone?) and it rounds out your stealth tricks even further. Favored Terrain (Urban) is also a flavorful option. As for concerns over needing Wisdom, you can get by on a 12 and an int+wis headband without much trouble and if you pick Skirmisher or Trapper you can go down to the 10 that no character should ever go below without issue.</span></p></div><div class="c6"><p class="c3"><a href="#cmnt_ref23" id="cmnt23">[w]</a><span class="c11">Unchained Rogue or Slayer could also do well I think. The main draw of Rogue is Full Attack, Sneak Attack, Touch Attack via Mystic Bolts since sneak attack works with literally anything that requires an attack roll and deals damage. Debilitating strike is a nice side of debuffing if your target manages to survive, the attack penalty on powerful sneak becomes irrelevant in most cases because touch attacks and rogue talents go a long way towards making up for the general Vigilante Talents you won&#39;t really have the slots to take. Slayer doesn&#39;t give the same kind of insane sneak attack damage, studied target also works with Mystic Bolts and you get full BAB and a better Fort save to make up for it so it may actually be better in the end. No clue of archetypes affect either since I didn&#39;t take a look at that.</span></p></div><div class="c6"><p class="c3"><a href="#cmnt_ref24" id="cmnt24">[x]</a><span class="c11">Thought of another option if you&#39;ve got the feat that changes Warlock to be Cha based, one that may seem counter productive at first: Bard. The thing is though that a lot of masked vigilante types get very sassy in battle which could easily be taken to be perform (comedy), not to mention that many have a significant flair for the dramatic and there are a lot that aren&#39;t too subtle once combat has started anyways. So there&#39;s not as much of a flavor clash as one might think. Mechanically speaking, Inspire Courage increases the damage of Mystic Bolts, the bard chassis puts skills up to 6+int/level again and versatile performance+Bardic Knowledge makes that last even longer and if you want something more subtle you can always be an Archeologist (hello Fate&#39;s Favored).</span></p></div><div class="c6"><p class="c3"><a href="#cmnt_ref25" id="cmnt25">[y]</a><span class="c11">I think this might be better than you give it credit for, the problem just is that you would primarily be a Magus in combat with the Warlock Vigilante part mainly supplying utility, skill width and the whole Dual Identity sthick. That being said, with the Magus Discovery to do spellstrike/spellcombat with spells from another class, you get some touch spell gems from the Sorcerer/Wizard class and you should be ashamed of yourself if you run out of spells with two 6th level casting arrays keyed off of the same ability score. Mystic Bolts, meanwhile, just become a supercantrip for use at times where you can&#39;t cast spells, or where you have iteratives left and no enemies in melee reach since you&#39;ve a hand free anyways.</span></p></div><div class="c6"><p class="c3"><a href="#cmnt_ref26" id="cmnt26">[z]</a><span class="c11">Though it occurs to me that you could probably Spell Combat/Spell Strike with your melee Mystic Bolts if both hands are free. Probably not worth building around but it could be a useful trick to have up your sleeve against a target that has little/no resistance to one of your energy types and lots of DR.</span></p></div><div class="c6"><p class="c3"><a href="#cmnt_ref27" id="cmnt27">[aa]</a><span class="c11">Slayer is a good gestalt pairing in general and works here. Full BAB, good fort (and ref) save, good skills, medium armor (remember PF requires original prof for mithral armor), sneak attack, which you can trigger easily with improved invisibility, helps your low damage. Slayer Talents can be turned into feats (you&#39;ll be taking TWF or archery feats anyways). Studied Target may help.</span></p></div><div class="c6"><p class="c3"><a href="#cmnt_ref28" id="cmnt28">[ab]</a><span class="c11">Worth mentioning Warrior for groups that do tier based Gestalt (Where Warlock Vigilante is Tier 3 and can gestalt with an NPC class). Full BAB, fort save, bigger HD and medium armor proficiency (for mithril) beats Expert (Slightly more skill points and any class skill you want), Adept (spells that work off a stats you don&#39;t care too much about) and Aristocrat (Nothing).</span></p></div><div class="c6"><p class="c3"><a href="#cmnt_ref29" id="cmnt29">[ac]</a><span class="c11">Also as long as you&#39;re mentioning Path of War under Rogue, Warder is amazing (Int based full BAB chassis) .</span></p></div><div class="c6"><p class="c3"><a href="#cmnt_ref30" id="cmnt30">[ad]</a><span class="c11">Do you think a quick section how to roleplay a warlock?

It is interesting to think about, so I&#39;ll have to try jotting down some ideas at some point. The fluff is pretty flexible, so you can probably get away with a ton of variation.</span></p></div></body></html>
