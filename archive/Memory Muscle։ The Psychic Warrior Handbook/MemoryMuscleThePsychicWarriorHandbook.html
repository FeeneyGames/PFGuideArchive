Pathfinder, and wanted to play a Psychic Warrior. There are already two psychic warrior handbooks, but they&rsquo;re both very incomplete. Neither was able to complete a review of equipment or feats, two things that are essential for any martial character in a 3.5 or Pathfinder game. I figured I was about to go splatbook diving through feats and refreshing myself on equipment choices, so I might as well write down and share my opinions and make this guide while I did so.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c17 c3">Ratings Guide</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c14 c0">Incredible</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;-

Psychic Warriors have better self buffs than the Magus and Warpriest, and are able to train themselves to fill any combat role a party needs. They are also for players who would rather use psionics than magic. &nbsp;Psychic Warriors can be vicious assassins, intimidating juggernauts, masters of battlefield control, steadfast bulwarks for their allies, rapid-fire archers, and everything in between. </span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c17 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Who shouldn&rsquo;t play a Psychic Warrior</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0">People who want to use their power to play god</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;-</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;You aren&rsquo;t a Psion, a wizard, or a sorcerer. Even a Warpriest is superior in this regard. You don&rsquo;t buff you allies, debuff your enemies, or control the battlefield en masse with your powers.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0">People who want to use their power to blast enemies away</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- Psychic Warriors don&rsquo;t use their powers to blast enemies away. They use them to make themselves stronger and then crush enemies with their attacks.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0">People who want to be social butterflies</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- You can manage some tasks in social encounters, but you don&rsquo;t have the skill points, ability scores, or powers to control any room you walk into.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c20 c3 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c17 c3">Why Use Psionics</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0">Augmentation</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- Augmentation allows a manifesters to change the duration, DC, range, and effect of powers by spending more power points when they manifest them. This means that many 1st level powers have staying power that will last through an adventurer&rsquo;s entire career. The downside is that, unlike with arcane or divine spells, many psionic powers&rsquo;s &rsquo;primary effects do not automatically scale in effect with level. The upside is that you can custom tailor every power you manifest to the situation at hand.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0">No fancy books or holy symbols, and no flashy material, vocal, or somatic components required</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- You don&rsquo;t need to so much as wiggle a finger to manifest a power. &nbsp;In their place you have displays, which are usually much more subtle, and can be eliminated with a free DC 15+power level concentration check. You are not a stolen book or sundered divine focus away from being useless, and you can manifest your powers much more surreptitiously. </span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0">Nova</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- &ldquo;Nova&rdquo; as in &ldquo;Supernova.&rdquo; Meaning to burn brightly in a massive explosion of force and energy and then completely disappear. Psionicists burn brighter and faster than any other class in Pathfinder. Psychic Warriors, given the opportunity, can blow through their entire daily reserve of power points in a handful of rounds, turning themselves into nigh invulnerable killing machines. GMs would be wise to force any psionic character to face multiple encounters a day</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c5 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><a id="id.qwv911envyny"></a><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c26 c3">Important Psionics Concepts/Rules</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c3">The Golden Rule of Psionics</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0">You can not use more power points when you manifest a power than your manifester level. If your effective manifester level for a power is 7, then you can not spend more than 7 power points when manifesting it. Drill that into your head.</span></p><p class="c1 c5 c9"><span class="c17 c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c17 c3">Displays</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4 c0">Instead of verbal, somatic, or material components, psionics uses displays. Every power has a display, but not necessarily all the displays. There are 5 kinds: auditory, material, mental, olfactory, and visual. Know which display your power uses because it can allow for much more subtle application of powers. For example, auditory, mental and olfactory displays have options to make it so that the power&rsquo;s manifestation can only be noticed by creatures within 20 ft of the manifester. That is a massive advantage compared to spells which require you to stand yelling and waving your arms, letting everyone know you just cast a spell. </span></p><p class="c1 c5 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4 c0">If that&rsquo;s not subtle enough, manifesters can make a DC 15+power level concentration check to eliminate the display from the power entirely. There isn&rsquo;t any penalty to attempting to remove a display, even on a failure. </span></p><p class="c1 c5 c9"><span class="c4 c22"></span></p><p class="c1 c5 c9"><span class="c4 c22"></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c17 c3">Metapsionics: Points vs. Spell Levels</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0">Metapsionic feats virtually always require you to expend your psionic focus in order to use them. Compared to metamagic, this can make them a tad less useful to use in combat. You can&rsquo;t throw out a quickened empowered </span><span class="c23 c0">fireball</span><span class="c0">, and then immediately throw out an extended </span><span class="c23 c0">wall of force</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;without additional feat investment, for example. In exchange your metapsionics are almost always, effectively 1 power level cheaper after augmentation than metamagic. Empower power only costs 2 extra power points, compared to empower spell costing 2 spell levels. Maximize power only costs 4 extra power points. Lingering power doesn&rsquo;t cost any extra power points. Manifesters will be able to use metapsionics on more power effects than arcane casters will, be able to use them sooner, and can use them more efficiently. </span></p><p class="c1 c5 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0">Because you&rsquo;re using power points and not spell levels, your ability to use metapsionics is not tied to your highest power level known, but to your manifester level. If you&rsquo;re an 11th level manifester, but for some reason only know 4th level powers (which cost 7 PP to manifest), you can spend 4 more points to manifest that power with metapsionics.</span></p><p class="c1 c5 c9"><span class="c4 c22"></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c17 c3">Psionic-Magic Transparency</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0">Now the assumed ruleset for psionics, this makes psionic detection powers much better. </span><span class="c23 c0">Detect psionics</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;works on magic and </span><span class="c23 c0">detect magic</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;works on psionics. </span><span class="c23 c0">Anti-magic field</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c23 c0">dispel magic</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;now counter psionic powers. </span><span class="c23 c0">Dispel psionics</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c23 c0">null psionics </span><span class="c23 c0">field</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;now counter magic spells &nbsp;Dead magic areas and planes are now also dead psionics areas and planes. Bonuses of the same type do not stack even if they are from both spells and powers.

You don&rsquo;t have a breadth of class features that let you support the party in any encounter no matter what you&rsquo;ve chosen to do so far. You are a class that will pick something and become elite at that while also finding other areas to contribute. </span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c20 c3 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0">Don&rsquo;t be a one trick pony</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- &ldquo;While finding other areas to contribute.&rdquo; If you&rsquo;re good at tripping, don&rsquo;t tailor you entire power list to make you better at tripping. Use powers and skills to add extra versatility. Pick one or two out of combat roles and specialize in them like you would combat.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0">Take a good look at prestige classes</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- After around level 6 or 7 your class abilities start to get a little less interesting. If you&rsquo;re looking for more abilities rather than larger bonuses, prestige classing and multiclassing will be the way to go. You have the bonus feats to make entry costs a little less steep.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c20 c26 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c26 c3">Roles for a Psychic Warrior</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c24 c0">Buffing Allies</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- At higher levels you might get some way to do this either through the share power feat or psionic tattoos, but almost all of your best buffing powers are personal range only.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0">Debuffing Enemies</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- You don&rsquo;t have a lot of ranged touch power or many save or suck powers, but you do have quite a few powers that trigger and do nasty things to enemies without allowing them a save when you hit them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c24 c0">Large Area Control</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- The Thunderjarl archetype can do this a little bit better than the normal psychic warrior, but your power list is pretty bereft of anything even as good as </span><span class="c23 c0">solid fog</span><span class="c0">, let alone </span><span class="c23 c0">cloudkill</span><span class="c4 c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0">Summ</span><span class="c3 c0 c6">oning</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- You could choose to take the </span><span class="c23 c0">astral construct</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;power with Expanded Knowledge, and get some utility from summoing.

There are few enemies that will actually manage to stand in your way when you go to move them or just move through them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8 c0">The Intimidator</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- This can often just be grafted onto many of other melee types, letting you make free single target and intimidate checks as you go along your business. You might struggle to be great at it, but it&rsquo;s not too hard to jump into.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8 c0">Master Grappler</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- You&rsquo;ll be good at grappling, possibly great even, but it&rsquo;s a style that struggles to scale into the late game.

This is true of every gish type class in Pathfinder, but it is particularly true of Psychic warriors. A Magus or Warpriest doesn&rsquo;t need to make a move action to regain his psionic focus.

A generous estimate for the number of power points a psychic warrior will end up with is around 230 power points. A Psion will end up with over 350 power points and 36 powers known. Most psychic warriors will rely on heavily augmenting at least one of </span><span class="c23 c0">inertial armor</span><span class="c0">, </span><span class="c23 c0">expansion</span><span class="c0">, or </span><span class="c23 c0">claws of the beast</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to keep those bonuses scaling into the late game</span><span class="c4 c0">.

Meanwhile, many of your psionic feats, metapsionic feats, path maneuvers, and psionic power triggers will call for you to expend your psionic focus to activate them at all. Certain priority feats lessen the burden, but exploiting these abilities too often can cripple a psychic warrior&rsquo;s action economy as they need long pauses in combat to regain their focus.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c22"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c22"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c22"></span></p><a id="id.fn5557jzf6jv"></a><p class="c32"><span class="c28 c3">Paths</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Warrior Paths are one of the key ways that you&rsquo;ll specialize your character.

They can be taken in place of bonus feats, but are generally more powerful and you can still take the feats instead if you need them.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3 c14 c0">Anima Infusion</span><span class="c13 c3 c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c0">- Immediate action manifestation of personal range powers is better than quicken on all your best powers and it only costs three animus.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c13 c3 c0">Animus Empowerment </span><span class="c0">- An extra +1 on all your weapons or +1d6 extra energy damage and </span><span class="c23 c0">ghost touch</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;is a nice unconditional boost, especially if you wield multiple weapons. Then it doubles in power at 12th level.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3 c8 c0">Durable Halo</span><span class="c13 c3 c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">- </span><span class="c0">DR &frac12;ClassLevel/- is never bad</span><span class="c4 c0">. This is a good pick for a passive boost.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3 c0 c6">Empowered Halation</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- Extra energy resistance and a stronger Durable Halo don&rsquo;t make up for this taking your immediate action and &nbsp;a point of animus every turn.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3 c24 c0">Kinetic Halo</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- Energy powers aren&rsquo;t great without Anima Flare, since you don&rsquo;t have a ton of PP. Still, this adds a bunch of powers to your list and gives you one of them as a power known, even if it&rsquo;s at your max power level.</span></p><p class="c1 c25"><span class="c3 c8 c0">Anima Flare</span><span class="c13 c3 c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c0">- Three animus for an energy power augmented to your class level makes you a pretty effective blaster. However, you can&rsquo;t use Metapsionic feats so you won&rsquo;t have the ceiling of a dedicated blaster. This also requires Kinetic Halo, which is pretty bad by itself.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c13 c3 c0">Palisade Wall</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- One animus and a free action to generate a hands-free tower shield with no attack or armor check penalty and a scaling enhancement bonus makes this beat out </span><span class="c23 c0">force screen</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;handily. It&rsquo;s not clear if you can bash with it. </span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c13 c3 c0">Restorative Halo</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- Two animus and a free action to give the whole party Fast Healing 5 for 3+Wis rounds gives the whole party a bit more endurance at no action cost to you</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c14 c0">Animus Manifestation</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- You can spend animus in place of power points when manifesting powers. You can even mix the two together in the same manifestation. This gives you a ton of added endurance and goes a long way to make up for your low PP pool. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8 c0">Improved Psychic Halo</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- Uncanny Dodge, Energy resistance and gaining your halo before you move is pretty good, but losing your second path hurts. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0">Blazing Halation</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- The extra Animus and retaliation damage aren&rsquo;t bad, but it&rsquo;s the ability to negate attacks that would drop you that&rsquo;s the main draw here. Still, twisting path and pathweaving are strong abilities to give up</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0 c6">Psionic Halation Endurance</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- Mainly a flavor ability, this is far weaker than Eternal Warrior.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c20 c26 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c26 c3">Martial Kineticist</span><span class="c26 c11">UP</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c0">The point of this archetype is to make you a better psionic manifester. In many ways it&rsquo;s an additional path choice, I&rsquo;ll format and review it as such to help show exactly what it&rsquo;s doing.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c0">The class loses martial weapon proficiency, heavy armor proficiency, medium armor proficiency, and proficiency with shields. It also loses the ability to take combat feats as bonus feats. In exchange you gain a scaling deflection bonus to armor class. Overall that&rsquo;s probably a bad deal.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0">Path Power</span><span class="c0">:</span><span class="c23 c0">&nbsp;energy ray</span><span class="c4 c0">. You don&rsquo;t really have the power points to take use of it like a psion, but it&rsquo;s a perfectly serviceable direct damage power for most of the game.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8 c0">Path Skills</span><span class="c4 c0">: Autohypnosis, Spellcraft, Use Magic Device</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c3 c0">New Class Skill</span><span class="c0">: </span><span class="c0">Use Magic Device</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;is a class skill.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0">Trance</span><span class="c4 c0">: May manifest ranged touch powers as a melee touch powers. Eventually you are able to make multiple melee touch attacks to deliver one power to multiple targets.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8 c0">Maneuver</span><span class="c4 c0">: Expend your psionic focus when you manifest a ranged touch attack as a melee touch attack and you gain temporary power points which may be used to augment the power. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c3 c0">Martial Focus</span><span class="c4 c0">: Three times/day, for 4 to 8 rounds, you can just act as if you are always maintaining your psionic focus, even when you&rsquo;re aren&rsquo;t maintaining it. Expending and regaining your psionic focus is one of the biggest hurdles that psionic characters have to work around. This will allow you far more flexibility in maintaining bonuses and manifesting powers</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8 c0">Psionic Riposte:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;You kind of get to manifest </span><span class="c23 c0">redopsi </span><span class="c0">as an immediate action. You have to throw an unknown amount of power points behind the ability unless you adequately identify it with a good spellcraft check. Your limited powers points, and the core limitation of </span><span class="c23 c0">redopsi</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">that the power has to be directed at you does limit this quite a bit.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Overall, the archetype is just a </span><span class="c3 c0">situationally good</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;option. Even though I&rsquo;d say most of the bonuses are actually pretty solid, they&rsquo;re all working to move you towards being a better manifester but do so by giving only 6 levels of access to one of the weaker discipline lists. I&rsquo;d probably recommend playing something like an Egoist Psion Gish over this archetype if this is the style you&rsquo;re interested in. </span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c26 c3 c8">Meditant</span><span class="c26 c11">UP</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You trade all of your armor proficiencies for the monk armor class bonus</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c0">You trade your martial weapon proficiencies for monk unarmed strike damage</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c0">Trade martial power for Flurry of Blows</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Trade the 8th level bonus feat for Monk weapon proficiency or Feral Combat Training</span><span class="c11 c0">UP</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Basically you&rsquo;re a monk that trades all of their esoteric abilities, good reflex and will saves, ki pool for the 6 levels of manifesting, Warrior Path, Secondary Path, Path skills, Bonus Feats and all the higher level psychic warrior class features. If you&rsquo;re a monk that&rsquo;s probably a great deal. It&rsquo;s not a great deal for every psychic warrior, but it&rsquo;s a near automatic choice if you want to do unarmed damage. You are not giving up any of your most important class features other than proficiencies. Don&rsquo;t feel locked into taking the Ascetic Path. Mind Knight, Brawler, Gladiator, and Feral Warrior are also reasonable selections here. </span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c17 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c26 c3 c24">Path</span><span class="c26 c3 c8">master</span><span class="c26 c11">UP</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c0">The pathmaster archetype&rsquo;s rating relies highly on the path you want to choose. It really wants something that is good from level 1 all the way to the end because you&rsquo;re not getting anything complementary. Ascetic and Brawler are going to be underwhelming. Interceptor and Archer could probably be happy just going all the way down this chain. Secondary paths get really good, though.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c27 c3 c0 c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0 c6">Advanced Path</span><span class="c4 c0">: You&rsquo;ll get the most out of this by getting advanced path feats that have the most frustrating prerequisites. The more underwhelming path choices for this archetype are also the paths with the advanced path feats that are hardest to get into. Archers, Interceptors and even Mind Knights can accidentally qualify for their advanced path feats. It&rsquo;s also usually worse than having a secondary path</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c24 c0">Focused</span><span class="c13 c3 c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c8 c0">Path</span><span class="c4 c0">: The better your skills are, particularly the more often they require checks in stressful situations, the better this becomes.

Free augmentation at a higher manifester level to </span><span class="c23 c0">vigor</span><span class="c0">, </span><span class="c23 c0">expansion</span><span class="c0">, </span><span class="c23 c0">inertial armor</span><span class="c0">, </span><span class="c23 c0">claws of the beast</span><span class="c4 c0">: Obviously powerful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c24 c0">Master </span><span class="c3 c0">Maneuver</span><span class="c4 c0">: Once, and later twice, per day you get to use your maneuver at a higher level without expending your psionic focus.

However, it&rsquo;s an attack and damage boost for a combat style that will be making a full attack almost every round.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0">Maneuver</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- More bonus fire damage, but you get to use your psionic focus after you successfully hit the target.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c20 c3 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c24">Thrashing Dragon</span><span class="c11">POW</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0">Powers</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- </span><span class="c0">Take </span><span class="c23 c0">metaphysical</span><span class="c23 c0">&nbsp;weapon</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;and ignore the other choice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0">Skills</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- Acrobatics will be the focus in early levels.

That is probably a good deal, but remember that you still only have one standard action, one move action, and one swift action every round. You will be a strictly worse initiator than the other Path of War classes. Those classes don&rsquo;t get the ability to manifest powers, though. Always head for the Awakened Blade</span><span class="c11 c0">POW</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;prestige class.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c0 c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c0">I&rsquo;d advise that only an experienced player and/or GM actually give this archetype a shot because the amount of tools at a single character&rsquo;s disposal could be overwhelming.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c26 c3">Protector</span><span class="c26 c11">UP</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c0">The Protector is an archetype that a psychic warrior looking to absorb damage for his teammate should consider. It takes a while to unlock the best abilities, but you&rsquo;re only trading out feats and mediocre abilities. </span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8 c0">Resilience</span><span class="c4 c0">: Trade a level 1 bonus feat for the Elan racial ability, that stacks with the Elan ability. The Elan ability is probably better than a feat, and +0 BAB at level 1 limits your combat feat choice selections anyway.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0">Swap Places</span><span class="c4 c0">: This is a nice ability, especially if you&rsquo;re stacking armor class and miss chance. However, the requirements that the ally be adjacent to you, and you expend your psionic focus will noticeably impact how often you can use it. It&rsquo;s still likely better than a feat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0">Dual Effect</span><span class="c4 c0">: When you use Swap Places or In Harm&rsquo;s Way you can use resilience. That&rsquo;s great, but Martial power is also really good. This could be better or worse for you, depending on what you&rsquo;re trying to accomplish.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8 c0">In Harm&rsquo;s Way</span><span class="c0">: Remember that you can use repletion on this before you decide to eat a </span><span class="c23 c0">cone of cold</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;for your ally. I don&rsquo;t highly rate twisting paths, so trading it out is usually going to be worthwhile.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c26 c3">Reaver</span><span class="c34 c26 c11">PA:C2</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c0">This archetype makes you more of a psionic assassin and gives you some more skill and utility options.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8 c0">Class Skills</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- Two more ranks per level and extra class skills lets you become the party skill monkey with no tradeoff.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0">Weapon and Armor Proficiencies</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- You lose medium and heavy armor and shields but get some eastern exotic weapons. This pushes you towards Dexterity a bit, but isn&rsquo;t too impactful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c3 c0">Encrypted Mind</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- You gain access to the Cryptic list as well as the Psychic Warrior list. This is a big jump in flexibility, giving you a bunch of options that aren&rsquo;t normally available. This is a straight upgrade.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c24 c0">Killer&rsquo;s Claim</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- At its base, this is not a very useful ability. Claiming enemies makes them provoke when withdrawing and lets you pinpoint them no matter the distance. The second part has some utility use, but you really need abilities that build on this. It is compatible with most of the Claim feats from Path of War Expanded. Not having a path will change how this archetype plays.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8 c0">Reaver Insights</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- These are your talents. They can be taken in place of a bonus feat.</span></p><p class="c1 c25"><span class="c3 c0 c6">Assume Pattern</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- A massive bonus on Disguise and Bluff to appear as a claimed target you&rsquo;ve killed, but it can be disbelieved with a Will save. Just pick this up as a second-level power known, the power is almost always better.</span></p><p class="c1 c25"><span class="c3 c24 c0">Bloody Instincts</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- Deal bleed damage against claimed targets. Unless you have multiple focuses and you&rsquo;re expending one to boost Killer&rsquo;s Instinct, this isn&rsquo;t that much damage. Can be good for a Vital Strike build though.</span></p><p class="c1 c25"><span class="c3 c8 c0">Cryptic Insight </span><span class="c4 c0">- A lot of these are based on traps and are not very good, but there are some nice ones, especially at high levels.</span></p><p class="c1 c25"><span class="c3 c24 c0">Mass Murdering Instinct</span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c0">- This extends the duration of your claim to 24 hours, but it&rsquo;s not clear what the duration was previously. Not that useful, but has some synergy with the tracking effect &nbsp;of claims.</span></p><p class="c1 c25"><span class="c13 c3 c0">Pattern Dislocate</span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c0">- Claimed targets get -4 on saves and CMD against your powers, class features, and maneuvers. This is a big penalty that really helps if you use combat maneuvers or anything with saves.</span></p><p class="c1 c25"><span class="c3 c0 c6">Psionic Senses</span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c0">- A bunch of abilities to help you track claimed targets, but none of them really help since you already know exactly where your claimed targets are.</span></p><p class="c1 c25"><span class="c3 c8 c0">Rogue Talents</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- A ton of options here. Most are pretty bad, but there are some gems, such as Unbalancing Trick to allow you to trip without needing Intelligence or the Akashic talents.</span></p><p class="c1 c25"><span class="c3 c8 c0">Stealth Combat Training</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- A significant bonus to four skills, this is a big help if you plan to focus on skills.</span></p><p class="c1 c25"><span class="c3 c8 c0">Trapbreaker</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- Trapfinding, the ability to open locks and disable traps without tools and Wisdom to the checks makes you very good at dealing with these obstacles.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0">Acrobatic Defense</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- A scaling bonus to AC and Reflex while focused goes a long way to make up for your lack of heavy armor. Replaces your trance, more or less.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c3 c0">Killer&rsquo;s Instinct </span><span class="c4 c0">- Scaling bonus to damage against claimed targets while focused. The damage scales pretty fast and you can expend focus to boost it on a standard action attack or vital strike. Better than the path skills it replaces.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0 c6">Reaving Euphoria</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- A few times per day, you can regain focus when dropping a claimed target. Too few uses to make up for losing your second path. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c24 c0">Corrupt Pattern</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- You can make it difficult to heal claimed targets. Doesn&rsquo;t come up much and comes online very late. A step down from Pathweaving.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0">Pattern Breaker</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- A lateral move, more or less from Eternal Warrior</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c26 c3">Shackler</span><span class="c26 c11">PA:7P</span><span class="c34 c26 c11">&nbsp;ratings by TiaC</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c0">This Archetype is pretty good at low levels if you want the Shackler path, as bonus powers are always good. At higher levels, the cost is too high to be worth it. If you plan to prestige out, this can give you a bonus power or two known.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8 c0">Ghost Road </span><span class="c4 c0">- You&rsquo;re locked into the Shackler path, so you&rsquo;re probably going for an Intimidate build. This gives you a few free powers from the Conduit discipline list in exchange for heavy armor. The Conduit list isn&rsquo;t that useful for you, being mainly effects for interaction with the dead. However there are some useful information gathering powers, powers that let you turn into an animated object or a shadow, a power that can be augmented into a resurrection effect, or a power that works like planar binding for incorporeal creatures. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0 c6">Skulls and Spirits</span><span class="c3 c24 c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">- At 9th level, 3/day, you can temporarily bind an enemy&rsquo;s spirit as a free action when you kill &nbsp;them. You get temporary HP equal to twice the enemy&rsquo;s HD, a bonus on attack and damage equal to the enemy&rsquo;s Cha modifier, and +2 deflection to AC. Unfortunately, you lose all these bonuses when you run out of temp HP or after 10 minutes. At 11th level you can bind two spirits at once for more temp HP and the attack, damage and AC bonuses from this ability increase by 1. The low uses per day and fragility of the </span><span class="c0">bonuses</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;means that this does not make up for losing your secondary path. (You keep Twisting Path and </span><span class="c0">Pathweaving</span><span class="c4 c0">, but can&rsquo;t use them.)</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c26 c3">Silhouette</span><span class="c34 c26 c11">PA:C2 ratings by TiaC</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c0">This archetype gives you a living shadow. This shadow can either be a flanker and combat helper, or you can have it do the lion&rsquo;s share of the fighting. This opens up a ton of combat styles without much effort. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c3 c0">Shadowboxing</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- This gives you a living shadow in place of your first path. The shadow cannot freely make attacks, but can attack a target you missed once per round as a free action. It has all your combat and teamwork feats and can freely take actions that don&rsquo;t require attack rolls. It wields a copy of your weapon including all magical properties. Since it has full BAB and uses your Wisdom for both its Strength and Dexterity, you can make it a better combatant than you are. Even with minimal investment, the shadow is a nice teamwork buddy, scout, and can double the effect of aura powers. If you give your shadow abilities that don&rsquo;t require attack rolls such as Dazzling Display or some weapon abilities, it can use those freely. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c0">Also worth noting is that the shadow can double-dip on a few kinds of buffs. The shadow copies all your buffs, but it also shares your size, space, reach, movement speeds, armor class, and saving throws. The ability notes that &ldquo;If an effect would add a bonus to the shadow&rsquo;s AC or saving throws, the bonus is only added once&rdquo;, however, it says nothing about size, reach or movement. Thus, if you manifest Expansion to grow two sizes to huge, the shadow starts at huge, and then grows two sizes due to the shared Expansion. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8 c0">Link</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- You can use your senses from your shadow&rsquo;s position. The shadow only has close range, but this lets it scout ahead a bit. This is generally worth your 1st-level bonus feat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c3 c0">Shadow Talents</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- These improve your shadow. You&rsquo;re required to take one at 2nd, but from then on you can take them in place of bonus feats. </span></p><p class="c1 c25"><span class="c3 c24 c0">Detonation</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- Explode your shadow for 1d6/level. It reappears next round. The untyped damage means that saving for half is the only way to reduce this. It&rsquo;s not bad for at-will blasting, but there&rsquo;s nowhere else to go with it.</span></p><p class="c1 c25"><span class="c3 c0">Far-Reaching Shadow</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- Upgrading your shadow to Medium range makes it a much better scout and can give it some more flexibility in combat.</span></p><p class="c1 c25"><span class="c3 c8 c0">Follow-up Flurry </span><span class="c4 c0">- When the shadow attacks a target you missed, it can make a second attack at -5. The extra attack makes this a much better combat buddy. The shadow&rsquo;s follow-up is especially nice with secondary natural attacks, which don&rsquo;t deal much damage, but are likely to miss due to the -5 from being secondary.</span></p><p class="c1 c25"><span class="c3 c0">Follow-up Frenzy</span><span class="c3 c8 c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c0">- Adds a third attack at -10 to Follow-up Flurry. The third attack is helpful, but -10 is a big penalty.</span></p><p class="c1 c25"><span class="c3 c0 c6">Free-Range Shadow</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- Gives the shadow long range. Helps for scouting, but medium range will usually be enough. You don&rsquo;t really want to spend two talents on this.</span></p><p class="c1 c25"><span class="c13 c3 c0">Grasping </span><span class="c3 c14 c0">Shadow</span><span class="c13 c3 c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c0">- Your shadow gets Combat Reflexes and can make Attacks of Opportunity &nbsp;freely. This is great with teamwork feats and control builds. A second zone of control is great, and feats like Paired Opportunists, Broken Wing Gambit, and Outflank can generate a ton of attacks of opportunity for the two or you. Amazing if you abuse reach stacking. </span></p><p class="c1 c25"><span class="c13 c3 c0">Limit</span><span class="c3 c14 c0">&nbsp;Break</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- Remove your shadow&rsquo;s attack restrictions for a round as a standard action. This is powerful by itself, giving you a ton of flexibility in your combat style. It also gives you the option to go Wisdom-primary to boost your shadow&rsquo;s Strength and Dexterity and make your shadow do all the attacking while being nearly SAD. It </span><span class="c0">has full</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;BAB, your weapon, and your combat feats. Meanwhile, you can keep manifesting with your move and swift actions. </span></p><p class="c1 c25"><span class="c3 c0">Perfect Double </span><span class="c4 c0">- Your shadow is a perfect copy of you, it gets a massive Disguise bonus to appear as you and you can speak through it. This confuses enemies and gives the shadow a number of utility uses. </span></p><p class="c1 c25"><span class="c3 c24 c0">Shadow </span><span class="c3 c8 c0">Consumption</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- You can transfer damage to your shadow. Since the shadow only has half your health and costs your level in power points to replace, this is generally not worth it. You can use this with Vigor to get a much bigger HP pool, especially once you add Split Shadow.</span></p><p class="c1 c25"><span class="c3 c0 c6">Share Manifestation</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- You can manifest powers from your shadow&rsquo;s space. You don&rsquo;t have great powers for this, as most of your powers are buffs, which you can share without this.</span></p><p class="c1 c25"><span class="c13 c3 c0">Share Training</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- Share another type of feat (not general) with your shadow. Feat classes like Psionic, Heritage, Conduit, or Item Mastery can give useful actions that do not require attack rolls, which can be freely used by your shadow. (Such as Ancestor&rsquo;s Breath or Unlocked Talent)</span></p><p class="c1 c25"><span class="c13 c3 c0">Split Shadow</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- You don&rsquo;t get any more actions here, but a second shadow can give you another zone of control and another copy of aura effects. </span></p><p class="c1 c25"><span class="c3 c24 c0">Recall</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- Recall your shadow as part of your refocus action. Not terrible, but you can always recall it by moving out of range if it gets stuck.</span></p><p class="c1 c25"><span class="c3 c0 c24">Transpo</span><span class="c3 c8 c0">sition</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- Move action and spen focus to swap locations is rarely worth it. If you have Perfect Double, this lets you nullify dangerous attacks and effects. Since your shadow is a construct, it will often be immune to the effect you&rsquo;re avoiding.</span></p><p class="c1 c25"><span class="c13 c3 c0">Twin</span><span class="c3 c8 c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c13 c3 c0">Blades</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- If you have multiple weapons, your shadow gets to copy two of them now and attack with both when using follow-up, turning one missed attack into two new ones. Good for two-weapon fighters, and better for natural attackers who won&rsquo;t suffer penalties for fighting with two weapons.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8 c0">Shadow Skills</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- Your shadow can use your bonus on skills. This replaces path skills at 4th and 7th, but once you get a path at 9th, you can choose between this and path skills. There are a bunch of skills this is useful with, such as Intimidate, Perception, or Acrobatics. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8 c0">Martial Power</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- You get martial power at 6th, but can&rsquo;t use it until 9th, so you get the option to swap it out for another Shadow Talent. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c0">(You still receive twisting path and pathweaving, but they have no function except to be traded out by another archetype. There&rsquo;s a lot of language in this about archetype compatibility.)</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c26 c3 c8">Thunder</span><span class="c26 c3">jarl </span><span class="c26">(Half-Giant only)</span><span class="c26 c11">UP</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This archetype is entirely built around using a two handed weapon and the </span><span class="c23 c0">stomp power</span><span class="c0">. Stomp is one of the few crowd control powers available to the psychic warrior and should be an SLA for half-giants. What you gain is actually pretty solid, unfortunately you give up both paths and your path skill and martial power. This will usually be a</span><span class="c3 c8 c0">&nbsp;good</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;choice at early levels, but will fall off at the same time </span><span class="c23 c0">stomp</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;starts to. </span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c24 c0">Psionic Weapon</span><span class="c0">/</span><span class="c3 c24 c0">Greater Psionic Weapon</span><span class="c4 c0">; The real cost here is that you give up martial power and the path powers that can be used with it. Martial Power is better than these feats even with the bonus 2d6 damage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0">Intimidate</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- Intimidate is effectively your path skill. Half Giants can be good at it, so it&rsquo;s a good pickup if you&rsquo;re going for an intimidating build.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c3 c0">Stomp</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c0">- What the entire archetype is built around. You get free full level manifestations of this power after your psi-like ability goes out of style. You gain additional ways to augment the power to make it more versatile, you can make it deal lethal damage, and you&rsquo;ll get some ways to trigger it for free. You still never gain the ability to target aerial targets and the range stays short. Definitely pick up the Improved Psi-Like Ability feat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c24 c0">Large and in Charge</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c0">- What is effectively your trance is a scaling untyped bonus to CMD. Your maneuver is turning that CMD bonus into a CMB bonus. It&rsquo;s an almost strictly worse version of the Gladiator path trance and maneuver.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8 c0">Thundering Charge</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- It&rsquo;s Martial Power for </span><span class="c23 c0">stomp</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;but only available on charge attacks. You can only use it with the </span><span class="c23 c0">stomp</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;psi-like ability, but you don&rsquo;t actually get the </span><span class="c23 c0">stomp</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;power. You get a freely scaling reflex save to knock a target prone, and it&rsquo;s not clear it actually requires the target to be on the ground like the power, but you get none of the damage. Even with feats you&rsquo;re highly limited in how often you can use this per day.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c3 c0">Thundering </span><span class="c3 c8 c0">Smash</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- Grab a Falchion and start crit fishing. By the time you get this, this is an AOE reflex save for your opponents to avoid taking 9d4 damage and fall prone every time you crit. It does start to fall off once opponents aren&rsquo;t on the ground anymore.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0">Opportunistic Stomp</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- Depending on how great your reach is, and how much dexterity you have, this could be great, particularly when combined with Thundering Smash. However, if you don&rsquo;t have combat reflexes, this will never be more than one extra attack that you might have wanted to save for something else. At worst this is an occasional free attack against a prone opponent at your full BAB.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0 c6">Empowered Strike</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- At 15th level this isn&rsquo;t likely to do much of anything. If you aren&rsquo;t already built to do combat maneuvers, CMDs will have totally outpaced your CMB. If you are built to handle combat maneuvers then just do one without expending your psionic focus. </span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c26 c3">Traceur</span><span class="c34 c26 c11">UP</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Psywars thinking of using the Mind Knight + Ascetic &nbsp;path combination should consider this as an archetype. This grants you situational bonuses for a pretty minor cost. Mobile Power is probably better than Martial Power, and the lack of armor can be somewhat negated. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0">Quickened Strides</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;There are a lot of &nbsp;popular enhancement bonuses to speed (</span><span class="c23 c0">haste</span><span class="c0">, </span><span class="c23 c0">boots of speed</span><span class="c0">, </span><span class="c23 c0">physical acceleration</span><span class="c0">), which might be better than this bonus. If you&rsquo;re getting an equivalent or better bonus from other sources, then giving up all armor proficiencies probably sucks, even if you do have highly augmented </span><span class="c23 c0">inertial armor</span><span class="c4 c0">. KKeep in mind that your other class features regardless of whether you&rsquo;re wearing armor. You can still use padded armor to stack armor enchantment bonuses onto yourself, though relying on something as fragile as padded armor is risky.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0">Charge Through</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;Gain ability to charge through difficult terrain and allies. I&rsquo;ve found a lot of GMs forget about the &ldquo;through allies&rdquo; restriction on charges anyway, but you&rsquo;re only giving up a bonus feat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0">Acrobatic Movements</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;Do not lose dexterity bonus or become flat footed when using acrobatics to move on narrow or uneven surfaces. It&rsquo;s not impressive but it&rsquo;s only replacing a +2 bonus to a skill. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c14 c0">Mobile Power</span><span class="c4 c0">: Martial power, but you can use it while physically moving instead of as part of an attack. This is Hustle Metamagic with the ability to move, without expending your psionic focus, and without the extra powerpoint cost. This will allow you turns where you manifest 3 powers in a single round. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c24 c0">Rapid Acrobatics</span><span class="c4 c0">: You move a full speed while making an acrobatics check. Often your check is so good that the movement speed isn&rsquo;t that relevant cause you&rsquo;re making it anyway. This also costs a feat.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><a id="id.b0omflqgisuq"></a><p class="c32"><span class="c7 c3">The Big Book of Feats</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 212.86px; height: 329.58px;"><img alt="" src="images/image11.png" style="width: 212.86px; height: 329.58px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c0">The Psychic Warrior is a martial character.

Only Psychic Warriors who take the Outrider path should really consider mounted combat as a style. I personally tend to view mounted combat as a superior option for archers, as it allows them to maneuver along the periphery while still making their full attacks, and ride checks are more effective for high dexterity characters. However you can get some benefit using it to cycle massive charge attacks.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c24 c0">Mounted Combat</span><span class="c11 c0">CRB</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- You should be using the outrider path, which gives your mount your AC and saving throws, and str based psywars may see their ride check struggle to hit a 10 in the early game.

This lets you get a charge and then separate again, giving you the advantage in maneuvering for a full attack.

This is absurdly good. Go ahead and skip Psionic Meditation, this lets you recover focus at no action cost to yourself. If you can get your psicrystal Psionic Meditation, such as by taking a Crystalline Creature, it can refocus twice per turn. </span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3 c8 c0">Psicrystal Strike Focus</span><span class="c3 c11 c0">(PA:PC)</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- Refocus your psicrystal weapon when you drop an enemy.

For the non-animal forms, this is best used like improved familiar to get a psicrystal that can talk and hold items, so it can activate dorjes for you. It is very unclear how this works with most of the animal forms on the list, as it mentions animal companions, but makes it clear that these aren&rsquo;t animal companions. If you use the animal companion rules, the psicrystal has undefined HD and BAB, but if you use the bestiary stats you can get a CR 8 psicrystal at level 7. I would houserule it to use animal companion rules for calculating base stats at your manifester level -3 or half your manifester level. </span></p><p class="c1 c25"><span class="c3 c24 c0">Empowered Psicrystal</span><span class="c3 c11 c0">(PA:PC)</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- Your psicrystal gains the ability to use three psi-like abilities 2/day each, chosen from one of 11 lists at half your manifester level.

It gives an initiative bonus of half your level, Alertness, and a 1/day reroll on a non-physical skill. As you level, it gives you more abilities. At 3rd level, you can borrow its sighted ability to see in darkness and magical darkness for a few minutes per day. At 5th level, you get 30&rsquo; telepathy. At 7th level, the bonus from the psicrystal&rsquo;s personality increases by 2, especially good for the personalities that give you natural armor or save bonuses, and you get +2 on will saves. At 11th level, you can shunt a mind affecting effect onto your psicrystal once per day, ignoring the effect, but suppressing your psicrystal for the duration. </span></p><p class="c1 c25"><span class="c4 c0">All in all, you get a bunch of useful bonuses from an implanted psicrystal that make it a very strong choice.</span></p><p class="c1 c25"><span class="c13 c3 c0">Psicrystal Weapon</span><span class="c3 c11 c0">(PA:PC)</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- Your psicrystal becomes an intelligent masterwork weapon that can be enchanted as normal. It gives alertness and a telepathic link as normal. At 3rd level, you gain the &nbsp;ability to teleport it back to you, this is a free action with Quick Draw, making this a very good option for throwers. Also at third level, you get the ability to deliver touch powers through it, which functions like Spellstrike, but also lets you manifest while the weapon holds the charge. This is an easy way to get extra attacks off quickened powers. At 5th level, you can spend 2 power points to have it count as a different material for penetrating DR for one minute. At 7th level, it becomes a deep crystal weapon, if it was already deep crystal, it gains an extra 1d6 damage (This is probably only supposed to apply to the damage when you charge the deep crystal, but it doesn&rsquo;t actually say that.) &nbsp;Because of this, I recommend using a deep crystal weapon for your psicrystal, as the extra damage is quite nice. At 9th level, you can expend you focus to make the weapon reduce the target&rsquo;s energy resistance with every hit. At 13th level, this can reduce PR instead. It keeps Power Resistance and Sight Link from the base Psicrystal. At 15th level, you can expend focus to deal energy damage with the weapon for a round. This offers a host of benefits that are well worth the feat &nbsp;for &nbsp;a psychic warrior. It is especially good for throwing characters. </span></p><p class="c1 c9 c12"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c36 c29 c22 c3">Psionic Manifesting Feats</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c24 c0">Access Psionic Talent</span><span class="c11 c0">UP</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- The ability to grab from 5 power from *any* class&rsquo;s list is great.

The real problem this has is that most of your Psychometabolism powers are buffs, and most of your Telepathy powers are debuffs or attacks, so you will rarely want to target the same creature with both.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0">Unconditional Power</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- 8 power points is probably exorbitant, but you gain the ability to manifest your very good personal only powers while in some of the worst conditions that can befall you</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c29 c3">Animus Feats</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c24 c0">Animus Potency</span><span class="c11 c0">PA:C2</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- This lets you theoretically overchannel augmentations, but only to boost saving throws.

You are able to power well past what most other resistance bonuses will give you at higher levels.

This does augment more efficiently, but CMD also typically scales more harshly than AC does.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0 c6">Prescience, Offensive</span><span class="c0 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">- &nbsp;Manifest </span><span class="c23 c0">offensive precognition </span><span class="c4 c0">and use power attack or piranha strike for the same or better results.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c24 c0">Prevenom</span><span class="c0">/</span><span class="c3 c24 c0">Prevenom</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c24 c0">Weapon</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- This would rate much more highly if you could augment the power to increase the saving throw or even inefficiently increase the Con damage of the poison. As is, it&rsquo;s an easy saving throw for minor damage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0 c6">Shield Wall</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- Unless you&rsquo;re using a tower shield, I don&rsquo;t see the justification for using this and not </span><span class="c23 c0">force screen</span><span class="c4 c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8 c0">Skate</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- This does allow you to buff your allies, and it&rsquo;s a mostly untyped speed bonus so it stacks, but it also doesn&rsquo;t scale well over time. It&rsquo;s still a very solid mobility power, though. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8 c0">Stomp</span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c0">- The only area control spell available to you at level 1. Ignore the nonlethal damage, it&rsquo;s just a bonus on top of everything in front of you being prone. It does augment to increase the save DC, but never gains the ability to target air-born targets.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0">Synesthete</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- Very cool fluff, and also useful, but you have too few powers known to justify taking this. Worthy of a power stone, though.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8 c0">Thicken Skin</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- Natural armor can be expensive to get through magical items. This also stacks with all of your other defensive powers. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c3 c0">Vigor</span><span class="c13 c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">- This power will be good for every psychic warrior from </span><span class="c0">level 1</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;all the way to 20. The share pain/psicrystal combo pushes it over the top, but you don&rsquo;t need that to justify efficient temporary hit points for a frontline character.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c32"><span class="c26 c3">2nd-Level</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0">Ablative Armor</span><span class="c11 c0">PA:C2</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- Spend 3 points to add 2 AC to your armor suit, instead of 4 points with </span><span class="c23 c0">inertial armor</span><span class="c4 c0">, It also bypasses the golden rule because it&rsquo;s a separate power, so you can get +7 inertial armor at level 3.. The duration is good, but not not hours per level, the power augments poorly, and the bonus disappears as you take hits.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8 c0">Animal Affinity</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- </span><span class="c23 c0">Bull&rsquo;s Strength </span><span class="c0">/</span><span class="c23 c0">&nbsp;Bear&rsquo;s Endurance </span><span class="c0">/</span><span class="c23 c0">&nbsp;Cat&rsquo;s Grace </span><span class="c0">/</span><span class="c0 c23">&nbsp;Eagle&rsquo;s Splendor </span><span class="c0">/</span><span class="c23 c0">&nbsp;Fox&rsquo;s Cunning </span><span class="c0">/</span><span class="c23 c0">&nbsp;Owl&rsquo;s Wisdom </span><span class="c4 c0">all wrapped into one power.

Archers don&rsquo;t need it at all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c24 c0">Body Purification</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- Ability damage sucks, but so does having this take up a power slot. Use a dorje for this</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c3 c0">Concealing Amorpha</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">-</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;This is </span><span class="c23 c0">blur</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c0">that isn&rsquo;t bypassed like Illusions.This will become an important way to put additional defenses on top of your armor class as you advance into later levels</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0 c6">Dead</span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c24 c0">Hand</span><span class="c11 c0">PA:7P</span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">- Turning one of your hands ethereal is pretty situational, so this is pretty bad. However, it&rsquo;s a bit better for grapplers, as you can force a will save or become shaken against anyone you grapple. Its short duration means that it still isn&rsquo;t too good for grapplers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0 c6">Deflect</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- Giving up an immediate/swift action, 3 power points, and a power known to deflect one ranged attack is not worth it</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c24 c0">Defy</span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c13 c3 c0">Gravity</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- This is a </span><span class="c13 c3 c0">good</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;choice for archers who can use it to move themselves to a safe spot and hang out. The move action cost will make this </span><span class="c3 c24 c0">problematic</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;for characters who need to dance in melee. It still has out of combat value for both types.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8 c0">Detect Hostile Intent</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- I&rsquo;m not really sure how to rate this for Psychic Warriors. You&rsquo;ll definitely get use out of this power, particularly in dungeons or social situations. I love this as a dorje, but I&rsquo;m a little cooler on it taking up a powers known slot.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8 c0">Dimension Swap</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- The standard action manifesting time is a big limitation for what would otherwise be a great power for psychic warriors. Ideally you&rsquo;d have another manifester who can cast this on you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0 c6">Dissolving Touch</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- Likely to end up as less damage than attacking someone. You can take feats to make those touch attacks, too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c24 c0">Dissolving Weapon</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">-</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;Unlike Dissolving Touch, you can use this to stack a bunch of damage onto a weapon hours or days before you attack with it. It&rsquo;s still pretty bad as a power known.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c24 c0">Distracting Strikes</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- It&rsquo;s a guaranteed minor debuff, but it&rsquo;s a very minor debuff</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8 c0">Ectoplasmic Charged Armor</span><span class="c11 c0">PA:C2</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- Enemies take damage every time they attack you, though it will often quickly round down to 1d6 damage that&rsquo;s still solid. It can be augmented to be more potent longer and grant a tiny bit of temp HP as well..</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c24 c0">Empathic Transfer</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- Body adjustment or a proactive Vigor+Share Pain with expanded knowledge is going to do more to help your allies than this reactionary measure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0">Endorphin Surge</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- You gain barbarian rage for a few rounds every time you manifest this, and one of those rounds will be used manifesting this. Augments poorly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8 c0">Energy Adaptation, Specified</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- A rare psionic power with an effect that automatically scales, you can augment it to manifest as an immediate power. At high levels, you&rsquo;ll want this or </span><span class="c23 c0">energy adaptation</span><span class="c4 c0">. You don&rsquo;t need both, though.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c3 c0">Entangling Strike</span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c0">- Entangling an enemy for a round would be solid, but you also get to trigger more free damage if they try to make a concentration check. Proactive/reactive swift action manifesting and no saving throw or power resistance pushes this all the way to great</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c24 c0">Ephemeral Bolt</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- This has a lot of very niche uses, particularly for delivering poisons. It has so much setup with it&rsquo;s manifesting time it&rsquo;s basically an out of combat power though.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0 c6">Epidermal Fissure</span><span class="c11 c0">PA:C2</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- Either you cause bleed damage to an enemy by buffing them, or you force an ally to make a fortitude check to receive a strength bonus and also take bleed damage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0">Everyman</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- A big skill boost to an opposed check, with a big duration, and the ability to bypass scent. The fact that you aren&rsquo;t changing your clothes at all means it&rsquo;s only support for a character who disguises themselves rather than a tool to make anyone competent at that. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0 c6">Feat</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c24 c0">Leech</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- </span><span class="c3 c0 c6">Useless</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in a campaign without psionic enemies. Even if there are, it&rsquo;s rare for you to know what the enemy&rsquo;s feats are and for them to be so good that you qualify to take them and are worth stealing. It will be great when it does work, but probably won&rsquo;t work that often.This could go all the way up to </span><span class="c3 c0">average</span><span class="c0">, if your GM is forthcoming about that information.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0 c6">Freezing Sting</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- I don&rsquo;t see many worlds where you take this over </span><span class="c23 c0">distracting strikes</span><span class="c4 c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c24 c0">Heightened Vision</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- </span><span class="c23 c0">Darkvision</span><span class="c4 c0">. There are better uses for a power&rsquo;s known slot.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c3 c0">Hustle</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- Converting a swift action into a move action is powerful, but you need to be judicious about how often you use this. Also useful for characters who would like the Spring Attack feat but not its terrible prerequisites. &nbsp;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0 c6">Painful Strike</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">-</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;You&rsquo;re likely to gain far more by just augmenting your natural attack powers than manifesting this. It does apply to all of your natural attacks for relatively few power points, but its duration is terrible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0">Prowess</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- If you&rsquo;re a character that can make heavy use of AOOs and don&rsquo;t yet have Combat Reflexes, this will give a little bit of value. Even still, you&rsquo;re going to want to get rid of this with retraining or </span><span class="c23 c0">psychic reformation</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;later on.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8 c0">Proximity Strike</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- No saving throw is nice, but the close range can be limiting. Still a useful way to make sure you stay on top of slippery targets</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8 c0">Psionic Lion&rsquo;s Charge</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- Early in the game, </span><span class="c23 c0">hustle </span><span class="c0">will do more than this. As the game gets to later levels, your buffs and number of attacks increase this becomes a </span><span class="c13 c3 c0">great</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;power. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c24 c0">Psionic </span><span class="c13 c3 c0">Scent</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- This is a </span><span class="c3 c0 c13">great</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;power for any kind of scouting character, but will have very</span><span class="c3 c24 c0">&nbsp;limited utility</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;for anyone else. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0">Repositioning </span><span class="c3 c8 c0">Strike</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- Flanking is a nice benefit, though it usually isn&rsquo;t that hard to generate flanking. This gets </span><span class="c3 c8 c0">better</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;if you or an ally have abilities like Sneak Attack that activate off of flanking.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c24 c0">Shocking Strike</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- The best bonus damage option of the </span><span class="c23 c0">X strike</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;line of powers, and thus the most underwhelming.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c24 c0">Sidestep</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- Still not quite worth it because of the powers known slot, this is much bette that the </span><span class="c23 c0">deflect</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">power because massive single melee attack enemies are common and dangerous. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c24 c0">Sonic</span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c8 c0">Blast</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- Sonic damage is nice because it&rsquo;s rare for enemies to resist it, but you need to be a proficient tripper for this to be a good power</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0 c6">Steal Animus</span><span class="c11 c0">PA:C2</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- Spend 3 power points to steal 1d4 animus, which you can then use as 1d4 power points, but only if you target has animus</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8 c0">Strength of My Enemy</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">-</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Attack your enemy and drain them of strength while gaining an enhancement bonus to your own. </span><span class="c3 c24 c0">Bad</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;for natural weapon users or TWF style fighters because it only applies to one weapon. Possibly great for archers who have an </span><span class="c23 c0">adaptive</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;(Ultimate Equipment) composite bow as they can most reliably make a large number of draining attacks each round.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c24 c0">Sustenance</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- This is the situationally useful Elan racial ability, but costing 3 times as much and uses a power known slot. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c3 c0">Sympathetic Drain</span><span class="c11 c0">PA:C2</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- This actually has a ton of power if you have a healer in your party or are dealing with an opponent that is likely to have less hit points than you. Point at them and drain more than half of their hit points away with no save. It&rsquo;s a very risky power to use, but it does give you the option to point at things and just kill them without allowing a save. It becomes much better if you buy a Surge Crystal</span><span class="c11 c0">UP</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;to get the surge augment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0 c6">Telekinetic Bola</span><span class="c11 c0">PA:C2</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- There are cheaper powers that provide more defense and cheaper powers that provide more damage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0 c6">Thought Shield</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- </span><span class="c23 c0">empty mind</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;costs fewer power points, doesn&rsquo;t require you to gamble on whether you&rsquo;re dealing with a mind-affecting power or spell, and scales about as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0 c6">Transfer Animus</span><span class="c11 c0">PA:C2</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- A power that just let you transfer power points would not be highly regarded, and animus is less frequently useful by teammates than power points are. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c24 c0">Wall Walker</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- This will become how you bypass climb checks, but not as a power known. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8 c0">Wintry Grasp</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- This becomes </span><span class="c13 c3 c0">great</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;if you have Unavoidable Strike or Deep Impact to make the attack a touch attack.The cold damage on the other side is more of a mixed bag. Stopping someone from moving is just great, though.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c32"><span class="c26 c3">3rd-Level Psychic Warrior Powers</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0">Biokinetic Endurance</span><span class="c11 c0">PA:C2</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- Ability damage isn&rsquo;t a common enough concern that you want this as a power known, but you absolutely want to have it as a tattoo because simply negating con or strength damage will save your life.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c24 c0">Caustic Retribution</span><span class="c11 c0">PA:C2</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- Give yourself or an ally xenomorph blood. It&rsquo;s not really very good but it&rsquo;s so metal. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0 c6">Charge Weapon</span><span class="c11 c0">(PA:F&amp;P)</span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c0">- Low single target damage isn&rsquo;t really worth it, and the additional effects are too minor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8 c0">Claws of the Vampire</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- The healing just isn&rsquo;t likely to be all of that much, depending on how much you boosted </span><span class="c23 c0">claws of the beast</span><span class="c4 c0">. 5 healing on each hit is generous for when you first get the power. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c24 c0">Cloned Twin</span><span class="c11 c0">PA:C2</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- At a certain point this becomes an early get out of death free card, letting you augment this so that you can shift to the clone body when you die. Before that point, it&rsquo;s not clear what the power is useful for as it&rsquo;s not clear whether you have a psychic link with the clone or get any information it receives when it disappears.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0">Cold of the Grave</span><span class="c11 c0">PA:7P</span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">- Immunities to pain and emotion effects and selective immunity to morale effects is useful to protect you from fear and other less common conditions. DR 2 against mental ability damage won&rsquo;t come up much, but there&rsquo;s few other ways &nbsp;of getting the effect. Not worth it when you first get 3rd-level powers, but immunities are more important at high levels, so it can be </span><span class="c3 c0">decent</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;at higher levels &nbsp;and the duration augment makes it fire and forget.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8 c0">Concealing Amorpha, Greater</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">-</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Total concealment is powerful, but the round/level duration limits it until manifester level 10 or more. There will still be times where you&rsquo;d rather manifest regular </span><span class="c23 c0">concealing amorpha</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;before a fight but a minute is usually enough time for the power to have been worth manifesting.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0">Danger Sense</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- Useful for scouting psychic warriors, or whenever you&rsquo;re about to enter a kobold lair.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8 c0">Dimension Slide</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- This will often be worse than </span><span class="c23 c0">dimension swap</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;until you can afford to augment it so that it manifests as a move action. After that it&rsquo;s a short range </span><span class="c23 c0">fold space</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;that allows you to still act after manifesting it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0">Dispatch</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- Big bonuses to trip are nice, but you also shouldn&rsquo;t need them if you&rsquo;re dedicated to tripping enemies already. It&rsquo;s a little extravagant to try and fit this onto a tripping build</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0 c6">Duodimensional Claw </span><span class="c4 c0">- Don&rsquo;t take this as a power known. Take the Improved Critical feat or get a power stone</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0">Ectoplasmic Form</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- Losing your physical attacks as it becomes harder to manifest powers sucks quite a bit. There&rsquo;s still quite a bit of utility here, particularly for psychic warriors trying to get where they don&rsquo;t belong.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0">Ectoplasmic Grapnel</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- There&rsquo;s some utility for bypassing objects and closing the distance with enemies, but you already should have multiple powers or feats or allies that can help you do this. Those other powers don&rsquo;t have 8 paragraphs of text that your GM will hate reading.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c24 c0">Empathic Feedback</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- This does have a very good duration, but the damage reflected in minor, has to pass a will save to get through at all, is mind affecting, and doesn&rsquo;t stop the damage from getting to you in the first place. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0">Empathic Transfer, Hostile</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- This should range from 25 damage/healing to 70 damage/healing, not accounting for the potential of it being AOE damage. It is mind affecting, but I think this is clearly better than empathic feedback.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0 c6">Escape Detection</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- The DC capping at 23 means there&rsquo;s a limit how good the power can be, even from a power stone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0 c6">Evade Burst</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- Spend 5 power points to get evasion against on one reflex save. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0 c6">Exhalation of the Black Dragon</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- ranged version of the cantrip </span><span class="c23 c0">corrosive touch</span><span class="c0">, as a third level power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0">Expose Weakness</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- If you have sneak attack or a rogue teammate, they&rsquo;ll be happy with you, but otherwise don&rsquo;t bother</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c14 c0">Form Astral Armor</span><span class="c11 c0">PA:C2</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- Aegis is a pretty strong class, and this makes their main ability into a single power known. The bonus customizations scale without augmentation, but the ability to pick customizations as an aegis of your manifester level is what makes this amazing. Some standouts are Flight, Powerful Build, Tremorsense, Blindsense, Burrow, Improved Evasion/Stalwart, the akashic customizations, and Initiator&rsquo;s soul. This doesn&rsquo;t totally replace </span><span class="c23 c0">metamorphosis</span><span class="c0">, but rather can complement it, with each doing some things more effectively than the other. This may also take more time at the table to pick out customizations that </span><span class="c23 c0">metamorphosis</span><span class="c4 c0">, so do prep work to prevent annoying the GM or fellow players.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c24 c0">Fracture Pattern</span><span class="c11 c0">PA:C2</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- Fort negates is incredibly rough for a class that will typically have poor saving throws. This could be a powerful debuff in a party with a bunch of a similar damage type, but it&rsquo;s probably best left to a 9 level manifester to handle that. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0 c6">Graft Armor</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- Don&rsquo;t wear armor that you need this power to get the most out of.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0 c6">Graft Weapon</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- Don&rsquo;t make the mistake of learning </span><span class="c23 c0">duodimensional claw</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;without already knowing </span><span class="c23 c0">claws of the beast</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;so that you don&rsquo;t have to learn this power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0 c6">Mental </span><span class="c3 c0">Barrier</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- If you&rsquo;re willing to augment this to increase the duration, it can become </span><span class="c3 c0">decent</span><span class="c4 c0">. You probably won&rsquo;t have the powerpoints to spare on that, so it&rsquo;s likely safe to skip. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8 c0">Moan of the Sorrowful Dead</span><span class="c11 c0">PA:7P</span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">- AoE save or frighten with medium range is the sort of crowd control that doesn&rsquo;t really exist elsewhere on your list, so this is a useful bit of variety.

It&rsquo;s offensive mode is very comparable to </span><span class="c23 c0">corrosive aura</span><span class="c4 c0">, with a similar amount of guaranteed damage and a wider area of effect but a saving throw that doesn&rsquo;t scale.

You probably don&rsquo;t have much Charisma though, so you should avoid this. If you cheese it with healing powers and 14+ Cha, this is </span><span class="c13 c3 c0">great</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;when augmented, otherwise it&rsquo;s </span><span class="c3 c0 c6">terrible</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c24 c0">Shrapnel Burst</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- It&rsquo;s solid AOE damage if you can get yourself among a bunch of enemies, but you&rsquo;re likely to struggle to do that while getting away from your allies. You&rsquo;ll probably get more damage out of </span><span class="c23 c0">kyria&rsquo;s crystalline aura</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0">Slip the Bonds</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- Not every psychic warrior will want </span><span class="c23 c0">freedom of movement</span><span class="c4 c0">, but some (archers, assassins) probably will at some point. Also has some use if you expect underwater combat. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8 c0">Steadfast Perception</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- A weaker version of </span><span class="c23 c0">pierce the veils</span><span class="c4 c0">, but this will still let you get around a lot of combat illusion defenses.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0 c6">Tactile Telekinesis</span><span class="c11 c0">PA:C2</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- Grants you bonuses to strength, but only for the purpose of carrying capacity, a slight bonus to attack and damage, and the rock throwing ability (bestiary 6 page 298). </span><span class="c23 c0">Battle transformation</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;is available at this level. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c3 c0">Thundering Step</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- At this point you should have plenty of ways to a make single melee attack a reliable hit, the possible crowd control after this is all a bonus</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c24 c0">Truevenom</span><span class="c0">/</span><span class="c3 c24 c0">Truevenom Weapon</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- With your low saving throw DCs, there are a lot of worlds where this will do the same amount of Con damage as </span><span class="c23 c0">prevenom</span><span class="c0">.

It&rsquo;s probably not worth the power known slot, though.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8 c0">Zealous Fury</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- Particularly for two-weapon fighters and archers who will be doubling up on this bonus. Less so for characters who already expect to be making a lot of use of powers like </span><span class="c23 c0">hustle</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c23 c0">psionic lion&rsquo;s charge</span><span class="c4 c0">. </span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c32"><span class="c26 c3">5th-Level Psychic Warrior Powers</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0">Adapt Body</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- A nice, long duration get out of jail free card for moving through the elemental planes and their environmental hazards.

Archery&rsquo;s strength is putting a mass of attacks on one target, not spreading a bunch of small attacks all over the place. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8 c0">Biting Cold </span><span class="c4 c0">- No save paralysis if your opponent tries to do anything that matters is really good, though at this point power resistance and spell resistance are really starting to crop up and you&rsquo;ll have more trouble getting through them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0">Bonding Strike</span><span class="c3 c8 c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">- The more reach you have, and the more single target/less AOE damage you have the party, the better this power becomes.

It&rsquo;s best use will be if you&rsquo;re a frontliner and you can get far enough away from any other psionic characters in your own party. It still won&rsquo;t be great.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0 c6">Meta</span><span class="c3 c24 c0">concert</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- It requires there being another manifester in the party, ideally multiple. If you do have multiple manifesters in the party, it should be left to the telepath psion to know this power. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8 c0">Oak Body</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- You gain immunity to a ton of really nasty status effects, and some spells and powers that mess with you otherwise.

You&rsquo;ve already dumped all your less important stats for the more important ones in character creation. There&rsquo;s only so much lower they can go. Besides that, it&rsquo;s not fun to instantly get knocked unconscious by a single </span><span class="c23 c0">ego whip</span><span class="c0">, or </span><span class="c23 c0">touch of idiocy</span><span class="c4 c0">. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c24 c0">Summoning Strike</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- You can spend two more points to use </span><span class="c23 c0">dimension slide</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;to just teleport yourself next to an enemy and full attack them without them making a will save.

Manifester levels are a little less precious for you than they are a full manifester like a psion or wilder. You have meaningful class abilities, but many of them at higher levels are just more raw number increases, so they can sometimes be made up with a better chassis and more versatile class abilities. You&rsquo;d love to get a D10 HD, full BAB or better base saving throws if you could, but they aren&rsquo;t necessary. Just try not to take a step backwards in those areas</span></p><p class="c32 c9"><span class="c7 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c24">Adaptive Warrior</span><span class="c11">UP</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c0">The Adaptive Warrior has some nice chassis improvements for you with a D10 HD, full BAB, and better reflex save, but costs some skill points. It&rsquo;s feat prerequisites aren&rsquo;t ideal and the best class features are Accelerated Combat at level 6 and Extended Memory at level 7, which comes after you&rsquo;ve given up two manifester levels. A lot of the class is built around getting a competence bonus that isn&rsquo;t likely to stack with your trance bonus. </span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Awakened</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c14">Blade</span><span class="c34 c22 c11">POW </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;Entry into this is awkward for most psychic warriors. They either have a choice of spending some more feats on the martial training chain to gain second level maneuvers or multiclassing and giving up three levels to gain maneuvers. The prestige class already sacrifices two manifester levels, so I&rsquo;d recommend just going with the feats. You do get good abilities out of it, but the price may be too steep for some to pay. On the other hand, any psychic warrior who is using the Pathwalker archetype should pretty much </span><span class="c3 c14 c0">always go</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;for this prestige class. </span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c17 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8">Dark Tempest</span><span class="c22 c11 c34">UP</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c0">Though better for soulknifes than psychic warrior, there&rsquo;s still little entry for psychic warriors, particularly mind knights.You lose one manifester level multi-classing into soulknife and trade 2 skill points per level for a d10HD. I can&rsquo;t say exactly what kind of psychic warrior goes into this, but it&rsquo;s unlikely to be a bad choice. You gain some powers known, and don&rsquo;t lose soulknife class feature or psychic warrior manifester progression.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c6">Elocater</span><span class="c11">UP</span><span class="c4 c22">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c0">I&rsquo;m probably not giving this a fair shake, but you give up three manifester levels and have to take dodge, mobility, and spring attack. </span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c24">Metamorph</span><span class="c11">UP</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s not actually that unreasonable to qualify for this, as </span><span class="c23 c0">metamorphosis</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is already high on most psychic warriors&rsquo; lists for Expanded Knowledge choices.

Handbooks are typically written for players, and not the GMs who need a campaign that can survive encounters with the players. The least we can do is give GMs some quick advice on common issues psychic warriors can bring up. GM&rsquo;s should also check out the section on </span><span class="c29 c13 c0"><a class="c19" href="#id.qwv911envyny">general psionics concepts</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;found earlier in this guide.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c17 c3">Archetypes, Feats, Powers, or Prestige Classes</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c0">This is simply a section of options available to Psychic Warriors that GMs should be highly aware of. Sometimes that may mean banning the option entirely, but usually it means having an out of session conversation with a player about that option and setting ground rules.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0">Archetypes</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pathwalker</span><span class="c11 c0">POW</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- As mentioned in that archetype&rsquo;s section, the archetype just has a massive number of moving pieces. It forces the GM and player to track and manage two different ability subsystems. If you can&rsquo;t track both or don&rsquo;t trust the player to track both, it&rsquo;s probably best to just ban it.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0">Feats</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bound Sigil</span><span class="c11 c0">PA:F&amp;P</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- As mentioned earlier in the handbook, this lets psychic warriors completely break the resource barrier for themselves and potentially their party mates.

You probably shouldn&rsquo;t ban these, but work together to find a way that will make tracking them easier if your player will be making use of them.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c23 c0">form astral armor</span><span class="c11 c0">PA:C2</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- If you have an Aegis in the party, it can suck that a psychic warrior gets a huge swath of their class defining ability from a level 3 power. It could also end up taking massive amounts of table time as a player hunts down customizations from multiple source books.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c23 c0">psychic reformation</span><span class="c11 c0">UP</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- If you aren&rsquo;t limiting downtime or putting a time crunch on the characters, this can lead to a character that you&rsquo;ll need to relearn once every session, if not more. It can also eat up massive amounts of table time if you think the player will make heavy use of it. Remember that psionic characters don&rsquo;t get to naturally swap spells like sorcerers or bards. As troublesome as it may be, its existence can be key to the system.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c23 c0">sympathetic drain</span><span class="c11 c0">PA:C2</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- I would strongly consider banning this. It actually isn&rsquo;t likely to break combats or encounters. However, when it does break them, it will do so in a very unengaging way.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c23 c0">vigor</span><span class="c11 c0">UP</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- Proactively applied temp HP can make it seem like your player is unkillable by damage, especially with the psicrystal+</span><span class="c23 c0">share pain</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;combination. This is partly a Nova and partly a prep-time issue. Make psychic warriors use their resources with multiple combats and try to target them in ways besides hp damage.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0">Prestige Classes</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Phrenic Slayer</span><span class="c11 c0">UP</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;- This is a prestige class that can have the same problems that a ranger does, but more so. Rangers get multiple favored enemies while the Phrenic slayer only gets one, and it has to be a psionic enemy. Also they have to kill that psionic enemy before a character can take levels in the class. If your player shows interest in this prestige class ahead of a game, you may need to tweak your campaign or tell them to do something else.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Source Material that they should to familiarize yourself with</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c0">Core Rulebook/Advanced Player&rsquo;s Guide: Obviously.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c0">Ultimate Combat/Ultimate Equipment: Like any martial character, Psychic Warriors will commonly be digging through these.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c0">Ultimate Psionics (alternatively Psionics Unleashed &amp; Psionics Expanded): This is where you&rsquo;re going to find Psychic Warriors and many of the key options for that class.
