thread</a></span><span class="c24 c42">)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">The Cryptic is the Psionic answer to the Rogue, as introduced in Dreamscarred Press&rsquo; Psionics line. An agile and highly adaptable scout and skirmisher, the Cryptic is almost unparalleled in dealing out nasty debuffs and performing sabotage. In addition, it gets a highly versatile list of powers and skills that can make it even more adaptable.</span></p><p class="c13"><span>On the downside, the damage output of the Cryptic is generally not the best and if things go bad, it is not a particularly durable class to be playing</span><span>.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">On the whole, I would say that the Cryptic lands in a good spot in Tier 3 and as such is a highly valuable addition to the party.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">I will be using the now somewhat standard colour system for rating in this guide, but for those who are unfamiliar, here is how the colour coding works:</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c4 c8">Purple</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">- Really good. You&rsquo;ll usually want to take this or at least think hard before you don&rsquo;t. Purple archetypes are build-definers.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c10 c4">Blue</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">- A good option. All of these are solid choices that you could definitely do worse than taking. Blue archetypes tend to be an upgrade for the builds that want them.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">Green</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;- Decent, but not great, these options are somewhat more situational but can still shine. When it comes to Archetypes, green means an even trade.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c4 c5">Yellow</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">- A bit naff, for whatever reason. Generally you will want to avoid such options, but certain builds will still get good use out of some of these. Skip unless you have a good reason.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c4 c6">Red</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;- The crapmasters. These are options that just plain suck. You will basically never want to take these outside of VERY specific builds.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c11 c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c11 c4"></span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c4 c19">Index</span></p><p class="c13 c31"><span class="c12"><a class="c21" href="#h.nitgfnx572a7">Class Chassis</a></span></p><p class="c13 c31"><span class="c12"><a class="c21" href="#h.xyufib9j6n76">Attributes</a></span></p><p class="c13 c31"><span class="c12"><a class="c21" href="#h.dk1g1o8hb57p">Races</a></span></p><p class="c13 c31"><span class="c12"><a class="c21" href="#h.nzpl31mshwpr">Class Features</a></span></p><p class="c13 c31"><span class="c12"><a class="c21" href="#h.l54en27730vt">Powers</a></span></p><p class="c13 c31"><span class="c12"><a class="c21" href="#h.fjrc8upgqqac">Archetypes</a></span></p><p class="c13 c31"><span class="c12"><a class="c21" href="#h.y0zfqliklgcv">Feats and Traits (need feedback/suggestions)</a></span></p><p class="c13 c31"><span class="c12"><a class="c21" href="#h.pfdxsoiqxjho">Equipment (ongoing)</a></span></p><p class="c13 c31"><span class="c12"><a class="c21" href="#h.nzqqq3hbzleq">Multiclassing, Prestige Classes and Gestalt (Not done yet)</a></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c16 c38" id="h.xtb0z27sfx02"><span class="c19 c4"></span></h2><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h2 class="c16 c38" id="h.q0ewfr3dxkpd"><span class="c19 c4"></span></h2><h2 class="c16" id="h.nitgfnx572a7"><span class="c19 c4">Class Chassis</span></h2><p class="c13"><span>The Cryptic gets only a basic set of proficiencies, though with some specific additions. They are proficient with all </span><span class="c0">Simple Weapons, the Shortbow and the Rapier</span><span>. For armour, they only get </span><span class="c4 c39">Light Armour and no Shields</span><span>. A </span><span class="c0">d8</span><span>&nbsp;hit dice leaves you with only a basic amount of HP to work with, but it could definitely be worse, while a </span><span class="c4 c5">Mid BAB</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;will afford you just enough accuracy to do your job, if only just.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span>For Skills, however, you are a pro. </span><span class="c0">4+Int</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;may not seem like much, but remember you are heavily Int based, so this will grow quickly. In addition you get a lot of class skills to work with including some of the best.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span>Your saves are pretty good, with </span><span class="c0">Reflex</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c10 c4">Will</span><span>&nbsp;as your good saves. Just be careful of Poison and the like, because your</span><span class="c4 c5">&nbsp;Fort</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;could definitely stand to be better.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c25" id="h.xyufib9j6n76"><span class="c19 c4">Attributes</span></h2><p class="c13"><span class="c4 c5">Stren</span><span class="c10 c4">gth:</span><span>&nbsp;You are unlikely to be wanting too much in Strength as you can do little with it; it doesn&rsquo;t help your skills too much, you don&rsquo;t have the proficiencies for it and you are going to have other priorities. That said, there are builds that can really make this work, so if you are </span><span>looking</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;at being an up-front style of Cryptic, then this will become more favourable.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c10 c4">Dext</span><span class="c0">erity</span><span class="c0">:</span><span>&nbsp;Your primary attack stat is going to be Dex in all but the most niche builds. You are also going to want it to shore up the little AC your Light armour gives you. Obviously, if you are going with a Str build, then this gets less important</span><span>.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">Constitution:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;You are going to want a bit of this, but you may not have room for too much of it. It would be better to just avoid being in situations where you will be needing the HP and Fort. Str builds are going to want a bit more of this than others.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c4 c5">Wisdom:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;It does key a few really good skills, but you have ways to deal with that. Don&rsquo;t dump it outright as you never want a penalty to Will, but don&rsquo;t feel the need to boost it at the expense of the other things. If you can, make sure to get a 13 in this as you will very likely want Psionic Meditation for your Focus needs, but any more will be superfluous.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c4 c8">Intelligence:</span><span>&nbsp;Your most important stat will help you with your important skill roles but most importantly enhance your Manifesting. It also is the stat your class features will be working off, so make sure this thing is as high as you can get it without going </span><span>crazytown</span><span class="c1">. A 17-18 pre-racial will want to go here in higher point-buy games, but lower or Str builds can settle on a 16.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c4 c6">Charisma:</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Charisma is your dump stat in real terms; it does nothing for you that you can&rsquo;t easily replace and you will often have other jobs to do than be the face. Plus, you&rsquo;re covered in tatts, so people will think you look dodgy anyway.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">From this, we can identify the main standout builds.</span></p><ul class="c18 lst-kix_ptdyzjvb012-0 start"><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Ranged/skirmish Cryptics are going to want to focus mostly on Int first and Dex after that. Everything else takes back seat</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">TWF builds are going to want to get more Dex to shore up their accuracy, so they are going to want to keep Int and Dex somewhat equal priority. To make this work, you want to be a Brutal Disrupter or have Pattern Breaker&rsquo;s Gloves.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Strength builds are going to be built around utilising the Brutal Disrupter archetype or Pattern Breaker&rsquo;s Gloves. Their stat priorities are going to want to have Str and Int as equals, but are going to want to put more thought into Con due to the loss of defence from Dex.</span></li></ul><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c25 c38" id="h.t5rc13l3diwv"><span class="c19 c4"></span></h2><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h2 class="c25 c38" id="h.wua63kh7yepv"><span class="c19 c4"></span></h2><h2 class="c25" id="h.dk1g1o8hb57p"><span class="c19 c4">Races</span></h2><p class="c13"><span class="c1">There are lots of races to choose from in Pathfinder and they can often make or break your build or concept. As such you are going to want to think carefully about what race you want to pick. I&rsquo;m not listing all of the races here, but for races I don&rsquo;t mention or ones you homebrew, the biggest boon you want is a +2 Int. With that, nearly anything can make a good Cryptic, but there are more things to note such as Natural Weapons, Feat support and being Psionic.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c4">Psionic Races:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Being a Psionic class, of particular note are the Psionic races, which will give you an extra 2 PP and the option of a PP as a FCB.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c4 c8">Blues:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;The Psionic goblin has stats in all the right places and racial features that suit you to a tee. Definitely a good choice, the Blue is very well suited to this job. Take special note of the Psionic Prodigy alternate trait, which will give you more PP and a 1st lvl power from ANY list.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">Dromites:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Dromites don&rsquo;t really have stats that suit most Cryptics, but you could do worse if you wanted to go Social. Their Racials aren&rsquo;t too bad either, but there is better. Oddly, they get their own Archetype for Cryptic, which I will note later along with ways to try to poach it.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">Duergars:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Duergars aren&rsquo;t too good at this job, with stats that don&rsquo;t help too much and little else to help you. Nothing that actively works against you, but nothing that helps out.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c10 c4">Elans:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;As the Psionic answer to being Human, the Elan can excel at any role and have the survivability to last in it.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c10 c4">Forgeborn:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Forgeborn get that important +2 Int that they love and get Racial Features that can really help shore up that squishiness. A good candidate for those who would like to go with Str on a Cryptic.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c4 c5">Half-</span><span class="c0">Giants</span><span class="c0">:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;The towering Half-Giants unfortunately lack the subtlety for this role. With no + to Int and a penalty to Dex, the stats don&rsquo;t work too well and their otherwise fantastic racials do little for most, though Str builds and Grammattons can make use of the amazing Powerful Build. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c10 c4">Maenads:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;With a floating +2, Maneads work somewhat like Elans but with a far more aggressive bent. If you want to wreck a bit more face as a Cryptic (which the flail prof helps with), then you could do worse than these angry sea-dwellers.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c4 c6">Norals:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Again, with traits that just don&rsquo;t work too well, Norals should probably pick something else.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">Orphiduans:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Orphiduans can make decent Cryptics, but don&rsquo;t have that +2 Int you&rsquo;ll want. On the other hand, they get racials that can make your scouting life easier and help you with your poisonous traps.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">Xephs:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;An option for the more social Cryptic, the Xeph has that agility you&rsquo;ll appreciate and a few other neat tricks to help keep you going.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c4">Paizo Races:</span><span>&nbsp;I&rsquo;m not going to list all of the Pa</span><span>i</span><span class="c1">zo races, but I will go through the core roster and any standouts.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c4 c5">Dwarves:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Dwarven stats do nothing for you and their racial traits don&rsquo;t help that much either. Probably not the best choice.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c10 c4">Elves:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Almost perfect stats, though the con penalty can hurt. Also gets some good scouting traits and some proficiencies you melee dex builds will like.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c4 c8">Humans:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Humans are good at everything with their floating +2 and free feat. Always a good choice, no matter what you are making.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">Halflings: </span><span class="c1">Small size is decent, but doesn&rsquo;t have the stats to get the most out of this class.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">Half-Orcs:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Floating +2 is nice and can get some good support for Str builds. Nothing they get is much help to most Cryptics though.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">Gnomes:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Small size can help, but the stats don&rsquo;t help at all. Their racials can be nifty, but there are better options.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c4 c8">Tieflings:</span><span>&nbsp;With the variants available, there is always a Tiefling for the job. They may not be the best option, but with their flexible stats and great support they are always a strong contender. Your best bet here is going to be default Tiefling, conveniently enough, for those perfect stats.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c10 c4">Aasimar:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Normally a great choice, only one type has that all-important +2 Int and they don&rsquo;t back it up with anything that compelling. They work, but not as well as hoped.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c10 c4">Dhampir:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;There are some Dhampir types with the stats you are looking for and their pseudo-undead nature gives some interesting options. Jhang-Shi and Vetala types are your best bet here.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c10 c4">Ratfolk:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;These sneaky fellows get the small size and statline you Dex builds will adore as well as some racial support that will really help out your scouting. Just be aware their Scent comes with a -2 to other types of Perception.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c15 c4">Sylphs:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Good scouts and Dex builds here, but squishy. Get good stuff to sneaking or a bit of extra defence to help with that bad Con.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c4">Bloodforge: </span><span class="c1">Bloodforge is another book by Dreamscarred Press that adds a lot of great support and racial options. There are quite a few in there, so I&rsquo;ll only go with the best.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c10 c4">Decan</span><span class="c4 c5">taur:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;With a good stat layout and some solid racials, Hooves and access to the right type support, Decantaurs make very good and agile Str Cryptics. Be careful of that -2 Con though. Obviously not so good if you prefer Dex.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c4 c8">Hexbrea</span><span class="c4 c5">thers:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Very good and vicious Str Cryptics, Hexbreathers are similar to Decantaurs but more durable&hellip;.and evil. Not so good for Dex Cryptics though.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c10 c4">Thrallspawn:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;While the stats are not quite perfect, having a +2 to Int with a downside you ignore along with being Psionic and having Natural Weapons makes the Thrallspawn very good at this job.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c4 c8">Trixie:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;With some access to flight, perfect stats for a ranged Cryptic, small size and the types for some good feat support, you could definitely do worse than a Trixie for a Dex Cryptic.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">Dreige: </span><span class="c1">Notable for the same reasons as the Half Giant, these guys don&rsquo;t have the stats to be great Cryptics but get the support that larger weapon users will love and are very good at breaking magic</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c25" id="h.nzpl31mshwpr"><span class="c19 c4">Class Features</span></h2><p class="c13"><span class="c1">These here are the meat of the class; the things that make the class do what it does. You don&rsquo;t get to pick a lot of these, but I&rsquo;ll make sure to go over the ones you do as well as note how important each one is to you.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c4 c8">Manifesting:</span><span class="c4 c40">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Most of the reason you are playing a Psionic class, your Manifesting is a massive part of what you do. The Cryptic gets up to 6th lvl powers with a power list that is nothing to sniff at. You will gain 20 powers through class progression and 128 Power Points before bonuses. This means you can&rsquo;t go crazy with your powers, but they are plenty to see you through.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">Pattern Designs (Su):</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">This one doesn&rsquo;t technically do anything mechanically, but what it does do is add some unique flavour to the class. All your powers known show as mystical tattoos on your body that glow when you use their assigned power. Unlike other Psionic Displays, these cannot be suppressed, so either be careful when you use them, or cover up if you don&rsquo;t want to be caught.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c10 c4">Altered Defence (Su):</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;While not something you should be relying on too much, your Altered Defence can give you that touch of survivability when you need it the most. Activating this bonus is a Swift Action and you can maintain it for 4+Int rounds per day, so use it sparingly.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">When active you pick from 3 boosts:</span></p><ul class="c18 lst-kix_r7wojlalhzj6-0 start"><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c20 c5">Damage Reduction</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c20">Dodge Bonus to AC</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c20 c37">Bonus on attack rolls against things that hit you last turn</span></li></ul><p class="c13"><span class="c1">The scaling on these is +1 every 4 lvls after 1st, so this will stay at least somewhat relevant throughout.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c4 c8">Disrupt Pattern (Su):</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">This trick is basically your signature move; a 1d6+Int range touch attack that acts as a delivery system for a lot of your later nasties. There are some caveats though. For one, this is a once per round deal (Unless you are a Brutal Disrupter, but I&rsquo;ll get to that in Archetypes), which is highly annoying and the damage on this is halved if you do not have the right monster type selected. You pick your monster type upon gaining Psionic Focus and can repick by refocusing. This is where your access to all Knowledge skills comes in as you WILL need to know just what you are facing to make the most of this.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c10 c4">Lesser Insights:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Get a couple of Psionic Talents. Sure, why not? I&rsquo;ll go over these later, but they are basically your version of Cantrips. Note that many Talents Augment into full powers, so with good picks this can basically act as having 2 extra full powers.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">Scribe </span><span class="c10 c4">Tattoo:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Psionic Tattoos are basically scrolls you implant onto your own skin and as such can only target you. You can only place up to 3rd lvl powers, so you can&rsquo;t get the really amazing stuff, but there is a lot of good knocking around in there. Clever planning of what you put on you is paramount if you are going to be wanting to use this, but if you decide to invest in it, the yield can be astounding.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c10 c4">Trapfinding: </span><span class="c1">As I said, you are the Psionic Rogue. This trick will help you out a load with your scouting and you have many ways to make use of this in ways other cannot, though I&rsquo;ll go over those later. This ability is damn good if you come across traps a lot and helps you with that low Wis on your Perception. That all said, a lot of stuff trades it out and it is VERY easy to grab from elsewhere.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">Trapmaker:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;A bonus to your ability to make traps will either be really helpful to you, or never come up, depending on your game. If you are looking to be the god of all things trap, then you&rsquo;ll like this, even if it does little on it&rsquo;s own.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c10 c4">Hidden Pattern (Ex): </span><span class="c1">A scaling bonus to Stealth that eventually lets you hide in plain sight? Yes please. You are going to be scouting ahead a lot, so this makes your job a lot easier. Obviously, you&rsquo;ll want to put some points into Stealth yourself, because this won&rsquo;t do it on it&rsquo;s own.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c4 c8">Insights (Su):</span><span class="c4 c40">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">These tricks are what defines how a Cryptic will be played. You get one of these every even level and there are quite a few to pick from. A lot of these also transform your Disrupt Pattern from a so-so damage dealer into a debuff nightmare. I&rsquo;ll go ahead and list them all for you in order of availability and separate out those that work with Disrupt Pattern, those that are Trap based, those that are Tattoo based and everything else.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c4">Disrupt Pattern Insights:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;All of these patterns enhance your Disrupt Pattern ability in some way, either by making it more reliable or by turning it into a debuf machine. All Cryptics are going to want some of these as they are what define your class. Take note that there is no limit to how many of these you can apply at once, so get enough and enemies (and your GM) will look upon your Disrupts with great dread.</span></p><ul class="c18 lst-kix_lmldm1s4mta9-0 start"><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">1st - Disrupted Healing</span><span class="c4">: </span><span class="c1">A lot of things won&rsquo;t notice this as they tend not to heal, but on those that do, this is devastating. Being able to render the enemy Cleric or Vitalist almost worthless is going to make your life in human-enemy-centric campaigns so much easier it isn&rsquo;t funny. This gets less useful if your encounters tend not to heal.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c5">1st - Discerning Pattern</span><span class="c4">: </span><span class="c1">Your Disrupt Pattern only works at it&rsquo;s best when you are attuned to the right enemy type, but all the planning in the world can sometimes still fail you. However, given you will likely have Psionic Meditation, you can bypass this by just refocusing and picking the right enemy type.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">4th - Binding Pattern:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Entangling on hit is sweet, especially when the DC to get out scales with you. This does minimise the damage you are dealing though, so generally don&rsquo;t keep this active when you don&rsquo;t need it.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c5">6th - Bleeding Pattern:</span><span>&nbsp;This isn&rsquo;t too great as the Bleed is low and doesn&rsquo;t stack with itself. If you have a spare Insight, sure, but you are generally better off spending elsewhere. Note that there are a few powers others get that make this more fun, but that is situational at best.</span><span class="c11 c4">&nbsp;</span></li></ul><ul class="c18 lst-kix_fh9kg8dydlgv-0 start"><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">6th - Explosive Pattern:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Splash Damage on your Disrupt is pretty neat, though it does not spread the debuffs. A cool way of taking down mook swarms and can make enemies stop forming up.</span></li></ul><ul class="c18 lst-kix_lmldm1s4mta9-0"><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c8">8th - Dislocating Pattern:</span><span>&nbsp;Giving out a free -2 to most stuff until something spends a standard to remove it is amazing! I mean, sure, Vitalists will take it away easily, but if they are doing that then they aren&rsquo;t healing and you spent no extra actions on this. Works even better if you have ways of spreading it around.</span><span class="c11 c4">&nbsp;</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">8th - Shining Pattern:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">An AoE 15ft blind on hit is a fun toy, however it only lasts for a single round and Fort negates, bringing this down somewhat. Also, it is unfriendly so be careful of your allies. If you are careful, it works well, but there are too many downsides for it to shine as much as it&rsquo;s name would imply.</span></li></ul><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c4">Trap Insights:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;These insights enhance your affinity with traps, both making and finding them. If you are scouting you are going to want to consider the ones that help you spot the nasty devices and if you are planning on making them, then this is where you will be looking a lot. All of these that are about making traps rather than finding and removing them are rated under the assumption you like to make them.</span></p><ul class="c18 lst-kix_vews483y1ru7-0 start"><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">1st - Bypass Pattern:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">This is a great tool for when you don&rsquo;t have the time to disarm a trap or door manually or want to leave it intact for pursuers to get caught on. You do have to know the trap is there, but once you do, you have the tools to handle it.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">1st - Empow</span><span class="c10 c4">er Trap:</span><span>&nbsp;Eh, in my mind the best traps are those that do things other than damage, but this can still be nasty. Fortunately, this boost is permanent, so you can place it and forget about it. The more you use damaging traps, the better this gets.</span><span class="c11 c4">&nbsp;</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">1st - Fold Trap:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">You know what is often annoying about setting traps? It takes time to do, which you often do not have. Not any more, as you keep them in your pocket until you need them. If you are making a lot of traps, this will be invaluable and also allow you to just deploy them in combat if you want. Is it just me, or is the idea of carrying a pitfall trap in your pocket hilarious? Requires Quick Trapsmith.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">1st - Quick Disable:</span><span>&nbsp;Pretty good, but you have Bypass for when things get dicey on time.</span><span class="c11 c4">&nbsp;</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c8">1st - Quick Trapsmith:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Fred Jones, the Insight. This lets you throw together a Home Alone style deathtrap in mere seconds, though you need to know what you are doing to make sure it works. If you like to make traps, this is great. If not&hellip;.well why are you looking in the trap section?</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c8">1st - Swift Trigger:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;So, this has 2 main uses. The first one is to turn your traps into remote-activated death machines, while the other is to safely set off traps you can&rsquo;t disarm for whatever reason (such as being unable to make the DC. Just be careful of self-rearming traps). Either way, this is cool.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c8">1st - Trap Spotter:</span><span>&nbsp;If you are scouting around traps, you want this. Sometimes you forget or fail the perception check, so an automatic retry as soon as you get near is a godsend. Take this.</span></li></ul><ul class="c18 lst-kix_xbgomuye3t1-0 start"><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">6th - Ranger Trap:</span><span>&nbsp;Gain the ability to make Traps as the Trapper Ranger does, albeit only one per take of this Insight. Unlike the Ranger, you can actually use these really well without losing much (Fold Pattern and Swift Trigger make you into a sort of Alchemist) and some good picks on these will turn them into your go-to options for making traps. These time out once deployed, but remember you can put them in your pocket with Fold Pattern which allows you to spend an hour at the end of the day to make as many as you can for later. I won&rsquo;t list them here, but you can find the lot of them </span><span class="c12"><a class="c21" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger/archetypes/paizo---ranger-archetypes/trapper/ranger-traps&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117684763000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2mHfvdXNhvYt6UyDA7BRdo">here</a></span><span class="c1">. My general advice is to look for utility, rather than damage as the punch on these is lackluster at best.</span></li></ul><ul class="c18 lst-kix_vews483y1ru7-0"><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c5">8th - Claim </span><span class="c10 c4">Pattern:</span><span>&nbsp;For those who like to steal other people&rsquo;s traps, this can be fun. Shame you can only have the one and generally cannot relocate them without GM approval.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">In the right situation, this is neat, but otherwise won&rsquo;t see much use. Plus, the traps that CAN be relocated can often just be reassembled once you have taken them apart. Goes up if you want Redirect.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">10th - Efficient </span><span class="c4 c5">Trapsmith:</span><span>&nbsp;If you are making traps the normal way, they can get expensive quick. This one depends entirely on how often you make traps in conventional ways, but if you do it a lot, this will save you quite a bit of money.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Otherwise, skip it.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">10th - Redirect Trap:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;This one is pretty fun as one of the common problems with traps is getting an enemy in the right place for them. Well, worry no longer as you can now have the effect of a trap go off up to 30ft away from where it should do! If this sounds silly and makes you want to troll the basic euclidean laws of reality, then you are thinking correctly.</span></li></ul><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c4">Tattoo Insights:</span><span>&nbsp;These insights are all about getting the most out of your Psionic Tattoos. There are not many of them, but they can really help you bring out the true power of the powers you engrave onto yourself. Obviously if you trade out your ability to make Tattoos, these all become</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c6">red</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><ul class="c18 lst-kix_25r2m292tol1-0 start"><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c8">1st - Enhance Tattoo:</span><span>&nbsp;This thing is utterly godly as tattoos, like Psi-like abilities, are fully augmented up to the manifester level. This means manifesting at your lvl rather than the lowest possible is fantastic and makes your tattoos incredibly powerful when you need them. Just remember that using this too much gets expensive due to the cost of Tattoos, but nowhere near as expensive as actually making tattoos of this level would be.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">1st - Extend Tattoo:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Doubling the duration of your longer-lasting or more powerful tattoos can make them a lot more valuable. Required for Eternal Tattoo.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c5">1st - Steal Tattoo</span><span class="c4">: </span><span class="c1">This is a really situational ability that won&rsquo;t see much use in anything other than the most Psionic of campaigns. I mean, sure, nabbing someone else&rsquo;s buffs is great, but it only works if they actually have tattoos, which few do.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c41">16th - Eternal Tattoo:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">This, right here is absolutely amazing if you choose well. Getting the effect of a power semi-permanently is ungodly if you pick well. I&rsquo;m really quite fond of poaching Form Astral Armour to become a junior Aegis, or for those who don&rsquo;t poach, Concealing Amorphea, Greater is fantastic as a perma-buff. This one gets a unique rating because of how damn good it is.</span></li></ul><p class="c3"><span class="c11 c4"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c4">Other Insights:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;All of these insights have standalone uses not tied to any of the others.

You Dex builds and scouts will like this.</span><span class="c11 c4">&nbsp;</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c15 c4">1st - Shatter Pattern:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Thematic and can be fun, but there are better options out there. If you see yourself using this a lot, then go ahead and take it. Otherwise, this can go on the backburner.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c5">1st - Social Pattern:</span><span>&nbsp;You are unlikely to be too social with your rubbish </span><span>Charisma, but if something possesses you to try, this is your gateway into it. Not a recommended path though.</span><span class="c11 c4">&nbsp;</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">1st - Steal Pattern:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span>Hello, Spellthief, you came back! I really quite like this as it can make you really adaptive. It&rsquo;s potency will vary wildly based</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;on what you face, but often the nastiest things to go against are those with the best tricks to steal.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c15 c4">1st - Recognize Pattern:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">While it would be better to never need this, sometimes you get unlucky. This works particularly well against Grapplers as they need to sustain it, but for spell effects, the ones you&rsquo;d want this in effect against the most will be the sort that failing against once will be horrible. As a bonus, this is good against the quicker poisons.</span></li></ul><ul class="c18 lst-kix_oxbjo9qnuygx-0 start"><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c5">6th - Repair Pattern:</span><span>&nbsp;A bit of healing is nice, but it just isn&rsquo;t enough to be too useful. Leave this to the Vitalist.</span><span class="c11 c4">&nbsp;</span></li></ul><ul class="c18 lst-kix_mmrmamtnhp98-0"><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">10th - Improved Evasion:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Improved Evasion is pretty good for you as you will be guaranteeing your avoidance of the worst AoE damage.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">10th - Light-bending Pattern:</span><span>&nbsp;Oh, free invisibility for a decent amount of time per day? I&rsquo;ll take that as a sneaky scout. That said, if you are short on Insights, you have powers that can do similar things, so&hellip;..</span><span class="c11 c4">&nbsp;</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">14th - Join Patterns:</span><span>&nbsp;Inflict an Affinity Field on two targets with no cost, though they must be touchable. Can effectively double the damage</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">your party deals to a pair of enemies, which is pretty damn nice. Works very well if you get the drop on someone and can get a tank and something squishy at the same time. Note that taking this makes Bonding Strike obsolete, while taking the power lowers this Insight&rsquo;s rating.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">12th - Summoning Pattern:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">This one has two main uses; kidnapping and evac. Either way, being able to teleport targets to a specific place as many times as you need is great. Alternatively, it makes the journey home after a long day really quick. Shame you can&rsquo;t have 2 so you can act as a go-between on longer journeys.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c8">12th - Throw Pattern:</span><span>&nbsp;50ft at-will teleport as a Standard. Need I say more?</span><span class="c11 c4">&nbsp;</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c15 c4">16th - Rebuild Pattern:</span><span>&nbsp;This will literally save a life when you need it, but only works once per day. If you are getting to this lvl and your healer doesn&rsquo;t have a way to revive, then you are doing something badly wrong (or are in a game that restricts such things). On the other hand, it may well be your healer who needs reviving, to may be worth it as a backup.</span><span class="c11 c4">&nbsp;</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c8">16th - Reforming Pattern:</span><span>&nbsp;An automatic self-revive is an invaluable tool, even if you have to remake it every few days. You will need a safe place for this and it takes its toll when you come back, but it means you have a failsafe when you need it most. I can see absolutely no reason not to have this. &nbsp;</span><span class="c11 c4">&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">Enhanced Disruption:</span><span>&nbsp;This is where your Disrupt Pattern damage scales. At 3rd, 5th, 7th and so on, add another d6 to your Disrupt damage. Alas, it also makes sure </span><span class="c4 c6">you can&rsquo;t make use of Vital Strike or Crits</span><span class="c1">, which sucks hard as that would have helped with the 1/round issue.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c10 c4">Evasion:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Evasion is always neat and with your high Reflex save, should help you avoid a goodly amount of AoE damage.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c4 c5">Rapid Defence:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;You can now spend focus to activate Altered Defence as a Free action, even off turn. If you REALLY need that boost NOW, then this is good, but otherwise is bad due to the inherent problems of Altered Defence&rsquo;s longevity.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">Swift Trapper:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;This one&rsquo;s usefulness varies wildly based on how often you use your trapmaking. If you make them a lot, then this lets you make them faster. If not, then&hellip;..eh.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c4 c8">Enduring Defence:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">So, remember what I said before about using Altered Defence sparingly? Well, ignore that completely as you can now have it on at all times. You still only get one of it&rsquo;s boosts at a time, but this is still pretty neat and you can swap them as a Swift. Shame you had to wait until now for this to turn up&hellip;.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">Unchanging</span><span class="c4 c5">&nbsp;Pattern:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;12+Cryptic Level in Power Resistance. Spell/Power Resistance is, unfortunately, just as often a hindrance as a help as it also means healing and buffs your allies give you can get resisted.

At lvl 20 you get 2 normal Insights and a special Supreme Insight. You get to pick one of these and one only. These are powerful, but the rating is lower due to the rarity of these ever coming up.</span></p><ul class="c18 lst-kix_j6xcgs8z0g7q-0 start"><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Awakened Insight:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;A typeless +2 to Int is nothing to sniff at, but I was expecting&hellip;.more.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c8">Discerning Vision:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Permanent True Sight is sweet, plus absolute immunity to all but the most powerful visual effects. This one is a very good pick.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">Eternal Pattern:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;It might just be me, but Immortality seems like something you should get as a quest reward or something else in-game. I mean, it&rsquo;s nice and certainly a thematic thing to take, but I&rsquo;m not personally convinced. This one does get better if you have big age penalties, as they are immediately removed.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c5">Greater Disruption:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Alright for a Brutal Disrupter or Grammaton, but even then, by this point damage is somewhat negligible.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">Personal Design:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;I am become skin, bearer of Ink. This lets you keep a massive number of tattoos in reserve, automatically identify other tattoos and activate your tattoos as an immediate.

Bleh, next.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Unravel Pattern:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;This one is very flavourful as I can&rsquo;t think of many cooler ways to kill something than unravelling it&rsquo;s pattern until it fades away into its constituent concepts. On the other hand, they need to be low on HP, it is 1/day, they get a Fort save and it is an oft-resisted Death effect. Those are some pretty big drawbacks that really let it down.</span></li></ul><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c25" id="h.l54en27730vt"><span class="c19 c4">Powers</span></h2><p class="c13"><span>Almost as much as your Class Features, y</span><span class="c1">our Powers are a VERY important part of your build.

In mythic, this property becomes both permanent and inherited, so if you ever wanted to cultivate a natural garden of colorful glowing greenery, go ahead.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c5">Conceal Thoughts:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Much better than it looks, but still not great. Just about all Bluff checks are opposed, and this is usually by Sense Motive. Assuming you use the skill with any frequency, this is a +10 in an uncommon bonus type to it. On the other hand, you aren&rsquo;t a face. Rating goes up if you regularly face telepaths and the like, as well.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c5">Create Sound:</span><span>&nbsp;A useful little trick, and it will help you set up effective bluffs or intimidates (or just distract guards to slip on by)</span><span>.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c8">Detect Psionics:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;The Detect spells are all good to have, and this one can be self-augmented into an Identify effect. If you have full transparency with magic (which is the default), this is probably the strongest Talent you can pick.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Distract:</span><span>&nbsp;The save is going to be very weak due to being 0-</span><span class="c1">level. -4 penalty to two major skills can be clutch, so it isn&rsquo;t worthless, but remember that you will often be able to set up circumstance penalties with other abilities.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c5">Ectoplasmic Trinket:</span><span>&nbsp;This</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;one&rsquo;s usefulness is entirely dependent on how resourceful you are. You need to think of the perfect items to create for that situation. This can be great if you find yourself without tools of any kind to work with.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c5">Empathy:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;One of the more often-used scouting powers, especially if you use the second Augment and set it up where enemies won&rsquo;t be alerted by the display.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Far Hand:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;This is basically Psionic Mage Hand. If you can be creative with it, like for setting off your traps when needed, this can be great, but otherwise a bit lacklustre.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c5">Float:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Eh, just swim it normally.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c5">Fortify, Lesser:</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Doesn&rsquo;t scale in any way and doesn&rsquo;t last long enough to be worth the actions. Avoid.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c5">Missive:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;A decent scouting power, lets you get word back to your buddies as long as they&rsquo;re close. The range hurts, though, as does the fact that it&rsquo;s one-way.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">My Light:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Having a source of light is useful, but being able to see in the dark would be better. The light here can help your allies, but can also give you away.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">Psionic Repair:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;I am quite fond of this one as there are so many times when you may want to fix something up. Grammatons will also like this as it can help them with their misfire troubles.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c6">Telekinetic Punch:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;I cannot imagine a situation where 1 damage that allows a will save would be useful. Skip this, and don&rsquo;t be fooled by the Force descriptor.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c6">Vim: </span><span class="c1">One temporary HP is going to be useful for about the first 35 seconds of your adventuring career. Pass.</span></li></ul><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c11 c4">1st-Level Cryptic Powers</span></p><p class="c13"><span>These are your basic bread-and-butter abilities that will often be with you your whole career. As such, look for persistent utility and good Augment scaling</span></p><ul class="c18 lst-kix_47bek8rqg0q8-0 start"><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c23">Absorb</span><span class="c4 c8">&nbsp;Dorje:</span><span class="c4 c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Dorje&rsquo;s are like wands and this lets you eat one to manifest the power it contains like it was one of your own for the day. Unfortunately, you cannot use it to poach powers from off your list this way. While it is a bit tricky to manage, you can use this to basically swipe the entire power list by buying min lvl versions of as many powers as you can get, so I&rsquo;d suggest this be a power you take later in your career. If your game becomes Mythic, this becomes mandatory as you get the ability to have a bunch of them absorbed at once.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c5">Absorb </span><span class="c0">Weapon:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;As a Cryptic, you are not too likely to be using weapons that much, but if you happen to be so and need to sneak in somewhere, this can be invaluable. It does augment quite nicely though and lasts a good while, so if you are in a very social game, this can be a great way to never be caught unarmed and unarmoured.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Accelerant:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;You cover someone in tar to make them easier to molotov later. It can be quite a bit of damage and force an enemy to flee or spend actions to put out. This is one of those powers that lives and dies off it&rsquo;s damage type. A lot of things are weak to fire, but a lot of things are highly resistant or outright immune, including a lot of common enemy types. It also has a mythic version that makes the target explode if they die while on fire, potentially spreading the effect. Sounds potent, but I&rsquo;ve not looked too much at mythic.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c5">Accelerated Entropy:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Break something; the power. If you need to break a thing, use this on it and it falls apart. Unfortunately, it is limited to consumables and non-magical objects, which hampers its usefulness.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">Bullet Time: </span><span class="c1">Make Reflex saves to avoid ranged attacks from a single target as an immediate interrupt. It has a rather interesting augment that lets you keep spending power points the more attacks come in, so you don&rsquo;t need to guess how often they&rsquo;ll shoot at you. You don&rsquo;t have much HP, so getting shot, especially by bullets sucks. It also works in Rays, so this one actually stays relevant even as HP does not. Relies on your Reflex being good though.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c8">Call to Mind, Lanis&rsquo;s:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;With your need to get Knowledge Checks off right, this can be an invaluable tool. A reroll is basically a +5, so this becomes a +9 when you need it most. Plus, you have ALL the knowledges, so you will be in the position to use this a lot.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Chameleon:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Pretty good boost to a skill you&rsquo;ll like, but note that this technically only affects Visual stuff. Good early on, but gets supplanted quickly. Still cheap to use though and lasts an alright time.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Your first Save or Suck is an odd one that takes some major timing to make use of. It basically makes the enemy do exactly what it just did if it fails, unless it can&rsquo;t, in which case it does nothing. Consider using this when the foe just used their 1/day SLA or when it&rsquo;s target is no longer there.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c5">Elfsight:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Not too good a bonus in real terms and the duration isn&rsquo;t too great either. Goes up a little bit if you have no source of Low-Light Vision, but there are still better options.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">Environment Shield:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;The base effect of this power is kinda useless, as you can just buy some protective clothing. It is the augments that really sell this one. Those are a lot of day-long immunities to some very nasty things, and they can also be passed around if needed. That does get real hungry on your PP, but if you have to choose between PP and a party member getting gassed, you&rsquo;d choose the PP.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c6">Fortify:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Nah, too many things give Resistance bonuses. If you want a Save booster, look a bit further down.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c8">Guidance of the Ancestors:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;This can help you out a great deal and stacks with Call to Mind. The ability to gain Languages as soon as you need them is also great while the Proficiency option can do stuff like allow you to quickly grab a shield when you need it.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Hidden Pocket:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;A power that works better the more creative you are, this can be great for hiding a holdout weapon, tool or stolen object.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c5">Inevitable Strike, Roshan&rsquo;s:</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span>The power for when you REALLY need this next shot to hit, this is really situational, but shines when it is needed. Probably won&rsquo;t be needed that much though</span><span>...</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c5">Kinetic Legerdemain:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Situational as hell, but has its merits. Not needing to fear loss of your lockpicks is neat, as is the boost to the check. Shame the distance augment is so expensive though&hellip;.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c5">Locate Secret Doors:</span><span>&nbsp;I can&rsquo;t help but be unsure about this one. I mean, it seems useful, but it doesn&rsquo;t really do anything a good Perception won&rsquo;t and doesn&rsquo;t augment in any way. Probably not worth it unless your Perceptions sucks for some </span><span>bizarre</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;reason.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Know Direction and Location:</span><span class="c37">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">This one is interesting if you are having to navigate a lot as you can expend focus to remove its cost. This gets better the more you risk getting lost and can help you with your planar travels, but all in all, may not ever come up. Gets better if you teleport or plane shift a lot.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Malfu</span><span class="c4 c6">nction:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;You get to mess up Tech items. Could be good to mess with the Technic League, but if you aren&rsquo;t in Numeria or some similar location, this is worthless.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c8">Metamorphosis, Minor:</span><span class="c40">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">This one is great. The ability to change your face cheaply is pretty damn good if you&rsquo;ve been sneaking around doing bad stuff. Even if you aren&rsquo;t looking to alter your face, this provides some pretty handy abilities, such as uncommon movement types.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Mind Palace:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Spend an immediate action to get +1d4/PP to your next roll. Can be clutch, but you don&rsquo;t have the PP to keep using this outside of emergencies</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c5">Mindscape Lens:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Very niche power that lets you spy on what someone is doing in their mental real estate. Also lets you look at their dreams. I&rsquo;ve never had this come up, but if you have a villain who literally makes phone calls from their office inside their brain, it could be useful.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c5">Morbid</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Fascin</span><span class="c10 c4">ation:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Now this is interesting as seeing into the Ethereal can be a real boon in the right campaign&hellip;&hellip; Or be completely useless. The penalty to Will while active hurts too, so be careful with this. It&rsquo;s augment is pretty neat if you fight a lot of Ethereal creatures too, but again, very situational which brings it down some. As such, the rating here is all over the place depending on your game.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c8">Precognition</span><span class="c4 c8">, Defensive:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Insight bonuses to saves and AC are not common, and this ages very well with both its duration and augments (the 6-point to get it going as a Swift is notable, in case you don&rsquo;t have it ready when you get ambushed, but this is a harsh drain on your limited PP).</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">Precognition, Offensive:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Bonuses to attack rolls will help you land effects, and greatly assists in making up for your 3/4 BAB if you are taking a more combat-oriented role.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c5">Precognition, Tactical:</span><span>&nbsp;You aren&rsquo;t too likely to be doing Combat Maneuvers, so this one won&rsquo;t help you too much. Goes up if you are a </span><span class="c10">Pattern Breaker</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;because you&rsquo;ll like to Sunder.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c33">Prescience, Offensive</span><span class="c4 c5">:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;These damage bonuses rack up very slowly, but it&rsquo;s a rare bonus type if you are going in for raw damage.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c5">Steal La</span><span class="c10 c4">nguage</span><span class="c10">:</span><span>&nbsp;This one is best for subterfuge and intrigue games, as you gain the languages a target knows while they lose it. Not only can this let you understand people in a foreign land, but it quickly scales into the ability to just rob people of the ability to talk, understand people, read, write, anything that needs a language and for a rather quickly growing duration. Ask your GM how this works on casters with verbal components, because in </span><span class="c9">theory</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;it is like a silence effect but even worse for them.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Temporary Blindness:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Blind is a nasty condition to have, so this can be really good. Unfortunately, it targets Fort and they get to keep saving to make it go away, so many of the things you&rsquo;ll likely want to do this to the most are the hardest to keep blind, but augments help this power stay in effect. Later on removes the &lsquo;Temporary&rsquo; part, so that&#39;s fun and can eventually have you permanently blinding whole rooms of targets. If you have some form of Sneak Attacker in the party, they&rsquo;ll love you with this.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c6">Transfer </span><span class="c10 c4">Energy:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Manage the power in your tech items. If you are going Circuitbreaker in a tech-heavy game, get this. If not, don&rsquo;t bother.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Vigor:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Can be a pretty neat boost to your durability and Augments well, but you may not have the PP to make this worth it too much.</span></li></ul><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c11 c4">2nd-Level Cryptic Powers</span></p><p class="c13"><span>Still low level, but getting a bit more powerful, these abilities are going to face competition from your Augmented 1st lvl powers, so avoid overlap.</span></p><ul class="c18 lst-kix_pou57gvc7c3h-0 start"><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c5">Accelerate Body:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;You make a day pass for a target for negative or positive reasons, or both. Unfortunately, you don&rsquo;t have the kit to really work with this, but can be a good way to shake off burn effects. Consider it for that side, but ignore the negative.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c5">Animal Affinity, Lanis&rsquo;s:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;This is a damn good power, but the duration is not long enough for you and you don&rsquo;t have the PP to be using it all the time. Leave this to your Vitalist.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Apathetic Aura:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;You emit an aura of being Somebody Else&rsquo;s Problem that also covers your allies. Unfortunately, the range on this is far too small for my liking, making what could be a great form of partial pseudo-invisibility far less than it could be.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c6">Body Adjustment:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Nowhere near enough healing for the cost here. Don&rsquo;t bother.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c5">Body Equilibrium:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Too situational for my liking. If you know this will be a thing, like if you are in an island-hopping campaign or are surrounded in quicksand, then sure. Otherwise, skip this.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c5">Body Purification:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Decent enough for an emergency, but otherwise too costly for you. Another one to leave to your Vitalist.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c5">Bore:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;You get to look through walls by making a peephole through them. This peephole only makes sense to you, only works visually and only goes one way. Spies and voyeurs may like this, but it is a bit niche to be spending a power on most of the time unless you know you&rsquo;ll have a way to use it. If you party likes to go Breach and Clear, Rainbow Six style, this might be more up your alley.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">Breach:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;It is likely going to be your job to get the doors open so having a way to take apart magical locks is going to be very worth it for you if you do that a lot.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c7">Captivity Bond:</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">The target of this power suddenly becomes only able to take non-lethal damage. Good for capturing targets alive, I guess, but you may as well just take the slight penalty. It does have the ability for you to do something silly, like blow up a man&rsquo;s house in a non-lethal fashion and I&rsquo;m sure someone more clever than me can work out a way to abuse this.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c8">Cloud Mind:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">In many ways, this is even better than invisibility as you cannot be detected by any means by creatures under this effect. On the downside, it only affects what it targets, though augments help with that, while another augment lets you use it immediately upon being spotted.. Doesn&rsquo;t work on &lsquo;dem rattling skeletons though.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c15 c4">Clutching the Shroud:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span>If you ever wanted to pretend to be spooky, this is your dream come true. Unfortunately you don&rsquo;t actually become undead, so no immunities for you. You can augment to get them, but that starts getting expensive to you.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">Concealing Amorpha:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">You already have raw AC/Saves and a save-or-miss, this gives you a third kind of defense in pure miss chance. Also assists allies next to you if augmented, which they will thank you for.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c8">Control Sound:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Limited only by your imagination on how to use it, this power can be amazing to create distractions or mess with people&rsquo;s heads. Be aware that using it to alter words or mimic voices requires a Bluff check you may struggle with while muffling noise needs Stealth, though you should have that down.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">Dead</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c5">Hand:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">This one is one of those powers that is highly useful in spookier campaigns but less so in others, especially for you weapon using types. There can be some fun trick you can do with this like putting your hand in someone&rsquo;s chest to freak them out, but this can very often not come up.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c15 c4">Defy Gravity:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;As long as you have something to push against, this can be used as flight (though it is more like being in zero-grav). Bit situational, but can be useful.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">Detect Hostile Intent:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Never get ambushed again as long as you have this on as well as knowing when the mood is about to turn bloody at a ball. Also helps you gauge someone&rsquo;s mood almost immediately. It is Mind-Affecting though, so be careful of quietly rattling skeletons.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Dirt Nap:</span><span>&nbsp;You make a foxhole for you and the boys to go camping in. While in here, you cannot be seen or targeted from the outside, but there isn&rsquo;t much stopping someone jumping in to crash your no-ghouls-allowed sleepover if they saw you make it. Still, safe sleeping spots are valuable, so if nobody else has any way to do this, go ahead.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c5">Distracting</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c15 c4">Strike:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Eh, this could be better as it requires you to hit and it be on something that likes to make Opportunity attacks that matter. Obviously, if your GM likes to use Path of War on you this gets better as no Cryptic wants to be stuck near a Warder, but in that case, you shouldn&rsquo;t have got near in the first place.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c7">Ectoplasmic Charged Armor:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;You get Spike damage, but unlike the Psychic Warrior this was made for, you don&rsquo;t have the HP to rely on this. Put your effort into not getting hit instead.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c5">Ectoplasmic Obelisk:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;You make a statue that sits there in the way and does statue things. If you ever wanted to block a road by conjuring a dickbutt, sure go ahead, but the fact people can just push it away limits the usefulness. Or you could just leave statues of your smug face everywhere, I guess.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">Energy Adaptation, Specified:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span>This will be one of the very few powers you get that runs off your energy type. As such, you will not have the problem a lot of others have when using this. That said, it can take time to get your active energy attuned to what you need. Nicely enough, the resistance scales on it&rsquo;s own, so this can really save your skin if you know you are going into the cave of fire elementals.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c5">Everyman:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Somewhat obsolete as Minor Metamorphosis does this, but the duration is better.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">Heightened</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c6">Vision:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;If you are scouting, it may well be in the dark and being able to see will help you do this a lot. Obviously, if you already have Darkvision from somewhere this is utterly pointless for you.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">Holographic Projection:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;You make illusions that can include images, sounds and even thermal changes as part of them. Unlike normal illusions, these are actually real images, so they don&rsquo;t just vanish when you disbelieve them. Definitely one of the ones that is limited only by your creativity and comes with a whole bunch of augments to make the illusions even more versatile and all-encompassing. If you have the mindset you use it, you could make entire characters around this power, but unfortunately for you, you don&rsquo;t have too many PP.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c5">Memory Revelation:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;You share memories with someone, either watching some of theirs or giving them some of yours to watch. More for intrigue games or when you need to know if that guy really did kill the butler in the lounge with the lead pipe. Augments can also be useful, but this is really game dependent. If your game needs it though and you can be creative with its use, this can be a game changing tool.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">Me</span><span class="c10 c4">mory</span><span class="c10 c4">&nbsp;Regression:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;You attempt to lobotomise the target, dealing Wis, Int and Cha, but only to a min of 1. Interestingly, this can be done with your choice of Fort or Will save, changing the type of power it is based on this choice. If this happens, they lose the ability to do a lot of stuff, but they can still tell you are an enemy. This is actually quite a lot of attribute damage, so is best suited as a way of destroying casters on whichever save is worse for them. 2 extra PP makes the duration permanent, so if for some reason you wanted to actually reduce someone to an animalistic state, this is how.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c7">Mental </span><span class="c4 c8">Semblance:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Impersonate anyone you have touched with a startling level of accuracy. While this won&rsquo;t be useful in most dungeon crawls, if you are playing a more intrigue based game, this is a phenomenal tool. Shake hands with the Police Chief, then become him and get him framed for corruption. Do the same to the Mayor and give yourself an invoice for half the city treasury. The possibilities are endless. Just be careful of sniffer dogs, as they and other scent-based creatures will NOT be fooled.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c5">Natural Linguist:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Guidance of the Ancestors does this and more, so this is somewhat obsolete. Unlike Guidance though, you don&rsquo;t need to know just what language it is you are after when you use it, so it does have some merit there.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c15 c4">Myra&rsquo;s</span><span class="c4 c45">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c8">Occultation:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;This is much more likely to be a GM weapon against Knowledge-spamming players, but if your opponents are played as smart this will be a REAL gem when they think the best way to fight you is the thing you&rsquo;re actually awesome against.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c5">Psionic Scent:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;I would love to rate this well because I love having Scent, even when I&rsquo;m not a scout. The problem is that it&rsquo;s duration is far too short to be worthwhile.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c6">Resist</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c10 c4">Toxin:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;By default, poisons suck and are not worth worrying about. If you are running with Unchained Poisons and a GM who likes to use them, this gets better as those things can be brutal.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c5">Shape th</span><span class="c15 c4">e Shade:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">This one is a strange sort of alternative to Minor Metamorphosis that works on others but will usually need Augmenting to use on the living, albeit only to disguise them as the dead. Most games won&rsquo;t have a place for it, but if there are lots of ghosts and necromancers to chat with, befriend and infiltrate, then this can be pretty useful.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c6">Wall Walker:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Just get a Climb speed from Minor Metamorphosis instead.</span></li><li class="c2 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1"></span></li></ul><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c11 c4">3rd-Level Cryptic Powers</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">Getting a bit more powerful here, there is quite a bit of utility to be found in here. Few things that are absolute must haves, but there are some really neat tricks on offer in this set.</span></p><ul class="c18 lst-kix_6fop932aozoh-0 start"><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">Concealing Amorpha, Greater:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Great for the same reasons as it&rsquo;s younger sister, this is a great power to have at your disposal.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">Danger Sense:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;If you are scouting this will make your job a lot easier and also augments to give you both versions of Uncanny Dodge. The duration is hour/lvl too, so this can be a great &lsquo;start of the day&rsquo; buff when you get higher up.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c8">Dispel Psionics:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Always a great tool to have in any magical situation. You&rsquo;ll want this as a way of removing nasty magical stuff you can&rsquo;t get to otherwise or removing enemy buffs.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c8">Ectoplasmic Grapnel, Syonique&rsquo;s:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Now, this I love, even if it is expensive to use often. If you want examples of how to use this, read some Spiderman.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c8">Escape Detection:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span>It is all well and good being sneaky and clever if your targets already know you are coming because they scryed on you. Same goes for being invisible if they have True Sight. This protects you from this and has great duration, so you can keep this up nearly all the time.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c6">Evade Burst:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Not really sure why this is here as you get Evasion on your own and can get Improved as an Insight. Ignore this.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c6">Sharpened Edge:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;This one hits the problem of the fact your Disrupt Pattern cannot crit. As such, if you are a basic ranged Cryptic then this does nothing for you. For everyone else this isn&rsquo;t too good either as it only works on the one and you will likely be TWFing and Keen is hardly expensive.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Ubiquitous Vision:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Never be flanked again and get a little buff to your Perception while you are at it. On the other hand, beware of Symbols and Gorgons while this is active because a -4 to vision-based saves is nasty.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">Resting with</span><span class="c4 c40">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c8">the Fallen:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Flavourful as hell and can be really damn good if you are willing to pay for the Augments. Gaining the ability to learn everything your fallen foes did is fantastic, even if it takes you quite a while to be able to reach back very far, though do note that your GM may play the &lsquo;memories are unreliable&rsquo; card. Can also mess with enemies who are likely to come back from the dead and the ability to puppet your foe as a Wight is awesome for a suicide scouting run.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c5">Shade </span><span class="c10 c4">Venom</span><span class="c10 c4">:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;If poisons didn&rsquo;t suck, this could be great in the right campaign. Unfortunately they do. Goes up nicely if you are using Unchained Poison rules, but note that the worst poisons (Con damage) still do nothing. As a return though, Cha poisons tend to be more powerful, so&hellip;.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">Fracture Pattern:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;A power that, if you correctly identify any existing weaknesses, can enable others in your party to inflict horrendous amounts of damage. Most of the time, you won&rsquo;t personally see that much benefit from this, but never underestimate a force multiplier. Obviously drops if you are lacking major damage dealers to get the most out of this.</span></li></ul><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c11 c4">4th-Level Cryptic Powers</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">Getting to the upper shelves now, these abilities are going to be major moments of note when you use them and as such require more consideration than their throwaway smaller cousins.</span></p><ul class="c18 lst-kix_qbrv47hjr313-0 start"><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c8">Disrupting</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c6">Strikes:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;This power annoys the hell out of me even as I acknowledge its insane potency. The ability to lay out a number of Disruptions at once is amazing and can spread those debuffs like a rat spreads the plague. It is just a shame it costs every time you use it, which eats into your precious PP. Basically worthless for Brutal Disruptors as they can already do this with their attacks or people who don&rsquo;t want to disrupt more than once for whatever reason (Spheres of Might and Vital Strike come to mind).</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">Energy Adaptation:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Much like it&rsquo;s little sister, the full version of Energy Adaption doesn&rsquo;t require you to mess around with active types and lets you be fabulous as you give off bursts of light whenever it reduces damage. It even scales at the same rate, but is considerably more expensive.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c8">Fold Space:</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">A teleport at Long range is nothing to sniff at. Can get you into many places or across many obstacles you wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise be able to get past, so this is definitely worth having. It can get hungry on the PP though, so be careful about using it too much.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">Hidden Body:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Hide in the body of an ally to sneak into somewhere or let the tank make an escape with you. Alternatively, hide the Barbarian in your head and unleash him on your foes right when they least expect it. This is a great power, but faces stiff competition next level from it&rsquo;s unwilling cousins.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c8">Slip the Bonds:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Freedom of Movement, the power. This is excellent as you REALLY don&rsquo;t want to get locked down somewhere or get stuck in anything dangerous&hellip;.like a big guy&rsquo;s grapple.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">Steadfast Perception:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Illusions are something that can really throw you off and mess you up, so having a hard counter to them is a sweet tool as the guy whose job it is to see things coming and deal with them.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">Vanishing Strike:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Expensive, but a good way to nerf-and-run or just escape something nasty that likes to chase as you become invisible after teleporting away. Again, try not to rely on this too much as it will consume PP readily.</span></li></ul><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c11 c4">5th-Level Cryptic Powers</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">Really getting to the best toys for you, your 5th level powers will be the kind of things you use to resolve a battle or challenge almost on their own. These will be tough to pick from as there is a lot of good stuff here.</span></p><ul class="c18 lst-kix_r40cpup9zo5x-0 start"><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">Adapt</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c6">Body:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;If this comes up, you will likely know about it already. Very good for plane-shifting and even just for extreme deserts or tundras this can allow you to thrive basically anywhere. It also lasts a very long time. Just make sure to renew it when you go to bed if you are relying on it to not die of exposure If you are in a more contained game, this is useless to you.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c15 c4">Bonding</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c6">Strike:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;This can be pretty damn brutal, but you can basically get this as an Insight, which means you will only want one of them. This one has the major downside of costing PP and only lasting 1 turn.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">Parasitic Possession:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;This one needs direct comparison with Riding the Shell, so I&rsquo;ll go over the basics first as you are unlikely to want both. In essence, it lets you hide inside another creature&rsquo;s head, watching through their eyes but unable to act. This one can be augmented to make it work in reverse, subsuming the other creature into yourself. I love this one, but it might not be useful to you in every game.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c8">Pierce the Veils:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a true-seeing effect. Why does this need to be discussed, again?</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Retrieve, Nimar&rsquo;s:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Stylish as hell, but seems too expensive for its effect. A good way to steal stuff through glass though as all you need to do is see the object, so it has uses there.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c5">Mind </span><span class="c4 c5">Trap</span><span class="c4 c5">:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;This isn&rsquo;t that great for you because you don&rsquo;t have the offensive powers that really make this shine. This goes up if you poach the relevant powers, but otherwise leave this one to the Dreads and Psions.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c8">Ex Nihilo:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Now this is more like it. Expensive it may be and you may not have the Cha to get the most out of this, but becoming an Incorporeal Undead is a major change to the way you play. Ranged Cryptics will adore this as you don&rsquo;t need to be physical to use Disrupt Pattern, though you do need to be aware that you lose access to any magic items you have that are not Ghost Touch or something similar.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">Riding the Shell:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Very similar to Parasitic Possession, Riding the Shell has a shorter duration than it&rsquo;s cousin, but it&rsquo;s augment is a very different kettle of fish. It allows you to manifest powers from inside the creature, which can do all sorts of things and will look like it is them doing it. You can do this to mess with people or even jump to another host without them knowing.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">Vascular Disruption, Kyria&rsquo;s:</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">First off, this can easily augment into an unholy amount of damage and plays well with many Metapsionic feats. The Entangle AoE rider is also good if your target is likely to fail the save.</span></li></ul><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c11 c4">6th-Level Cryptic Powers</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">The top powers you get and some real game changers, these are meant to be VERY powerful, but the expense is going to mean you will be reluctant to use them too often.</span></p><ul class="c18 lst-kix_apdh5whxnpd3-0 start"><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Aura</span><span class="c4 c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c10 c4">Alteration</span><span class="c4">:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Situational, this one is a power that will often be better served by other people. Its healing effect is best left to the Vitalist or Cleric, but can be good in a pinch. If you are Evil, or need to pretend to be Evil a lot, then this goes up some, so is better is more social campaigns.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c8">Barred Mind, Personal</span><span class="c4">:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;This just stops so much, keeping it up will probably be a priority for you (doubly true for sneaky types). Thankfully, it has a one day duration, meaning that doing so will only cost you 11 PP each day (which is really negligible for this kind of benefit).</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">Cosmic Awareness:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Another of those &ldquo;when you need something to work&rdquo; things, this is interesting in that you can prepare it in advance to use on whatever comes up. Gets a damn good duration with an Augment, so it can be a very potent tool of &ldquo;I just plain succeed&rdquo;.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c5">Data Transfer:</span><span>&nbsp;True Mind Switch, but it only works on AI. It also lets you move any AI friends you have into meat bodies. Expensive, a bit niche and relies on AI being in your game. If you have an AI buddy you need to move around though, this </span><span class="c9">could</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;be worth grabbing if nobody else can.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">Ethereal Passage:</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">This power allows you to make invisible, non-literal tunnels through anything made of wood, stone or plaster. If the tech level of your game means people aren&rsquo;t lead-lining their everything or making things out of metal, then this basically means you get access to anywhere you want. You can also bring your party along. Shame it is so easily countered with a bit of iron in the works.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c8">Hypercognition:</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Sherlock, please, your brain is on fire! A fantastic power literally limited to what you can think of and what the GM will allow. With this in your toolkit, you will basically know everything you ever need to know.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Selective Negation Field:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;A Null Psionics Field that follows you, but you pick the powers it affects. This one relies on you knowing that an enemy will try to use certain things on you, but if you do, this is a hard counter to them. VERY expensive in terms for PP though for your limited pool.</span></li></ul><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c25" id="h.fjrc8upgqqac"><span class="c19 c4">Archetypes</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c11 c4"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">Archetypes are significant modifications to your class that often either completely change how it plays or focus it down a specific path. They do this by removing certain class features from your character and replacing them with new ones of theoretically equal value. Unfortunately, not all archetypes are created equally, so you need to know which ones are a good deal or not. Fortunately the Cryptic is not a Paizo class but a Dreamscarred one, so we can expect at least some level of quality. The main thing to look for in archetypes are ones that trade out features that you don&rsquo;t really want and replace them with ones you do. You may also apply multiple archetypes at once, so long as they do not overlap. I have included the list of compatible combinations as part of the rating.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">The Cryptic has 10 such archetypes right now, with 2 being in playtest, but still included here.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c30 c4 c8">Brutal Disrupter</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">The Brutal Disrupter converts the Cryptic from a trapmaster into a scary melee murderer. If you don&rsquo;t want any trap expertise and want to mix it up in melee, then you have little reason not to take this. Obviously, traplords and ranged builds won&rsquo;t be too interested here.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c4">Compatible with:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Distorter, Grammaton, Ravager, Pattern Wielder and Circuitbreaker</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c4 c5">Intimidating Pattern</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(replaces </span><span class="c10 c4">Trapfinding</span><span class="c11 c4">)</span></p><p class="c13"><span>Not too good a start as you likely don&rsquo;t have the Cha for this, but at least it doesn&rsquo;t replace anything too irreplaceable. It does tie in with what you get next though, so if you do want to be scary, this will shore you up. This gets one heck of a lot better if you grab the Bruising Intellect trait</span><span>.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">Unnerving Disruption</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(replaces </span><span class="c0">Trapmaker</span><span class="c11 c4">)</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">You can expend your Focus to make a free Demoralize attempt when you deal damage with Disrupt Pattern. A neat bonus here, but again, you aren&rsquo;t too likely to have the Intimidate score to back it up.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c4 c8">Channeled Disruption</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(replaces </span><span class="c0">Swift Trapper</span><span class="c11 c4">)</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">Now, this is the whole reason you are taking this archetype. You can now channel Disrupt Pattern through every melee attack you make, specifically bypassing the 1/round limit. This is fantastic as it makes your attacks HURT and can lay debuffs like no tomorrow.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c30 c15 c4">Distorter</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">The Distorter gives up some versatility to be an expert infiltrator and spy. In the right game, the more social and intrigue based games, this is really cool, but otherwise too niche to be worth it. Still not a bad archetype though, even when you aren&rsquo;t in the social sphere.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c4">Compatible with:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Brutal Disruptor, Pattern Breaker, Lost Mind and Pattern Wielder.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c10 c4">Altered App</span><span class="c15 c4">earance</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(replaces </span><span class="c15 c4">Scribe </span><span class="c10 c4">Tattoo</span><span class="c11 c4">)</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">So long as you are focused, your face is whatever you want it to be. In social and intrigue games this is amazing and is a cool RP trick in any game. It does mean you lose out on Tattoos though.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c15 c4">Warp Perception</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(replaces </span><span class="c10 c4">4th lvl Insight</span><span class="c11 c4">)</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">This is strange, but in effect it makes enemies who fail their Will saves treat all distances going towards you as double for movement and effects, but not range or AoEs. I&rsquo;m not too sure what to make of this as it does make it hard for brawlers to get close, but it seems a bit niche to me.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c10 c4">Silent Pattern</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(replaces </span><span class="c10 c4">10th lvl Insight</span><span class="c11 c4">)</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">An at-will 10ft area Silence ability is pretty cool for sneaking around and avoiding detection. Unlike the spell it does not follow a target, so be aware of that, but it can really mess up those who need to make incantations or who like to use sound-based effects on you.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c10 c4">Blur Pattern</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(replaced </span><span class="c4 c8">Enduring Defence</span><span class="c4 c11">)</span></p><p class="c13"><span>Constant concealment as long as you maintain focus is really nice, though True Sight will punch through it (use Escape Detection if this happens). Note that while this looks like a bad trade on the ratings, it isn&rsquo;t because not all ratings exist in a void. This will really help you, both in combat and while sneaking.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c4 c8 c34">Gram</span><span class="c30 c4 c6">maton</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">For the more damage minded ranged build, the Grammaton mixes their Disrupt Pattern with the use of firearms. Being tied to firearms has varying usefulness based on the campaign, as lower availability games will make the cost of ammunition prohibitive without some workarounds and this is assuming they are allowed in the first place. Word of advice on this; get Psionic Repair for when you inevitably have to fix your gun after a misfire.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c4">Compatible with:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Brutal Disruptor, Pattern Breaker, Pattern Wielder and Circuitbreaker</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c27 c10 c4">Weapon Proficiencies</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">This wouldn&rsquo;t be much of a firearms archetype if you did not gain proficiency with them, now would it?</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c10 c4">Pattern of the Gun</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(replaces </span><span class="c10 c4">Scribe Tattoo</span><span class="c11 c4">)</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">The usual package every gun archetype gets; a battered gun, a point of Grit, a Deed to go with it and your means of making ammo. All fairly standard fare, but important fare none-the-less. I&rsquo;d go with Explosive Shot, myself, unless you are using Early firearms, in which case you want Quick Clear.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c27 c0">Disrupt Pattern Alteration</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">You may now only do Disrupt Pattern when attacking with your handgun. On the one hand, if you lose your gun or need to reload, you lose your backup plan. On the other hand, you were most likely going to be doing this anyway, even if with a Conductive enhancement on your gun, so not too much of a loss.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">Gritted Pattern</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(replaces </span><span class="c10 c4">4th lvl Insight</span><span class="c11 c4">)</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">Lose an insight but gain a Grit pool based on your Int. Grit can be useful, and will fuel your next ability, but often the Insight might have been better&hellip;.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c4 c5">Insightful Deed</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(replaces </span><span class="c10 c4">6th lvl Insight</span><span class="c11 c4">)</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">Pick a 3rd lvl or lower Deed. Not a good trade here, as the Deeds open to you do not match up to the Insight you could have got instead. Gunslinger Initiative is probably the best of a bad lot here.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c10 c4">Avoid Attacks</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(replaces </span><span class="c10 c4">7th lvl Power</span><span class="c11 c4">)</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">As much as I tend to dislike x/day abilities, the ability to give yourself full concealment is pretty neat and combos well with your stealthiness. If nothing else, it will save you precious PP on Concealing Amorphea. The uses do scale slowly though, so be sparing with them.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c4 c8">Gun Kata</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(replaces </span><span class="c10 c4">Hide in Plain Sight </span><span class="c4">part of </span><span class="c10 c4">Hidden Pattern</span><span class="c11 c4">)</span></p><p class="c13"><span>Now, this is very nice. This allows you to make a melee attack with your gun and put the basic damage (and, more importantly, effects) of Disrupt Pattern onto it, bypassing the use limit. For every attack you hit with, you get to make a free ranged attack that doesn&rsquo;t provoke against what you hit. This can pump out a lot of damage so is a very nice trick. If you do not have Bracers of Disruption when you get this, make them a priority because the +2d6 from those can apply here.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c30 c15 c4">Pattern Breaker</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">Pattern Breakers are the habitual vandals of the Cryptic world. They give up their Stealth and some versatility to become very good at breaking stuff wide open, a talent which later extends to magic effects. A fair trade all in all, albeit a bit more situational than some.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c4">Compatible with:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Distorter, Grammaton and Circuitbreaker</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c10 c4">Disable Lock</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(replaces </span><span class="c10 c4">2nd lvl Insight</span><span class="c11 c4">)</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">3+Int times per day, you can disable a lock as a standard if you make a +10 Manifester lvl check. Basically, this will nearly always succeed and can be used on magical locks (I think) so if you loath locks, this is an efficient trade. Note that this counts as an Insight for prerequisites, so you don&rsquo;t get shafted there.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c10 c4">Sunder Pattern</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(replaces </span><span class="c10 c4">Hidden Pattern</span><span class="c11 c4">)</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">Lose your stealth bonus for a bonus to Sundering.

This is only useful against armed/armoured foes with magic gear, but the ability to just disable the angry Black Knight&rsquo;s Axe of Soul Drinking for a while can be awesome. There is no limit to how many items you can have shut down at a time, but you can only do one at a time.

You make a Ranged Touch attack to do it with an increment of 10ft, but if you miss, the tattoo does not seem to be expended. This adds a hell of a lot of flexibility to your tattoos and makes them very worth it for the rest of your party.

The two available are Empower and Extend, of which Extend will be best for you. Note that the tattoo isn&rsquo;t actually expended, instead just disabled for a day, which turns your spare tattoos into free augments for your buffs.

This gives you the ability to spend PP to gain Essence for a turn, but it won&rsquo;t stack with your actual essence. This temporary Essence is capped only by receptacle and the amount of PP you can spend at a time, so you could fill everything if you wanted. At 6th lvl, you can then augment this conversion into more essence at a rate of 3PP per Essence and can actually ignore the normal Essence cap (though the ML cap means this is by 1 for a few lvls until the scaling catches up). While this means you can theoretically squeeze a load of power out of these things, remember what I have often said about your PP levels. In my opinion, while powerful, trades out WAAAAY too many insights to be a good tradeoff.

This allows you to force a foe to reroll on a check and take the latter result, though it happens in the time between the dice showing the number and the result being announced.

Keeping your manifester scaling up to speed is very good.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">Psychoportive Talent (Psionic)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;-</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Expend focus to 5ft-step as an immediate is great. Remember that an immediate used on an attack roll will kick in before the damage, so stepping out of the way of a melee attack will negate it. You can&rsquo;t do this if you have already done a 5ft-step this turn though.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c5">Perceptive Talent (Psionic) -</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;+1 trait bonus to Initiative and Sense Motive while focused could be worse if you can&rsquo;t think of anything else to take in this slot. Doesn&rsquo;t stack with other traits though.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">+1 Save Traits -</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;There are a number of these, usually in the Combat section and if nothing else catches your eye, then you could do worse than these.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c8">Reactionary (Combat) -</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;The go-to combat trait for a reason. +2 trait bonus to Initiative is fantastic, especially for you, who really need to get those debuffs on things quickly.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">Bruising Int</span><span class="c4 c8">ellect (Social) -</span><span>&nbsp;If you are wanting to intimidate, then this is how you are going to get around the Charisma problem. Brutal Disrupters ADORE this.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c15 c4">Clever Wordplay (Social) -</span><span>&nbsp;Get better at disguising by making it key off Int. Some of you will really like this, though Disguise is easy to boost and your Social slot has fierce competition.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">Pragmatic Activator (Magic) -</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;If you are grabbing tattoos from off-list sources, then you will need to make a Use Magic Device check to use them. Making that key off Int is brilliant for you and the bonus doesn&rsquo;t hurt either.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c8">Spark of Crea</span><span class="c4 c5">tion (Magic) -</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;If you are crafting stuff a lot (I&rsquo;m looking at you, Circuitbreakers) then a straight 5% reduction to crafting costs will save you a lot of money. Crafters WILL take this, while others will have no need. This is better than Hedge Magician because this gives a boost to the skill roll.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c8">Heirloom Wea</span><span class="c4 c6">pon (Equipment)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;-</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;This one is hard to rate because of Paizo&rsquo;s pointless nerfing of it. If you can take the pre-nerf version, like many GMs allow, this will give you a MW Weapon, proficiency in it and a +1 to attacks when using it. This is really good, especially for you weapon users who want better toys. If you can only use the nerfed version, this sucks.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">Trapfinding (Campaign) -</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Not all games allow these powerful traits, but if you are taking an archetype that trades out this feature, getting it back for a trait is a really nice deal. Also, try not to trip on the Rogue&rsquo;s fetid corpse while you are here. It has cooties. Paizo cooties.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c8 c43">Finding your Kin (Campaign)</span><span class="c4 c8">&nbsp;-</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Be careful using this as nothing prompts a wary GM to throw books at you at chargen than this. A hit point and a skill point, for free, every level AND easier multiclassing is obscene and would blow most FEATS out of the water, nevermind traits. If you are allowed this, take it. If not, then don&rsquo;t grumble too much as it was iffy anyway.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">Student of Philosophy (social) -</span><span class="c4 c33">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Works only with some uses of Bluff and Diplomacy (But feint, secret messages and getting information are very situational), but &nbsp;you get Int to lie and to convince people. If you ever lack a party face pure logic will get you out of trouble. (and help you dump more Charisma)</span></li><li class="c2 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1"></span></li></ul><p class="c22 c17"><span class="c29 c4"></span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c4 c29">Feats</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">There are way, way, waaaay too many feats for me to go over them all so I shall only go over the ones you&rsquo;ll be interested in. This section will be added to from time to time, so any suggestions here will be well received.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c11 c4"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c11 c4">Psionic feats</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">This is the section that will contain any feats that run of your main class features, but there are a few in here that are just obscenely useful on their own.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c27 c0"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">Improved </span><span class="c10 c4">Disruption:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;A small boost to your disrupt damage isn&rsquo;t too much to write home about. Gets better for those of you who are throwing out loads of Disrupts a turn through whatever means.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c10 c4">Extra Insight:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Some insights are very good and you may not have enough to get everything you want.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c10 c4">Extra Disruption Type:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Personally, I&rsquo;d prefer to have Discerning Pattern, but if you have something else eating your swifts, then this can be good.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c10 c4">Psicrystal Affinity:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;The gateway to one of your methods of getting 2 focuses, I much prefer this one as it gives you a sort of familiar that comes with a whole load of benefits that will aid your scouting.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13 c26"><span class="c4 c8">Psicrystal Containment: </span><span class="c1">Place a focus in your Psicrystal so you have a second one to spend. Always good, either so you can spend and maintain, or so you can spend two at once.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">Psionic Body: </span><span class="c1">Get 2 HP for every Psionic feat you take, including this one. Required for Deep Focus, so you will end up with at least 4HP from here, 6 if you keep your Tattoos. The more Psionic feats you take the better this gets as they can add up.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13 c26"><span class="c4 c8">Deep Focus: </span><span class="c1">Your other way of getting a second focus, this one requires Psionic Body so it will be more suited to brawlers than scouts.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c10 c4">One Pattern:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Converts the off-type penalty into normal damage and gives you a bonus when you disrupt the correct type. Again, the boost isn&rsquo;t too much, but it does mean you never have to worry about types again. Hungry on the Skill points though, but you&rsquo;ll be taking those anyway.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c4 c8">Psionic Meditation:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Requires 13 Wis, but is mandatory if you have ANYTHING that requires you to spend focus.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c4 c8">Unlocked Talent:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Gain some extra PP and an extra 1st lvl power. This is a great deal as it is effectively 2 feats in one.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c10 c4">Extra Power Known:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;There are a lot of powers you will want, so this can help you increase the breadth of your toolset. Remember that when using this you must be more harsh in your judgements due to the cost.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c10 c4">Open Minded:</span><span>&nbsp;An extra skill point every level will be helpful to you as a skillmonkey can never have enough skills going.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c11 c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c11 c4">Metapsionic feats</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">These work by altering your powers sort of like an Augment. They also require you to expend your focus, so you can at most have 2 of these active on a single use of a power.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c4 c6">Burning Power:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;I am mentioning a couple of these as notable traps for you, starting here. Your real tricks have nearly nothing to do with direct damage, and adding at most 12 damage to an attack delayed by a round is pretty much never going to be worth it. Plus fire damage.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c4 c5">Burrowing Power:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Corner cases will like this, but very often the ones wanting to use it won&rsquo;t need it. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c4 c5">Chain Power:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Again, direct damage isn&rsquo;t your thing unless you&rsquo;re going WAY out of your way for it.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c4 c5">Concussive Power:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;You have no native sonic damage powers. If you learn one somehow, this is a decent pick for stacking up some extra penalties on top of the many that you are already dishing out.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c4 c5">Dazing Power:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Daze, while a pretty nice debuff to land, can&rsquo;t really be delivered through any of your powers.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c10 c4">Delay Power</span><span class="c10">:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;If you can plan ahead on this, it can allow you to frontload your buffs to kick in right at the start of combat. Can get expensive though.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c10 c4">Echoing </span><span class="c4 c36">Power</span><span class="c1">: A lot of your powers are utility you may be using quite often, so being able to save PP by doubling up on them can very often be worth it.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c4 c5">Ectoplasmic Power</span><span class="c5">:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Much of what you do really doesn&rsquo;t care whether your opponent is incorporeal or ethereal as it doesn&rsquo;t directly affect them too much.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c4 c33">Empower Power</span><span class="c1">: You again don&rsquo;t really specialize in the kinds of abilities this is made to assist.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c4 c33">Enlarge Power</span><span class="c1">: You don&rsquo;t really have the powers to benefit from this.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c4 c33">Explosive Power</span><span class="c1">: Once again, only works on damaging powers, but it interacts strangely with powers that are fully negated on a successful save&hellip; strangely as in changing Will Negates to Reflex Half by aiming at a mouse standing next to them.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c10 c4">Extend Power</span><span class="c1">: Assisting your many buffs and making sure your debuff powers put an opponent out of the fight for good are both noble goals, and the augment cost is cheap.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c4 c6">Flaring Power</span><span class="c1">: Requires you to blow Focus on a power type you really don&rsquo;t have for a mediocre benefit. Pass, even if the effect is no-save.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c4 c33">Focused Power</span><span class="c1">: You don&rsquo;t really have to powers to make this work.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c4 c8 c32">HUSTLE POWER</span><span class="c1">: Had to highlight this one. Hustling a power is in most cases actively better than Quickening it, since your Move action is the one most often open rather than your Swift. If you intend to manifest in combat, this feat is not optional.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c4 c6">Lingering Power</span><span class="c6">: </span><span class="c1">Not a common power type for you, and very little benefit. Not worth the feat, even if you had spares to burn (which you don&rsquo;t)</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c4 c5">Maximize Power</span><span class="c5">:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Random numeric variables are not on many of your powers, and on most of those you would really prefer to augment those four points.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c4 c33">Merciful Power</span><span class="c1">: Blow people&rsquo;s minds up&hellip; mercifully! If you are in the kind of game where you like bringing people in alive (perhaps to torture for information later with your incredible Intimidate), this can come in handy.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c4 c6">Metapsionic</span><span class="c4 c33">&nbsp;Mastery</span><span class="c1">: If you are very caster-style, this can let you do all kinds of unpleasant things with your Powers. Otherwise, skip it as the waste it is.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c4 c5">Opportunity Power</span><span class="c5">:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;One big problem: Touch-range powers only. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c4 c5">Persistent Power</span><span class="c5">:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;You don&rsquo;t have much that makes use of this, so probably not worth it to you.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c4 c33">Piercing Power</span><span class="c1">: Not normally going to be worthwhile&hellip; but if you are heavily powers-based this will let you knock out one line of resistance</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c4 c33">Quicken Power</span><span class="c1">: Hard on the PP reserve, but the wording of this one is a bit odd. Unlike Quicken Spell, this won&rsquo;t eat your Swift action. It just lets you manifest it. Theoretically, you could get three powers in a round off by using two Psionic Foci along with this and Hustle power alongside your Standard, for some crazy buff nova potential. Most DMs are going to treat it as a Swift, though, so be prepared for that&hellip; or thrown books after you take ten minutes to resolve one turn of combat.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c4 c5">Redirect Power</span><span class="c5">:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;I&rsquo;d personally rather by far use the focus on something that makes the power better, instead of less bad. Make sense?</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c4 c5">Rime Power</span><span class="c5">:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Has to deal cold DAMAGE. In the event of you gaining common access to a power with that description, this becomes a mid-duration Entangle with no save. Shame you don&rsquo;t have any damagers</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c4 c6">Selective Power: </span><span class="c1">You don&rsquo;t have the kind of powers that make this necessary.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c10 c4">Shared Power</span><span class="c1">: A quite a few of your powers are self-only buffs so sharing them out can be very nice. This feat is definitely worth considering.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c4 c5">Sickening Power</span><span class="c5">:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Targets Fortitude, which is unfortunate. Sickened is a great way to take opponents out of the fight, but you have few ways to deliver it and have other sources of debuffs.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c4 c6">Thundering Power</span><span class="c1">: Deafened is not a very good status effect. Pass.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c4 c6">Toppling Power</span><span class="c1">: Multiple points of failure, not even counting your lack of Force Damage powers, makes this a waste of both your Focus and a feat slot.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c4 c5">Twin Power</span><span class="c5">:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;You don&rsquo;t have many powers this actually works with, so it isn&rsquo;t much worth your while.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c15 c4">Unconditional Power</span><span class="c15">: </span><span class="c1">This, while you&rsquo;d probably rather it never come up, it is quite possibly won&rsquo;t, can save your arse when you really need to get a buff or emergency teleport off.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c4 c33">Widen Power</span><span class="c1">: Useful in crowds, but you don&rsquo;t have much that benefits from this</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c4">Path of War feats</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">Path of War is Dreamscarred Press&rsquo; take on Martials, as inspired by the divisive 3.5 book Tome of Battle. The way it works is by making a new system of abilities that once used must be manually refreshed mid-battle. While this has little to do with you by default, it does have some very nice feat support you should consider, including ways to grab these powerful techniques.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c10 c4">Martial Trainin</span><span class="c4 c8">g 1-5 -</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;This is a way for you to spend feats to dabble in the Martial. The usefulness of this will vary between cool and amazing by build; those who rely on Disrupt won&rsquo;t get as much, while weapon users and Gramattons will find things far more appealing. It takes you 2 of these feats to get your first stance, and many of you may want to stop there, which will net you 3 maneuvers. I won&rsquo;t go into too much detail here, but I will point out the main disciplines you&rsquo;ll find interesting, who will like them and why. The scaling on these is based on half you lvl + the initiator stat, which is determined by the assigned skill of the discipline, which I shall mark separately for you.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13 c26"><span class="c10 c4">Solar Wind (Ranged</span><span class="c4 c8">&nbsp;and Grammattons) -</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Perception (Wisdom)</span><span>&nbsp;-</span><span class="c1">The big draw here is for you Gramattons, as the 1st lvl Phantom Sun Stance makes your expensive ammo problems vanish into the wind and if you don&rsquo;t have such concerns, a bit of extra damage on each hit won&rsquo;t go amiss. As for the maneuvers, it mostly focuses around damaging ranged shots and counters for shooting down other ranged shots.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13 c26"><span class="c10 c4">Sleeping Goddess</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;-</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Autohypnosis (Wisdom) </span><span class="c4">-</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Interesting because of its effect of granting extra PP, feats in this will help you fuel your powers better just by having them. Their 1st lvl stances helpfully scale with you as you lvl, albeit slower than the actual initiatior&rsquo;s version, providing either ease of movement which eventually becomes wall walking and flight, or a flexible scaling bonus to AC, Attacks or CMB/CMD. The Maneuvers for this are very varied, so it best you check them out yourself.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13 c26"><span class="c10 c4">Primal Fury</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;-</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Survival (Wisdom)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;-</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;The one you 2handed weapon users will enjoy, this is all about hitting things hard in the face. Also get Scent and improved movement speed as a 1st lvl stance.</span></p><p class="c3 c26"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13 c26"><span class="c10 c4">Thrashing Dragon/Broken Blade</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">-</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c10 c4">Acrobatics (Dexterity) </span><span class="c4">-</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Designed for TWFers and Natural Weapon users respectively, these are all about landing as many attacks as they can. Their stances provide a choice of attack or defence, while their maneuvers are all about hitting hard with several blows.</span></p><p class="c3 c26"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13 c26"><span class="c10 c4">Veiled Moon</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;- </span><span class="c10 c4">Stealth (Dexterity)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;-</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;The strange one, Veiled Moon is about utility and mobility a lot of the time, with it&rsquo;s offence being swift and dirty. This suits you perfectly, as you do this stuff anyway. It&rsquo;s lvl 1 stances are either an AC and Reflect boost or Scent and the ability to sense the Astral Plane. Again, the sort of stuff you already like to do.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c10 c4">Deadly Agility -</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;For those of you who can&rsquo;t get Nimble on your Dex weapon for whatever reason. I dislike this as a tax, but it can be very very important to take. Obviously Str builds won&rsquo;t be interested.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c10 c4">Defensive Expertise -</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;If you grabbed a Shield, the ability to add it&rsquo;s bonus to Touch AC and Reflex is pretty damn nice.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c11 c4">Bloodforge feats</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">Bloodforge feats usually relate to your racial types, granting new and powerful abilities based on what you are. Because of these, you should take note of what types and subtypes you get for picking a certain race.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c10 c4">Mixed Blood</span><span class="c1">: Starting this a bit out of alphabetical order, since this will often be required to take before going into any of the others. Several subtypes give very potent bonuses, such as Low Light or Darkvision, Scent, and resistances. Some give skill bonuses and movement modes, which can help. Others (such as the Alignment and Dwarf subtypes) should be avoided at all costs unless they are absolutely required in order to acquire something you need later. I will be factoring the value of your required Mixed Blood into the value of the feats that require them.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c10 c4">Vestigial/Aerial Wings</span><span class="c1">: While there are other ways to get this instead of sinking 2-3 feats into it (most commonly Wings of Flying), Flight with good speed and Good maneuverability, plus Fly as a class skill, is not to be discounted. The subtypes accessing this include several good ones, so you aren&rsquo;t wasting the Mixed Blood to get in</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c4 c33">Ancestor&rsquo;s Breath</span><span class="c1">: A decent way to clear out the little distractions after landing your nasty debuffs on their boss, there are better uses for a feat.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c10 c4">Blood Frenzy</span><span class="c1">: The bonus has no cap. Any big boss that decides to bring minions is going to have a VERY bad day on his hands. This goes down in value considerable if your encounters tend to be in ones and twos, but that is very campaign-dependent (and in that case, you can usually lock them out of most actions anyway)</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c4 c5">Feral </span><span class="c10 c4">Fighter:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Useless to a lot of people but for Natural Weapon users, this can help you shore up your number of attacks if your race doesn&rsquo;t get enough of them.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c10 c4">Hold Prey/Inst</span><span class="c4 c5">inctive Grapple:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;You Natural Weapon users may well enjoy this, but it will be worthless for others. Lost Minds should note that their Form of Doom gives them Tentacles.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c10 c4">Mighty Frame</span><span class="c1">: If physical damage is your game and you don&rsquo;t already have Powerful Build, you have no reason whatsoever to pass this one up. Easy to get into the subtypes, and if you need a feat to do it then several give good bonuses from Mixed Blood</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c10 c4">Overflowing Life</span><span class="c1">: Never rely on this in-combat, but having the ability to start things off at full health reliably throughout even the worst adventuring day is important for someone who will be drawing as much incoming hatred as you. Less critical if you have a good source of out-of-combat healing, or if you generally stick to short adventuring days (or if you are a Grendle, since they recover quickly anyway).</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">Small Stature:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Decent if Stealthy is your goal, but being able to use downsized weapons without penalty is rarely going to be a big benefit (other than, again, being easier to hide). It is very rare for smaller to be better in this game, since this does not affect AC or attack rolls. Better on a Shadow Hunter, since that&rsquo;s more up your alley.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c4 c33">Woeful Stench</span><span class="c1">: VERY easy entry, and Sickened is a fight-ender&hellip; but this does not exclude allies and targets the save that is traditionally highest on your opponents. Plus, you are unlike to have the Con to get the most out of this.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c11 c4">Paizo feats</span></p><p class="c14" id="h.l3ptnrff2nrt"><span class="c1">The feats in the base rulebooks vary wildly in quality and are vast in quantity. You will want many of these, if only because they are taxes that gate the things you want to do. Some GMs like to give certain tax feats for free, so makes sure to inquire with your GM about what breaks they are willing to give you..</span></p><p class="c14" id="h.mxnh5hewzqvy"><span class="c10 c4">Power Attack, Piranha Strike, and Deadly Aim:</span><span>&nbsp;Same thing for different weapons, but very nice to have. If you expect to be able to use it, grab one. Then again, if you prefer more accuracy, you could decide against it</span><span>.</span></p><p class="c14" id="h.k3vb8eohb1yu"><span class="c4 c5">Cornugon Smash:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Unlike most, you won&rsquo;t need this as Brutal Disrupter has this covered and they are the ones who are likely to try this.</span></p><p class="c14" id="h.wccsmhdeih61"><span class="c4 c8">Point Blank Shot (series):</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re into ranged combat, take these and don&rsquo;t look back. Get, at the very least, PBS and Precise Shot. Basically required for ranged weapon builds, but it does make it expensive.</span></p><p class="c14" id="h.qe4yujhffq1i"><span class="c10 c4">Improved Initiative:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;A classic standby, and still very nice to have. Acting first to put on a buff to start laying out your debuffs can really help</span></p><p class="c14" id="h.z9wasby47m3k"><span class="c10 c4">Two-Weapon Fighting Series:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;TWFing is laden with penalties and you will want these to get rid of them. Still seems like way too many feats though, so ask if your GM is reasonable and is willing to let you convert the core line into a single scaling feat.</span></p><p class="c14" id="h.q0wdto2sg065"><span class="c10 c4">Improved/Gr</span><span class="c4 c5">eater Sunder:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Pattern Breakers want this as this is their jam.

Otherwise, probably not your thing.</span></p><p class="c14" id="h.jpxntm8h1u8f"><span class="c4 c8">Multiattack: </span><span class="c1">Removing some of the penalties on your secondary Natural Weapons will help you land more blows. If you like such things, you want this.</span></p><p class="c14" id="h.twnyusx861na"><span class="c0">Shield Proficiency/Medium Armour Proficiency:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">If you want a bit of extra AC, then these are alright options, but remember that the non-proficiency penalties vanish if there is no ACP, which is obscenely easy to do with Mithral.</span></p><p class="c14" id="h.klz7yaiwioen"><span class="c10 c4">Extra Traits -</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;A lot of traits are really nice and you have a limited number of them by default. This feat gets you 2 more. Remember the usual restrictions on traits though.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c25" id="h.pfdxsoiqxjho"><span class="c19 c4">Equipment (ongoing)</span></h2><p class="c13"><span class="c1">Ah, equipment; all that shiny useful stuff you will rely upon during your career. There is a hell of a lot of stuff to choose from, so it can be somewhat daunting to make decisions on what to buy or craft. With that in mind, I&rsquo;ll do my best to at least point out the must-haves. Beyond that, games vary far too much for me to be able to tell you what you are likely to want.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">This section will continue to grow, but it would still be appreciated if any of you commenters could chip in with your own suggestions on such matters.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c11 c4">Weapons</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">You don&rsquo;t get much in weapon proficiency, but you do have a few nice things. There are loads of magic weapon enhancements around so I&rsquo;m just going to list the ones you&rsquo;ll be actually interested in. Expect this list to grow and please feel free to suggest additions.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">Ranged builds are actually not too likely to be using weapons as Disrupt Pattern will do it all for you. Exceptions to this are the Grammaton and those who send Disrupt through a weapon via Conductive. Even so, you may want a light melee weapon on hand, just in case.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">Str builds will want to take a race that either grants Natural Weapons or more suitable weapon proficiencies. By default, the best you get for Str weapons are the Spear and Longspear.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">Melee Dex builds have a few more options as they can take a Rapier. You are best served with lots of attacks though, so Natural weapons or an off-hand Dagger or Sickle to TWF with will be your better options.</span></p><ul class="c18 lst-kix_uvtyb1wz2o86-0 start"><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c8">Basic Enhancement</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">- Basically a necessity, you want this.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c8">Amulet of Mighty Fists</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">- For those who use Natural Weapons, there is this daftly expensive tool that you WILL be getting none-the-less. This costs way more than it should (though some GMs lower it), but it does apply to all of your Natural Weapons. As such, to make this worth doing, you will want a LOT of natural weapons, though you will want those anyway if you are going this direction. Remember that this can gain properties like a weapon.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">Nimble</span><span class="c10 c4">&nbsp;- +1</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;- Getting Dex to your damage on your weapons is going to serve a lot of you well, but Str build can safely ignore this. For stupid reasons, you can&rsquo;t get this on your Rapier.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">Conducti</span><span class="c4 c5">ve - +1</span><span>&nbsp;- This one is interesting because it allows you to send your Disrupt Pattern through a weapon. It is only once per round, but then, you can only use it once per round. This limitation can make Vital Strike an interesting consideration, though. Consider sticking it on a Bow to apply some damage and an accuracy and range boost to your Disrupt Pattern. Brutal Disrupters don&rsquo;t need this and Gramattons can safely skip it too.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">Seeking - +1</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;- &nbsp;For you Ranged builds, the ability to ignore concealment is quite a boon.</span></li><li class="c2 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1"></span></li></ul><p class="c3"><span class="c11 c4"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c11 c4">Armour</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">You only get Light Armour on your own, along with no shields. As such, at start you are generally going to want a MW Studded Leather then upgrade to a Mithral Chainshirt. If you have huge amounts of Dex, then you would be better served by a Silken Ceremonial Armour as it has no Dex bonus limit. If you have less Dex, then you may want to get Prof in Medium Armour and go with a Mithral Breastplate.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">Getting a buckler can be worth your while and has little penalty as just making it Masterwork removes any non proficiency penalties it had.</span></p><ul class="c18 lst-kix_9wvyo2t744nt-0 start"><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c8">Enhancement Bonus</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;- Yeah, you are going to want this, just like everyone else ever.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c4">Comfort - 5000</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;- I love this one as it is cheap, does not eat into your Enhancement, lowers the ACP by another point (This on a Mithral Breastplate means no non-prof penalties) and shows you enjoy personal hygiene.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4">Fortification - </span><span class="c10 c4">Light (+1),</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c15 c4">Medium (+3)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c4 c5">Heavy (+5)</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;- Negating Crits and Sneak Attacks is always nice and you don&rsquo;t have the HP to be tanking them. Unfortunately, these get too expensive to be worth it as they go up, so stick to the Light one. If you get yourself a shield, get it on that too.</span></li><li class="c2 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1"></span></li></ul><p class="c3"><span class="c11 c4"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c11 c4">Slotted Wondrous Items</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">These are some of your most important items as they can give boosts where nothing else does.
