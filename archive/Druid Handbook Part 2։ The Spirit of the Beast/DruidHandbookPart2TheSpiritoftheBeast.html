Their previously premiere ability has been seriously powered down, leaving them with only a free beast shape, plant shape and elemental body spells as spell like abilities, the unique opportunity to gain the ability to cast in these forms, primary casting, animal companion or domain option, good skills, good saves, decent HP, some nice skill bonuses, Wild empathy, woodland stride, trackless step, resist natures lure, poison immunity, alter self at will, and resistance to aging effects.&nbsp; Yep, Druids have it hard.</span></p><p class="c1 c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is however completely legitimate to wonder what niche the Pathfinder Druid should be filling in your party, and whether melee is still an option, how these changes have effected their ability score purchase, and whether they should stick with animal companion, or jump on the domain train.&nbsp; These are the points we will be discussing, along with all the Druid abilities, and we will determine which options are good options, and what should be avoided.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Druids have so many abilities, but it can be difficult to know how to use them together to create an effective whole.&nbsp; What does your Druid do with Wildshape in Pathfinder?&nbsp; How does this work with spellcasting?&nbsp; What should be done with a Druids ability scores?&nbsp; Another perplexing question is which Nature Bond to choose?&nbsp; The choice will largely effect what your character can do well, and what they can&#39;t.&nbsp; Not a decision to take lightly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is chapter 2 of a 3 chapter series.&nbsp; In this Chapter we will discuss the Druid type I&#39;ve named, &quot;The Spirit of the Beast&quot;, this build is specifically made for melee combat.&nbsp; Yes, he can still cast, but the numbers simply don&#39;t allow him to cast effectively like the Wild Mystic.&nbsp; Not enough castings, not high enough DC&#39;s, and the feats aren&#39;t there.&nbsp; However, casting remains a vital part of the whole.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Finally, we need to discuss tactics.&nbsp; The Druidic tactics from 3.5 will not work in Pathfinder, so Pathfinder Druids must find new tactics to coordinate a large number of very nice abilities to actually contribute in a meaningful way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c19 c5 c2"><a class="c14" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid%3D0AcNyxDTKvAmqZGRtZzhzdjZfNDZnNHpzcmdodA%26hl%3Den&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611517391045000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3t2pJL1nJv1ClC0LrFWpEN">Chapter 1: The Wild Mystic</a></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c2 c19"><a class="c14" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid%3D0AcNyxDTKvAmqZGRtZzhzdjZfNDlmZ3Y2YjNjdA%26hl%3Den&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611517391045000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3U7J23xQxXvNsfYTcGyfZv">Chapter 3: Druid Spells examined</a></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c2">Colour Coding the Guide:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In this guide I will be Colour Coding your various options to provide opinion on each.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2 c9">Red:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Warning.&nbsp; This is a poor option and should be avoided.&nbsp; For spells, simply don&#39;t expect to ever memorize these.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c8 c2">Orange</span><span class="c0">: This is an OK option.&nbsp; I&#39;m not recommending it, but it&#39;s not bad.&nbsp; For spells, not an everyday memorization, but in the right circu\mstance, good to have.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2 c3">Green:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I recommend this option.&nbsp; It is a strong choice.&nbsp; For spells, this is a worthy memorization option.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2 c15">Blue</span><span class="c0">: A must have.&nbsp; Your best possible option.&nbsp; For spells, this would be a &quot;must have&quot; memorization in my opinion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c2">The Druid Class Abilities:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c2">Nature Sense:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;A simple bonus to two class skills.&nbsp; Nature Sense is gained at level 1 and provides an untyped +2 bonus to Knowledge (Nature) and Survival.&nbsp; As we will see later, the former is a very important skill for Druids, so this bonus is welcome.&nbsp; Certainly both skills are very flavor appropriate for the class.&nbsp; Not a flashy power, but as a free bonus, we will gladly take it.&nbsp; We may not be able to afford ranks in Survival, but if we can do at least one level to kick in the Class bonus, we&#39;ll do that at least.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">Wild Empathy:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;This is basically like getting a skill maxed out for free.&nbsp; Wild Empathy, gained at level 1, is diplomacy for animals.&nbsp; The Druid uses his class level plus his CHA bonus as the base, plus d20 for improving the attitudes of animals.&nbsp; Cha is not going to be a strong ability for your Druid, and there is no &quot;Class Skill&quot; bonus, so you will hardly be Dr. Doolittle.&nbsp; An appropriate skill for the class, and certainly worth a try when confronted with potentially noisy guard dogs, or similar situations.&nbsp; Don&#39;t expect miracles though.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c2">Woodland Stride:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;At level 2, this provides the Druid the ability to move through overgrown terrain without hinderment.&nbsp; This is important, as it essentially gives the ability to move through natural difficult terrain without penalty, allows 5&#39; steps and all that good stuff.&nbsp; Personally, I&#39;ve found natural difficult terrain comes up a reasonable amount of times through a campaign, so although this remains circumstantial, you will likely benefit from it a couple times.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c2">Trackless Step:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;At 3rd level the Druid leaves no trail and cannot be tracked.&nbsp; This is like a Pass Without Trace spell on all the time.&nbsp; Note that there is no contested roll with the tracker, it&#39;s just total immunity.&nbsp; The 20th level Ranger can&#39;t hope to track the 3rd level Druid.&nbsp; Not going to come up a lot, but worthy to note, if it does, it will work.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c2">Resist Nature&#39;s Lure:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;At level 4 this ability gives a +4 bonus to save against the supernatural or spell-like abilities of fey.&nbsp; Yep, sounds just as circumstantial as it is.&nbsp; I think in 80% of campaigns this will never see use.&nbsp; No big deal, it&#39;s a minor ability.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c2">Venom Immunity:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;At 9th level the Druid gets total immunity from poison.&nbsp; Not a bonus to save, total immunity.&nbsp; A Periapt of Proof against poison costs 27,000 gp and takes up a magic item slot.&nbsp; Druids get the ability for free while still in single digit levels.&nbsp; This is a big deal.&nbsp; Also note, the &quot;Use Poison&quot; ability would now be completely redundant to you.&nbsp; Use poison all you want, and if you accidentally poison yourself, who cares?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c2">A thousand Faces:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The Druid can change their appearance at will by 13th level as if using the Alter Self spell.&nbsp; Note that we are not talking about the disguise self spell here, Alter Self provides real changes with real bonuses.&nbsp; A 13th level human Druid can simply choose to be in Dwarf form, gaining permanent Darkvision and a +2 Size bonus to Str, or a Gnome to get permanent Low Light vision, small size, and a +2 size bonus to Dex, or switch back and forth, or take another form.&nbsp; This is a lgood power.&nbsp; Note that you cannot use it in conjunction with Wildshape.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c2">Timeless Body:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;You gain none of the negative effects of aging by 15th level.&nbsp; Aging doesn&#39;t come up in a lot of campaigns, though you can choose to be of different age in some campaigns (Check with your DM.)&nbsp; Specifically the Wild Mystic might benefit from being slightly older, taking some small penalties to physical stats while boosting Wisdom (and CHA and Int), however, note that Timeless body won&#39;t make previous penalties dissapear, it will prevent any new penalties.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c2">Ability Scores</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When we discuss ability scores for the Spirit of the Beast, we must remember the Wildshape ability.&nbsp; Go ahead, peek ahead at Wildshape if you like, as I will discuss these matters again there.&nbsp; Before you get Wildshape your physical stats will be important because you will need to enter melee without wildshape.&nbsp; Once you get Wildshape, those abilities maintain their importance, because you will be using them as a base for your wildshape statistics.&nbsp; The Spirit of the Beast must be a warrior first, and caster second, and this becomes more apparent than ever when we set our ability scores.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Being a warrior, Strength has to be your first priority.&nbsp; If you cannot back up your attacks with a significant bonus to hit and damage, you will find your offense lacking, and this should be the selling feature of the Spirit of the Beast.&nbsp; Dex and Con are also important, for initiative and defense, but both take a backseat to Strength.&nbsp; Wisdom too, cannot be ignored, because although you do not focus on casting, you need a decent wisdom to do it at all.&nbsp; In fact, this becomes a serious balancing act for the entire build.&nbsp; I would love to say not do dump Int or Cha, but this is a very ability dependant build, and that may be luxury you simply cannot afford.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My attribute strategy would go like this.&nbsp; Buy Strength last.&nbsp; Start by dumping Cha entirely.&nbsp; Dump Int too, but maybe an 8 will do.&nbsp; Then move to Wisdom, this is delicate, but a 13 will cover you for 6 levels of casting, and a wisdom boost headband can get you the other 6 levels you need for 9th level spells.&nbsp; Even a +2 headband gets you through to level 9.&nbsp; Con and Dex need a 13 at least, in a higher point buy, I would go for 14.&nbsp; Then whatever I have left goes into Str.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>So the order of ability priority ends up being: </span><span class="c2 c15">Str</span><span>, </span><span class="c2 c3">Dex</span><span>, </span><span class="c2 c3">Con</span><span>,</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c3">Wis</span><span>, </span><span class="c2 c9">Int</span><span>, </span><span class="c2 c9">Cha</span><span class="c0">.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If it was my 15 point buy, before Racial Modifiers, my Spirit of the Beast would have an ability array that looked something like this:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Str</span><span>: 16 (10), </span><span class="c2">Dex:</span><span>&nbsp;14 (5), </span><span class="c2">Con:</span><span>&nbsp;13 (3), </span><span class="c2">Int:</span><span>&nbsp;8 (-2), </span><span class="c2">Cha:</span><span>&nbsp;7 (-4), </span><span class="c2">Wis:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;13 (3)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That Strength is just that important that we need to make sure it is going to give us the advantage we need in combat.&nbsp; Wildshape will give your strength a boost, but if you don&#39;t start with an impressive Strength off the bat, you will find your combat ability unimpressive, and that&#39;s kind of the whole point of the Spirit of the Beast.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c2">Race</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The most important thing in considering Race for this build is Strength.&nbsp; There is no race with set ability scores that grants a bonus to Strength.&nbsp; This makes all these choices less than optimal (yes, they are all still workable, but it&#39;s harder).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Also, we must remember that bonuses like Low Light Vision and Darkvision are of less value.&nbsp; With Wildshape, we will be taking on the sensory ability of the animal/elemental/plant form, and give up our racial sensory type.&nbsp; Also, once we can Alter Self at will, we can just stay in a form that grants Darkvision or Low Light vision whenever we want it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2 c15">Human:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Far and away your best choice.&nbsp; The flexible ability bonus can be put into Str, and you don&#39;t have to worry about any ability penalties.&nbsp; Things like lack of special sensory ability means less to a Druid than any other class, and the extra Skill point and Feat will both be of incredible value.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2 c3">Half-Orc:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;A decent choice for the Spirit of the Beast.&nbsp; You can put that flexible stat bonus into Strength, and the Orc Ferocity works well with a class that can heal itself as a standard action.&nbsp; The Darkvision is going to be helpful only really in the early levels, as are the weapon proficiencies, so this isn&#39;t nearly as nice a choice as the human, but still decent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2 c3">Half-Elf:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The only real other &quot;optimal&quot; choice is the Half-Elf because it too can put the stat bonus into Strength.&nbsp; The racial abilities really aren&#39;t doing you much good.&nbsp; Skill Focus is always handy to have, but wasn&#39;t going to be a primary feat choice, and you are not likely to multiclass either.&nbsp; Strictly inferior to the human, and probably inferior to the Half Orc as well (though it&#39;s close), however, if you don&#39;t want to be human, this is an OK choice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c8 c2">The others:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The other races are poorer choices as you won&#39;t get a bonus to Strength.&nbsp; Obviously this makes the Gnome and Halfling especially poor choices indeed.&nbsp; However, these choices can all be made to work with this build, but you face an uphill battle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c7">Feats</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As a Spirit of the Beast, your feats will be a little spread thin.&nbsp; Spellcasting is not your focus, but you may very well want Augment Summoning anyways, however, that is a two feat investment, so I wouldn&#39;t put it first on your list.&nbsp; Instead you need some feats that are going to aid you in combat, as that is going to be your primary focus.&nbsp; Natural Spell is going to be an absolute must at level 5, as you can expect to be Wildshaped most of the time as soon as it becomes available.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">Power Attack:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;for a penalty to attack you gain a bonus to damage of twice the amount.&nbsp; Note that for Wildshapes where you have a single natural attack you will get triple the to hit penalty as a damage bonus, and for Wildshapes with a secondary attack, the trade is even.&nbsp; This is not always a feat you will want to use, it will depend on your chance to hit in any particular combat, but since you will not be using an attack with the continuous -5 on each subsequent attack, you can actually benefit more from this than fighters can.&nbsp; Also, it opens the door to some nice other feats.&nbsp; Worth taking.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">Cleave:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;A great feat for skirmishing, which is something you definitely want to do.&nbsp; If you are Wildshaped into a form with a single tough attack, then Cleave is especially tough.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">Vital Strike:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Also a great skirmish feat, and again very nice with the single attack Wildshape forms.&nbsp; These creatures can have a lot of base dice for damage, which benefit more from Vital Strike than the Greatsword wielding Fighter.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">Improved Vital Strike:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Like Vital Strike, this is a feat that shines for Druids.&nbsp; Often Wildshaping into creatures with several dice of base damage, tripling those dice can bring quite amazing results.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c2">Improved Unarmed Strike:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Useless for you (natural attacks are treated as armed attacks), except to qualify for other feats, which aren&#39;t so useless.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c2">Improved Grapple:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;You will often be Wildshaped into creatures as big as Huge, with Strength size modifiers of +6 or so, and able to Grapple for free with a successful attack (as per the grab ability).&nbsp; This is basically for the +2 and for the next step up the chain.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">Greater Grapple:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Just a way to really take advantage of Wildshaping with the Grab ability.&nbsp; Pin the creature, then rip it&#39;s throat out.&nbsp; You have a 3/4 BAB, but with bonuses for Size and Strength, you can make up for that and be a very good grappler indeed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c2">Spell Focus (Conjuration):</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Not a high priority out of the gate, but eventually you may want to invest in this if you want Augment Summoning.&nbsp; Augment Summoning isn&#39;t a must have for the Spirit of the Beast, but you will still be doing a fair bit of summoning, and the bonuses Augment gives are nice to have.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">Augment Summoning:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;This feat improves your summons significantly.&nbsp; A +4 Str bonus isn&#39;t just a damage boost, it&#39;s also a +2 to hit, and that&#39;s on every attack the creature has.&nbsp; The +4 Con is 2 hp/HD.&nbsp; This too makes a significant difference.&nbsp; As a Spirit of the Beast, you will likely do a bit less summoning than a Wild Mystic, and casting isn&#39;t a priority, however, this feat is still nice to have.&nbsp; I wouldn&#39;t work on getting it at low level, but at higher levels I would try to fit it in.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c15">Natural Spell:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;This is your level 5 feat.&nbsp; If you could take it at level 4 you would.&nbsp; This feat makes Wildshape a combat viable ability, well worth a feat slot.&nbsp; It is also the reason you are a better polymorpher than Wizards or Sorcerers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c2">Combat Casting:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;You are going to try to avoid casting on the defensive, as your primary casting stat isn&#39;t great, and therefore neither is your concentration, but sometimes you don&#39;t have the choice, and this can make a difference.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c2">Improved Initiative:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Tactically, initiative is a big deal in this game.&nbsp; Less important for you, who probably won&#39;t be using as many spells, but still good to have.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">Toughness:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;+1 HP per level is almost as good as 2 points of Con.&nbsp; Extra HP is always welcome to pretty much any class.&nbsp; For you, Toughness is the difference between your HP and the Fighters.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">Heavy Armor Proficiency:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Later on you will be wearing Ironwood armors.&nbsp; Honestly, getting a &quot;Wild&quot; enchantment on Hide just isn&#39;t worth it.&nbsp; Ironwood Full plate armor is going to be the best armor you can get, and assuming you aren&#39;t wildshaped all the time, you will find that being proficient is a good choice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">Craft Wondrous Item:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Specifically to ensure you have the correct Wisdom Bonuses you need to progress your spellcasting.&nbsp; If there is any doubt in regards to the availability of these items in your campaign, this is probably a good investment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c6">Feats from the Bestiary:&nbsp; Upon GM approval, consider these feats as well...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c15">Hover:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Pretty much a necessity if you wish to do full attacks while flying.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c2">Improved Natural Armor:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Self explanatory right?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3 c11">Skills</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although you have 4 skill points + Int/level and that might sound pretty good, expect to be feat-starved.&nbsp; The reason is you have a few &quot;must have&quot; skills, so once you have those...well, there just aren&#39;t many points left for the &quot;nice to have&quot; skills.&nbsp; I&#39;m only going to list the blue and green ranked skills, because there is more choices between those than you have skills slots to spend unfortunately.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c15">Knowledge (Nature):</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Firstly, you can only Wildshape into creatures you know, what creatures you know is defined by this skill, so it is a must-have and a must-max.&nbsp; Secondly, getting the most out of &quot;Nature Sense&quot; involves taking this as well.&nbsp; This is a &quot;max out&quot; skill.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c15">Perception:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The most used skill in the game.&nbsp; This too should be maxed out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c15">Handle Animal:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Also a must have.&nbsp; This allows you to &quot;push&quot; your summoned critters as well as teach your animal companion tricks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c20">Fly:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;You will be doing a lot of flying, and your maneuverability isn&#39;t always going to be all that hot, so this is really an important skill.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c20">Single Dips:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;You can&#39;t afford a lot of skills - especially after what I&#39;ve already listed.&nbsp; However, a few &quot;single level&quot; dips into skills can provide you with some basic ability.&nbsp; Climb, Swim, Survival and Heal are all decent choices for a quick &quot;dip&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c2 c16">Favored Class</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You are in melee, you sometimes need to tank to get advantage of full attacks, your AC isn&#39;t quite as good as the party fighter, you are working off d8 HP.&nbsp; Yeah, a skill point would be great, but there is only one choice here.&nbsp; With Favored Class going into HP and the Toughness feat, you can have your HP where they need to be as a front liner.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c2">Equipment:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Remember in Wildshape that you cannot speak (and therefore can&#39;t use spell trigger items), and you may or may not be able to hold something like a metamagic rod.&nbsp; Your equipment melds into your form, but equipment that has constant effects continue to function (except for armor), so when purchasing magic items, those with constant effects should be favored.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2">Wands:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;A great choice, especially at lower levels.&nbsp; First level wands are useful and cheap.&nbsp; You won&#39;t be using Wands in combat much, but some out of combat options like Cure light wounds wands are a good investment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Also worthy of a special note is a wand of Mage Armor.&nbsp; You can&#39;t use it, but odds are someone in your party can, whether through availability on a spell list or UMD.&nbsp; If you buy this wand, you can have them use it on you for a 1 hour +4 Armor bonus.&nbsp; Much cheaper than the &quot;wild&quot; enchantment on your armor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2">Scrolls:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Look at the spell list, if the spell is ranked orange, it&#39;s probably not a candidate for a wand, but as a scroll it&#39;s probably a decent investment.&nbsp; Again, just be aware these are out-of-wildshape use only.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2">Metamagic Rods:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Not really something I&#39;m going to worry too much about as a Spirit of the Beast.&nbsp; You can&#39;t use them wildshaped, and you aren&#39;t doing all that much casting in combat anyways.&nbsp; An extend rod for Magic Fang and/or Barkskin would certainly be a decent investment though.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2">Armor:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;At low levels Hide armor will do the trick until Wildshape is the form of choice.&nbsp; However, later on, you will want Darkwood Armor with the &quot;Wild&quot; enchantment for the best AC possible.&nbsp; The Wild enchantment ain&#39;t cheap, so be patient.&nbsp; In mid levels, you can live without it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2">*Shields:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;As of the current rules, Shield bonus to AC translates into Wildshape, however, Jason Bulmahn has confirmed that they are not meant to. &nbsp;As usual, your DM is the final authority. &nbsp;A large wooden shield is probably still a decent investment just for the protection it provides when you aren&#39;t wildshaped.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2">Weapons:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Not worth the investment.&nbsp; By the time the party is collecting magic weapons, you will be using tooth and claw.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2">Staves:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Not worth it for you, pretty much universally.&nbsp; Remember, casting isn&#39;t your primary function.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2">Wondrous Items and Rings</span><span class="c0">: The obvious items are on the list like Rings of Protection, Cloaks of resistance, Belts of Str (or better yet, all 3 physical stats), and Wisdom boost headbands.&nbsp; Amulets of natural armor won&#39;t stack with the natural armor from Barkskin, but do stack with the NA granted from Wildshape.&nbsp; Druids vestments will be an economical way to get an extra wildshape in the levels where you could really use an extra use (levels 5 through 7).&nbsp; Special note that a Monk&#39;s Robe is not so good anymore, as Wis bonus is no longer transferred to AC.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c2">Nature Bond</span></p><p class="c1 c10"><span class="c7 c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Good news, for the Spirit of the Beast, I recommend the animal companion as the obvious choice.&nbsp; The headache you received when reading my suggestion for the Wild Mystic can now go away at last.&nbsp; The Plant Domain has a couple abilities that would be interesting, but nothing that gives the tactical advantage as your friendly animal companion flank buddy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So now we need to discuss options.&nbsp; My suggestion is to be open to changing animal companions through your career.&nbsp; Certain animals &quot;advance&quot; at level 4, and others at level 7 - so usually you are better off with an animal that advances at level 7 between the levels of 1 and 3, then switch to an animal that advances at level 4 between the levels of 4 and 6, then switch back at level 7.&nbsp; Make sense?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The options for animal companion are nearly endless, and I have every reason to believe that the options will continue to expand as more rule supplements come out.&nbsp; I won&#39;t be going through a creature by creature evaluation, because really, there are so many options that aren&#39;t optimal.&nbsp; Instead I will give you the tools which to evaluate animal companions for yourself, then I will highlight some strong options from the Main Book and the Bestiary.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c2">Picking your companion: The mini-guide</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2">Offense:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Offense is the highest priority in your animal companion.&nbsp; It&#39;s not just your pal, it&#39;s part of your overall combat package.&nbsp; Your animal companions contribution to combat is really part of your contribution, so it&#39;s important that it can contribute effectively.&nbsp; This is not a minor class ability for you, so you must pick carefully.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c15">1) &quot;To hit&quot;:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; What is the animals &quot;To Hit&quot; chance?&nbsp; It will likely be lower than yours, and this is expected and acceptable, but how much lower?&nbsp; If the animal fails to hit, then it isn&#39;t contributing effectively.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since animal companions are fighting an uphill battle in this area, it&#39;s important you consider it carefully.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">2) # of attacks</span><span class="c0">: Your animal won&#39;t have a terrific &quot;To hit&quot; chance, so increasing the number of attacks is very important.&nbsp; Furthermore, if you have multiple attacks, then the &quot;Pounce&quot; ability becomes very important.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">3) Damage:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;This needs to be balanced carefully with number of attacks.&nbsp; A creature with 3 weak attacks may fail to penetrate even the mildest DR.&nbsp; That makes the creature ineffective.&nbsp; Therefore, Damage becomes a very real consideration.&nbsp; Damage of course is not just the die type of the attacks, but also the Strength modifier.&nbsp; A Rhino may only have one attack, but no DR is going to stop it.&nbsp; For creatures with lots of attacks, increasing the damage of those attacks will increase in importance as you gain levels.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c2">4) Combat Maneuvers:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Trip is the best combat maneuver ability you are going to get because it is not invalidated by size like grab can be.&nbsp; Your animal companions &quot;trip&quot; CMB isn&#39;t going to be great, but it&#39;s an add-on.&nbsp; You are attacking for damage, but even if you only have a 10% chance to land this ability, it will still be helpful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2">Maneuverability:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;All the offense in the world means little if your Animal Companion can&#39;t get into the fight.&nbsp; Therefore, maneuverability becomes a high priority, especially since starting at mid levels, your own maneuverability becomes pretty good.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">1) Flight:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;A huge bonus if your animal companion has this, but it&#39;s always a costly ability to get.&nbsp; The animal companion choices with the best offensive abilities will not be natural flyers, but it needs to be balanced with the animals who can fly naturally, as flight is a huge bonus.&nbsp; You may get stuck &quot;Air walking&quot; your companion, but at least consider the flyers first.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">2) Land speed:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;If your companion doesn&#39;t fly, then land speed is quite important.&nbsp; I would consider any land speed under 40&#39; a significant disadvantage, and I would avoid land speeds below 30&#39; like the plague.&nbsp; Speeds of 60&#39; + will often mean the Animal Companion can out move you, which isn&#39;t always the best tactically either, so that&#39;s a mixed bag.&nbsp; A land speed of 40&#39; to 50&#39; is right where you want it.&nbsp; A 30&#39; move isn&#39;t a deal breaker though, remember, with Share Spells you can cast longstrider on your animal companion for a long duration 10&#39; move boost.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c2">3) Other movement types:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;If your companion can burrow, swim or climb, these are all advantages.&nbsp; None of them are must haves, or even close to must haves (except in weird campaigns - like aquatic campaigns), however, they are all nice to have.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2">Defense:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Less important than you may think.&nbsp; Generally, you should expect if your animal companion is targeted, it will be hit.&nbsp; The reason is because the AC is going to be significantly lower than combat based PC&#39;s in your party, so if it&#39;s 5 less or 8 less, the animal companion is likely going to be hit in either case.&nbsp; HP however, are your companions ability to take that hit, and therefore are important.&nbsp; Remember that Animal Companions are replaceable.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c15">1) HP:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Your most important consideration defensively.&nbsp; Your animal needs to be able to take a hit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c2">2) AC:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Less important than you may think.&nbsp; It&#39;s just not something you are going to have at the level where your animal companion is defensively sound.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c2">Advancing your companion: The hints.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Here&#39;s some advice for advancing your companion:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">1) Ability increase:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Every 4 levels your companion gets to increase an ability score.&nbsp; I recommend an increase in Int to 3.&nbsp; This will give your animal companion the ability to understand your verbal commands.&nbsp; No more need to &quot;push&quot; or use &quot;tricks&quot;, instead simply tell your companion to &quot;flank on that guy&quot;, or &quot;Try to grapple that guy&quot;.&nbsp; Handy eh?&nbsp; The ability to purchase any skill is just a bonus.&nbsp; Once the Int is 3, it&#39;s going to all be about Strength.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">2) Feat selection:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Remember combat is your primary focus.&nbsp; Power attack is going to be especially important as levels increase, as it will occasionally be required as a way to punch through DR.&nbsp; Toughness will give a nice HP boost, this is a good low level choice too.&nbsp; Improved Natural attack and Weapon Focus are nice to haves, but don&#39;t rush to grab them, they can be a mid or late level purchase.&nbsp; Remember for creatures with claw/bite, that&#39;s only going to affect one choice.&nbsp; Once your animal companion gets an Int of 3, then they can select any feat they can qualify for - so Cleave, Vital Strike (if they are one attack creatures), hover (for flyers) are all good choices.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">3) Skill Selection:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Acrobatics is key, as the animal will be a flanker.&nbsp; Fly of course is important for any flying animal companion.&nbsp; Perception is always handy.&nbsp; Stealth is also a very useful skill to have.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2">Tricks:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Animal companions rely on &quot;tricks&quot; to determine what you can have them do.&nbsp; Once you raise the Int to 3, then the animal companion should be able to understand your language, and you should simply be able to tell it what you want it to do (though you may want to rely on party members to direct your animal companion since you can&#39;t speak when wildshaped), but until then, tricks are very important.&nbsp; As an animal companion it will know additional tricks, but use Animal Handling to train more tricks.&nbsp; Animals have a limit how many tricks they can learn based on their Int score.&nbsp; Here are some tricks you definitely want your companion to know:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Attack:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The first trick any animal companion should know.&nbsp; The animal companion is for combat, so understanding an attack command is vital.&nbsp; Use the &quot;Two&quot; trick option where you can have your animal companion attack undead and aberrations.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Defend:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Having your animal companion seek to defend you without being commanded to do so is going to be very handy indeed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Guard:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;It won&#39;t be unusual for you to want to use your animal companion for guard duty, especially if the animal companion has the benefits of &quot;scent&quot; which it very likely will.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Track:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Again, a great way to take advantage of the track ability.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c2">Special abilities:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Link</span><span class="c0">: Handle animal as a free action or push as a move action, +4 to handle animal checks with your animal.&nbsp; This is gained at level 1 and that&#39;s when you want it.&nbsp; Later on, the animal can understand language and you can have another party member shout out suggestions in combat.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Share Spells:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a huge amount of self only Druid spells that you are going to want to cast for your animal companion.&nbsp; Longstrider kind of sticks out as a possibility, and someday, Shapechange - but in between, not much.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Evasion:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Always a nice ability to have, and helps with the reduced HP of your animal companion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ability score increase:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;A big deal, mainly because an increase in Int to 3 means that your animal now understands language, which means that your party Wizard can request your animal companion please assume a flanking position with the fighter, etc, without requiring an animal handling skill.&nbsp; Adding to Str later on is always nice, but not as dramatic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Devotion:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;+4 to Will saves vs enchantment.&nbsp; Always a nice type of spells to gain a bonus against, and Will is likely going to be a weak save.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Multiattack:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Only useful if it has secondary attacks, but if it does, a nice offensive boost.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Improved Evasion:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The next level of evasion.&nbsp; Not a huge benefit, but still nice to have.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2">Choices:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; I&#39;ll be evaluating the choices assuming you are not playing an aquatic campaign.&nbsp; I&#39;ll specifically look at choices for level 1, level 4 and level 7.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c2">Level 1:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">Bear:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;A solid choice, we assume this is a baby bear (small size), with a +2 strength bonus and 3 attacks per round, offensively this is solid.&nbsp; 40&#39; move does the job.&nbsp; A pretty straight ahead choice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">Cheetah:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;A slight decrease in offense, but you still get 3 attacks, a 50&#39; speed, and a trip attack.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">Horse:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Large sized creature, the hooves are secondary, but the bite is primary.&nbsp; Good Str score and Con score as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c2">Dire Bat:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Worth mentioning as it begins with Blindsense and has a good flying maneuverability.&nbsp; I&#39;m not recommending it though.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">Elephant (Bestiary):</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Offensively fairly solid with a +2 str bonus and good die types on two attacks.&nbsp; Actually has a good AC (16) too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c2">Roc (Bestiary):</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Medium sized at level 1 and the advantage of a flyer.&nbsp; By far your best offensive bet with a flying creature.&nbsp; A bit squishy though.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c2">Level 4:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">Ape:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Receives a big bonus to Str (total 21) and an increase in die type for its 3 natural attacks.&nbsp; Quite the beast at this level.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">Snake, Constrictor:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Also receives a nice Str bonus (total 23), and although it only has one attack, being Large, it will occasionally gain the benefit of grab/constrict.&nbsp; Speed is a problem - longstrider can help, but it&#39;s still going to hurt.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c2">Level 7:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c15">Tiger/Lion:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;A good choice for the level, granting the ever-important Pounce, large size plus grab is a nice combo too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">Ankylosaurus:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;mix a good defense (AC is good) with a pretty good Strength and the very nice stun ability.&nbsp;

Secondly, you get the Size of the creature, thirdly, you get the natural attacks of the creature, and fourth, you gain the base movement of the creature.&nbsp; Your items &quot;meld&quot; into the new form, and armor bonuses are lost.&nbsp; Other items that grant permanent effects function as normal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wildshaping works similarly to Polymorph spells, but there are a few notable differences, pretty much exclusively in the Druid&#39;s favor.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">1)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;First and foremost, Wildshape allows the &quot;Natural Spell&quot; feat which allows spellcasting to take place when Wildshaped.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">2)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Secondly, Armor with the &quot;Wild&quot; enchantment can still provide an armor bonus in Wildshape.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">3)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Wildshape has a duration of 1 hour/level.&nbsp; This is significantly longer than the Polymorph spells</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">4)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Using Wildshape does not provoke an attack of opportunity when used, no defensive casting required</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">5)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Being a Supernatural ability, Wildshape cannot be dispelled (though it can be suppressed by an antimagic field)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">6)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;When you wildshape into a creature that Swims or Burrows, you are able to breath in these environments</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">7)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;This is obvious, but worthy of mention anyways: Wildshape doesn&#39;t use up valuable casting slots.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The abilities of a Druid&#39;s Wildshape improve with level.&nbsp; The Natural attacks are always gained, but more abilities are gained depending on the level of the Druid:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">4th level:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Wildshape as Beast Shape 1, 1/day.&nbsp; Small or Medium animal</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">6th level:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Tiny or Large animal as Beast Shape 2, or small Elemental as Elemental body 1, 2/day</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">8th level:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Huge or diminutive animal as Beast Shape 3, &nbsp;medium Elemental as Elemental body 2, Small or Medium Plant creature as Plant shape 1, 3/day</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">10th level:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Large Elemental as Elemental body III, Large plant as Plant Shape II, 4/day</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">12th level:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Huge Elemental as Elemental body IV, Huge plant as Plant shape III, 5/day</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c2">1/day extra uses every 2 levels afterwards.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lets go over the various abilities gained with Each form of Wildshape, and I&#39;ll go over some form options for each.&nbsp; You will find a lot of animals bring very much the same things to the table, so I&#39;ll cover the best choices.&nbsp; For example, Goblin Dog, Hyena and Wolf all bring identical abilities to the table for Beast Shape I, and the Riding dog is just worse (as it&#39;s slower), so listing all these creatures really makes no sense.&nbsp; Instead, I&#39;ll list your &quot;go to&quot; forms for each, covering the various abilities you may want to access.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2">Beast Shape I:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;You aren&#39;t getting much here, but do get Climb, Fly (up to average), or Swim at a maximum of 30 feet if the creature has this movement.&nbsp; Also, you get Darkvision 60, Low-light vision, and scent if the creature had the ability.&nbsp; If you take the form of a small animal, you get a +2 size bonus to Dex and +1 Natural Armor bonus.&nbsp; If you take the form of a medium animal, you get a +2 size bonus to Str and +2 natural armor bonus.&nbsp; This is where you say, &quot;Do I ever want to take the form of a small animal?&quot;, to which I reply, &quot;No...never.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c2">Form options to consider:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c15">Dinosaur, Deinonychus</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;This is your primary combat form for Beast Shape I.&nbsp; 4 attacks, count them 1, 2, 3, oh - sorry he&#39;s dead now...put that last one away.&nbsp; There isn&#39;t even any running away for him, because you can chase him at a speed of 60&#39;.&nbsp; Is this worth considering at higher level?&nbsp; The Bestiary gives options for a large version of this creature.&nbsp; If allowed, I would certainly recommend it with Beast Shape II.&nbsp; Otherwise, just enjoy it right now.&nbsp; Welcome to Wildshape.&nbsp; Low light vision and scent as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">Leopard:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The Deinonychus laughs at you for your silly little 3 attacks, but if you need to do some climbing, this is your form.&nbsp; Get 3 primary attacks with a 20&#39; climb, and 30&#39; on the ground.&nbsp; Low light and scent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">Squid</span><span class="c0">: Your aquatic form.&nbsp; Swim speed is going to be 30&#39; at this level.&nbsp; You get 2 natural attacks and low light vision.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c2">Riding Dog:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The main reason to take this form is that you can pretty much go anywhere as a big friendly dog.&nbsp; You get a single attack and a 40&#39; move, so nothing really fantastic here otherwise.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2">Beast Shape II:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Significantly better than Beast Shape I.&nbsp; Now the movements can reach 60 feet (and Fly maneuverability up to good).&nbsp; Grab, pounce, and Trip are received if the animal has the ability.&nbsp; If you take the form of a tiny animal, you get a +4 Dex, -2 Str, and +1 NA...LOL - just kidding!&nbsp; Tiny animal - that&#39;s a good one.&nbsp; If you take the form of a large creature, and if you don&#39;t, what&#39;s wrong with you?&nbsp; You get +4 Str, -2 Dex and +4 NA.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c2">Form options to consider:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c15">Dire Tiger:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Here&#39;s your standard combat form for this level.&nbsp; 3 primary attacks with pounce, grab on all 3 attacks.&nbsp; The damage is pretty good on all 3.&nbsp; Speed 40&#39; Low light and scent.&nbsp; The regular tiger is only minutely worse (the bite does a tiny bit less damage).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">Dire Ape:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;No rend for you, but a large sized creature with 3 primary attacks, 10 foot reach, a climb speed (30&#39;), low light vision and scent.&nbsp; The reach is really the selling point here.</span></p><p class="c1 c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c2">Bat, Dire:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;You can actually become a flying mount, which is certainly handy.&nbsp; Also, you can get a (good) maneuverability on fly (40&#39;).&nbsp;&nbsp; A large creature.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">Giant Octopus:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;9 attacks.&nbsp; definitely a decent swim form.&nbsp; Add in grab on 8 of those 9 attacks.&nbsp; Damage ain&#39;t great - but so many attacks has me dazzled.&nbsp; If you need to swim, a good choice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c2">Dire Wolf:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;For trip.&nbsp; That&#39;s really the main reason to take this form.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">Heavy Horse:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Specifically you may want this form for 3 reasons.&nbsp; First, you can get barding for this form very easily.&nbsp; Second, you can carry a rider, which may be very valuable if you plan ahead with another character, and third, you are going to be allowed in pretty much any town or city.&nbsp; The form otherwise isn&#39;t too bad.&nbsp; You get 3 attacks (2 of which are secondary) a decent move of 50&#39;, low light and scent.&nbsp; Definitely a step down otherwise from Dire Tiger.</span></p><p class="c1 c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2">Beast Shape III:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;You can now gain burrow up to 30 feet, 90 feet on other movement types, Blindsense up to 30 feet, Constrict, Ferocity, Jet, Poison, Rake, Trample and Web.&nbsp; (You won&#39;t find Web).&nbsp; For Diminutive animals, it&#39;s a +6 Dex, -4 Str and +1 NA, for Huge Animals it&#39;s a +6 Str, -4 Dex, and +6 NA.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c2">Forms to consider:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c2">Elasmosaurus:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;A swim form with a swim speed of 50&#39;.&nbsp; Can move on land as well at 20&#39;.&nbsp; One attack only for 2d8 damage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">Stegosaurus:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;A bit slow at 30&#39; but the tail does 4d6 + 1.5 Str for a solid hit (and vital strike or cleave contender).&nbsp; Also includes a trip attack, so not bad at all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">Giant Squid:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Swim at 60&#39;, Jet at 260&#39;.&nbsp; 4 Decent attacks (one of which does 4d6), and a grab/constrict attack.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c8">Elemental Body I:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Take a form of any of the 4 elementals (small size).&nbsp; This includes Darkvision with every form as well as special movement types (like Fly(perfect) and Earth glide).&nbsp; A size bonus of +2 to a variable ability score and a variable Natural armor bonus.&nbsp; A few special abilities (like Whirlwind and Push) are also gained.&nbsp; The way I read it, Natural spell should still work even if you are in the near-invulnerable whirlwind form.&nbsp; However, this is a loophole, and I can&#39;t recommend it for gameplay.&nbsp; Generally, these will be utility forms only.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c2">Forms to consider:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c4">Earth:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;A nice little form.&nbsp; Earth glide is handy, and you are getting a nice +4 NA bonus.&nbsp; Not a form I would regularly take, but in a cave like environment, could be decent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c2">Fire:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;A Dex bonus is always welcome, and fire resistance is often handy.&nbsp; The burn ability is situational, but occasionally nice to have.&nbsp; Nothing super here, but OK.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c2">Air</span><span class="c2 c3">:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;If you need a fly (perfect) form, this will do the job.&nbsp; Not a powerhouse though.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c2">Water:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The Drench ability will be a very circumstantial power, but when you need it, quite effective.&nbsp; Otherwise, this form isn&#39;t offering you too much.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2">Elemental Body II:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;As Elemental body I except the Elemental form is now Medium.&nbsp; The Ability score bonuses move up to +4, and the Natural Armor granted increases as well (by a straight +1 across the board).&nbsp; Defensively, a Dex bonus form like Air Elemental should come out a bit ahead of the Elemental body I (by one AC).&nbsp; The other forms will trade size bonus to AC to NA bonus to AC and come out even.&nbsp; In any case, I&#39;m using Beast Shape III as my primary combat form, but if you need to be medium size...well then be a Leopard.&nbsp; Really, I wouldn&#39;t bother.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2">Elemental Body III: </span><span class="c0">As Elemental Body II except now you are large size, you NET +6 to ability scores (no longer a single stat - and some forms include a penalty), and NA goes up by one again.&nbsp; Not a big improvement over EBII IMO.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c2">Forms to consider:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c2">Large Air:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Really the main reason to take this form is the Whirlwind ability or for the fly (perfect).&nbsp; However, the two decent slam attacks makes this not a terrible combat form when the need arises.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">Large Earth:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Just as much bonus to Str as Beast Shape III, the same NA bonus too, except the penalty to Dex is not as bad and you get a Con boost, so this is actually a viable option for combat.&nbsp; 2 Slam attacks don&#39;t impress too much though, but mixed with push, earth glide and earth mastery this is a situational combat form - a good choice when Huge is just too darned big.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2">Elemental Body IV:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Now you are huge, and you get some nice goodies.&nbsp; DR 5/-, and immunity to critical hits and sneak attack.&nbsp; Natural Armor does not increase this time (which will likely result in a net loss of AC for most forms), but ability score net bonus is up to +10.&nbsp; Also, Air and Water elementals double their movement.&nbsp; That&#39;s a really nice enhancement.&nbsp; Since Elder elementals are Huge, you might as well take the Elder form.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c2">Forms to Consider:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c15">Air, Elder:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;You get fly at 100&#39; (perfect) which is awesome.&nbsp; The Whirlwind ability works on creatures of large size, and the two slam attacks aren&#39;t looking too bad.&nbsp; +4 Strength isn&#39;t bad, +6 Dex and the NA bonus means AC shouldn&#39;t be too bad either.&nbsp; Overall, a Solid form that will Carry you into the &quot;fly&quot; levels.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c2">Water, Elder:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Situational, and I&#39;m not sure this is better than some of your Beast Shape forms, but the swim speed is fantastic, and Vortex gets pretty nasty around this size.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">Earth, Elder:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The Best Strength bonus you will get with Wildshape (+8) and the (+4) con bonus is welcome as well.&nbsp; The two slam attacks are 2d10 each, which is OK.&nbsp; Overall, you may find some of the Beast Shape forms still outdamaging this form, but defensively, this form is a winner over them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2">Plant Shape I:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Not a very good ability, as you can turn into a Small or Medium plant, which, after scouring the entire Bestiary, totals 4 forms.&nbsp; Every single one is a bad option.&nbsp; Therefore, until more plant creatures are available, this is a wasted ability.&nbsp; I&#39;ll go over why they are all poor options here:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c2">Forms you shouldn&#39;t waste your time with:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">Vegepygmy:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Darkvision, Low light vision, 2x1d4 natural attacks.&nbsp; Nothing especially wonderful here, and it&#39;s a very silly creature.&nbsp; (You decide if that&#39;s a bonus or not)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">Basidirond:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Low light vision and a 1d8 slam attack.&nbsp; The best feature of the form you don&#39;t get with plant shape (the hallucination cloud).&nbsp; Not much here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">Violet Fungus:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Here&#39;s a ripoff.&nbsp; Violet Fungus can be harvested to create a venom, but they don&#39;t have a &quot;poison&quot; attack, so what you get are 4x1d4 attacks and a crappy movement speed.&nbsp; The &quot;Rot&quot; ability will not transfer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">Yellow Musk Creeper:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;This may be the worst polymorph option in the game.&nbsp; Reduce your speed to 5&#39; and get a 1x1d4 attack.&nbsp; We&#39;re done.&nbsp; Nothing else translates.&nbsp; I wish I had a ranking worse than red.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2">Plant Shape II:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Still pretty bad choices, not as absolutely terrible as Plant Shape I, but worse than your Beast Shape choices pretty much universally.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c2">Forms not to consider:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">Assassin Vine:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;You are going to be all but immobile (5&#39; move) but you do get a singe 1d8 attack with 10&#39; reach.&nbsp; The reason you may want this form is for grab and constrict, however, you should note that Entangle does not translate.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">Shambling Mound:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;It gets Darkvision, Low light vision, and 2 decent slam attacks (2d6 each) and both attacks have grab and constrict.&nbsp; Also, both attacks have 10&#39; reach.&nbsp; However, this isn&#39;t even as good as Dire Tiger, which you got levels ago.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2">Plant Shape III:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Ohhhh you can get Regeneration...just kidding.&nbsp; In fact, there is only one Huge plant form, and it&#39;s the Treant which is a crappy form, and since no Plant creature in the Bestiary has regeneration, until more creatures are available, this is horrible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c2">The good news: There&#39;s only one bad option with PSIII.&nbsp; The bad news: It&#39;s the only option:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">Treant:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Sigh.&nbsp; No longer a good polymorph.&nbsp; You get 2 slam attacks for 2d6 each and that pretty much covers it.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c2">Playing a Spirit of the Beast:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The niche you are going to fill is one of front-liner.&nbsp; Like a Cleric you are a divine caster who engages in melee, unlike a Cleric, you can expect to be the primary damage dealer in your party.&nbsp; Your party fighter may out-defense you, but what you lack in defense you make up for in offense.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Why not play a fighter instead?&nbsp; Straight up comparison of Fighter vs. Druid in melee, unsurprisingly, expect the fighter to edge out ahead, but not hugely so.&nbsp; The Druid choice is for other factors.&nbsp; The Druid can run circles around the party Monk, fly, swim, climb, burrow, bring as many as 7 attacks per round to bear by level 4, and gets 9 spell levels of casting.&nbsp; So when comparing to a fighter, expect less damage on a single hit.&nbsp; Expect less AC, and possibly less HP too.&nbsp; Expect less ability on Combat Maneuvers, but expect more attacks, more maneuverability, better sensory ability and more flexibility.&nbsp; If those are your priorities, then that is why you would choose the Druid.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">How does it stack up?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Let&#39;s consider a 5th level fighter.&nbsp; He&#39;s probably sporting the 18 Strength, he&#39;s got BAB of 4, Full Plate +1, and a Greatsword +1.&nbsp; He&#39;s probably wearing a Ring of Protection +1 and has approximately 46 HP.&nbsp; His attack is +12 (+5 BAB, +4 Str, WF, +1 enhance, +1 Weap Tr) for 2d6+10 (+6 Str, +2 WS, +1 Enh, +1 Weap tr) Damage - that&#39;s 17 on an average hit.&nbsp; His AC is 23 (10+ 9 armor, +1 enh, +2 Dex, +1 deflection).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So that&#39;s:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">HP: 46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">AC: 23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Attack: +12 2d6+10 (average 17)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Let&#39;s compare a 5 level Spirit of the Beast.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He&#39;s got the attribute spread listed above for the 15 point attribute buy.&nbsp;

He has a Ring of Protection +1, Wears a Large Shield +1, His feats are Toughness, Power attack, and Dodge.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So when in combat, Wildshaped into a Deinonychus and flanking with his Ape companion we&#39;re looking at:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">HP: 45 (Druid) 36 (Ape)&nbsp; (Druid HP assumes average HP rolls, toughness, Con 14, favored class bonus)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">AC: 21 (Druid) 19 (Ape) (Druid AC 10+ 2 Nat, +2 Nat enh, +2 shield, +1 enh, +1 Def, +1 Dodge, +2 Dex)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Attack: +10/+10/+10+5 (Druid) +10/+10/+10 (ape) (Druid +3 BAB, +5 Str, +1 enh, +2 flank, -1 power attack)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Damage: 1d8+8/1d6+8/1d6+8/1d4+3 (Druid) average 41&nbsp; 1d6+9/1d6+9/1d6+9 (Ape) average 37.&nbsp; Total average 78</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, I&#39;ve taken a number of liberties here.&nbsp; Certainly the fighter could get flank too.&nbsp; Sometimes Barkskin may not be active, maybe Greater Magic Fang got dispelled, maybe the Fighter is better optimized.&nbsp; We are also assuming full attacks, which at this level, favors the Druid heavily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, look at the numbers, even considering the liberties, the Druid is faring well is it not?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now in one more level that Fighter is getting another attack (at -5).&nbsp; However, in one more level that Druid is now taking a Dire Tiger form, and the Ape just got significantly tougher.&nbsp; One level after that, the Ape turns into a tougher Tiger form, and now full attacks aren&#39;t an issue, since both Druid and animal companion are pouncing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So I guess my point is that there are a huge number of variables in play, but overall, expect poorer chance to hit than the fighter, but only slightly so.&nbsp; Expect poorer AC bonus, but only slightly so, expect lower HP, but only slightly so, and expect significantly higher damage potential, and not just slightly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I forgot about saves.&nbsp; Yeah, saves are better too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When playing a Spirit of the Beast, start out with Hide armor, a Shield and a Scimitar.&nbsp; With good physical stats and an animal companion, you should be capable in melee, offensively you should be aces.&nbsp; Then start Wildshaping occasionally at level 4, and as often as possible at level 5.&nbsp; Use spells for inter-combat healing or buffing, and in combat for the occasional Summon spell to strengthen the odds.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Limitations:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;This build functions better than the Wild Mystic at low levels, it can really hold it&#39;s own.&nbsp; Expect to feel like a king between levels 5 and 10.&nbsp; However, unlike the Wild Mystic, expect a more serious decline in the higher levels.&nbsp; Wildshape just stops getting better, and your animal companion advances in power more slowly than a PC.&nbsp; Your spells are not providing many upper level buff options, and you just aren&#39;t getting as many attacks per round in comparison to the other players that you used to get.&nbsp; This build should remain viable right into high levels, but the real shine occurs in the single digit levels.&nbsp; At the higher levels, expect to rely more and more on spellcasting, to which you really aren&#39;t built towards.</span></p></body></html>
