You can get Intimidate or Bluff from traits, though the latter is a harder fit.&nbsp; More to the point, you have a reputation to uphold (given that you lose class features if you violate your code of conduct) and Detect Evil.&nbsp; You lose out on the ability to wheel and deal with evil creatures, but you are trustworthy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c21 c4">The Tank:&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c21 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You have a d10 hit dice, you have Heavy armor, you have great saves, smiting boosts AC, and you are penalized less than other classes for carrying a shield (as less of your damage comes from strength and more of it comes from smiting).&nbsp; Add to this your ability to heal yourself as a swift action, finally a decent in combat heal before level 11, and you have all the makings of the hard target.&nbsp; That said, PCs should never be the party&#39;s punching bag of choice which is why druids (and some clerics) have animal companions, more than a third of the classes in the game can summon, and full casters can bind up foes from afar or debuff them to the point where their paltry attacks don&#39;t matter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c21 c7 c11">The Smiter</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Paladins really toss out the damage against specific foes.&nbsp; Double smite damage against undead, evil outsiders, and evil dragons really stacks up.&nbsp; Also consider that the tough varieties of these foes typically have a couple decent lines of defense - AC, SR, DR, and spell like abilities.&nbsp; Smite helps against AC and bypasses DR...paladin is THE mellee class that doesn&#39;t have to worry about DR or get hosed by it at high levels.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c7">Race</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The Paladin can choose a couple different combat styles and the benefits of race depend on which you choose:</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c7 c20">Dwarf:</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">The penalty to Cha is tough to overlook.&nbsp; The speed penalty is meaningless because you probably want heavy armor.&nbsp; Darkvision is good, the random bonuses against low level monsters are ok.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c7 c20">Elf</span><span class="c14 c20">:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Dex is ok if you want to be shooting a bow and for TWF users who need to hit 15 Dex, but a penalty to Con and no bonus to the big two stats...Str and Cha isn&#39;t so hot.&nbsp; The other bonuses don&#39;t really help, unlike the other mellee classes enchantments aren&#39;t quite as nasty, perception isn&#39;t your boathouse, and you needn&#39;t beat SR.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c11 c20">Human:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You need 2 feats at 1st level for both the Shield TWF&#39;er and for a bow user.&nbsp; Paladins are pretty feat poor so this is a great choice.&nbsp; You skill list isn&#39;t shabby and the extra skill point helps.&nbsp; The flexible +2 is equally good.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c20">Half-Elf:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Just like a human, but your feat has to be skill focus...that wouldn&#39;t be my first choice of feats.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c7 c20">Half Orc:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Darkvision and ferocity are pretty darn good.&nbsp; Those I might trade for a feat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c7 c20">Halflings:</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span>You get good archer paladin stats.&nbsp; Being small with the strength penalty trades +1 to hit and to AC for a -1 damage...which is a pretty decent trade.&nbsp; For the archer paladin, Halfling is a pretty good choice, for mellee the trade is not so good.&nbsp; Also depends very strongly on access to equipment.&nbsp; RAW you get hosed on equipment because so little small equipment is laying around.&nbsp; If your DM is mindful of this or bends the rules to let armor and especially weapons work for small PCs, go for it. Also small characters can ride medium mounts inside dungeons.&nbsp; If you want to go mounted, halfling and gnome make good choices</span><span class="c18 c23 c7 c24">.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c18 c23 c7 c24"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c15 c7 c20">Gnomes:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Same as above.&nbsp; Though Con is better than Dex for mellee characters.&nbsp; Here a mellee character with a str penalty and small size gets +1 AC no change in to hit and -1 damage. Really depends on equipment and if you plan on being mounted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c12">Divine Bond:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c19">Weapon Bond</span><span class="c20">:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The upside is that your weapon bond is very strong either ensuring that your weapon is maxed out on enhancement bonuses, increasing your crit range (those are your first two priorities) or adding extra attacks or extra damage at high level.&nbsp; The downside is the standard action cast time and that you cannot use it on your second weapon if you TWF.&nbsp; The ability is extremely flexible and when combined with smiting really pumps up your to hit modifier at mid level.&nbsp; Note: the ability seems to stack with Greater Magic Weapon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c7 c20">Mount :</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The rating of this ability is determined by two factors: 1) Do you need a mount for Mounted Combat? 2) Does your DM allow you to choose creatures that are on the Druid Animal Companion list but not explicitly included on the paladin list?&nbsp; If your answer to either of the above is yes, the Mount is a better choice.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If you are considering the Mount as an option, also consider playing a small race.&nbsp; Small creatures can ride medium mounts which have the benefits of better fitting within the dungeon environment.&nbsp; The squeeze rules are quite harsh and because a lance is a reach weapon you will need at least 20&#39; of width to Ride By Attack if you are Medium and riding a Large creature.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Also be aware that unlike in 3.5, your mount is no longer summoned at will and sent back into the ether (the so called poke-mount) it can be summoned to you but not sent into the ether.&nbsp; That means any space a horse (or dog or camel) cannot fit through or cannot logically pass (like climbing up a rope) leaves it stuck there until you summon it to the next place.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Finally, before you choose, be aware of several potential concerns with the mount option.&nbsp; Your mount has an Int of 6, it shouldn&#39;t need war training because it is intelligent (confirmed by James Jacob in Paizo Chat).&nbsp; A character with a Mount unlike an Animal Companion really gets screwed if the animal dies.&nbsp; It takes 30 days for the paladin to get a new Mount.&nbsp; That is a long time to be without a mount.&nbsp; In that time, you would be forced to rely upon an actual, backup horse, the </span><span class="c8">Mount</span><span>&nbsp;spell, or the </span><span class="c8">Phantom Steed</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;spell.&nbsp; At mid to high level, those are one shot kills - leaving you, yet again without a mount.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c22 c7">Large Listed Mounts:</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Horse has a better AC than camel and more attacks.&nbsp; The spit feature on the camel is decent, but I would prefer the attacks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c22 c7">Medium Listed Mounts:</span><span class="c9 c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Boar has the best AC and will probably do more damage on its one attack than a pony (next best choice) does on two because of better die and Strength.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c7">Other Special Abilities:</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c12 c7"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c22 c7 c20">Smite Evil:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Yes, you will be smiting evil....Evil, consider yourself smited.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c22 c7 c20">Detect Evil:</span><span class="c15 c7 c20">&nbsp;</span><span>For when you need to know if you can smite, now conveniently in a new move action formulation</span><span class="c18 c23 c7 c24">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c22 c7 c20">Lay On Hands:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This ability is excellent mostly because it is one of the best in combat heals in the game.&nbsp; Swift action self healing is part of what makes the paladin shine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c22 c7 c20">Mercy:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;I recommend Sickened, Dazed, Nauseated, Stunned, Blinded, then Diseased (in that order) but this really depends on what you are likely to be facing.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c22 c7 c20">Channel:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The Cleric is better than you at this.&nbsp; Only use before you lack access to a wand of Cure Light or other similar magic.&nbsp; Not to be greedy, but if you tank you can freely reserve the healing for its in-combat use.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c22 c7 c20">Aura of Courage:</span><span class="c7 c20">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Situational to be sure, but allies will love the bonus and you will love one less way to get screwed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c22 c7 c20">Aura of Resolve:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Nobody likes being told what to do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c22 c7 c20">Aura of Justice:</span><span class="c22 c20">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">If you have multiple allies in mellee combat or decent (smaller) summons in the party this ability is pretty awesome.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c22 c7 c20">Aura of Faith:</span><span class="c22 c20">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Saves some align weapon castings.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c22 c7 c20">Aura of Righteousness:</span><span class="c15 c7 c20">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Nobody likes being told what to do, part 2.&nbsp; Now with DR.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c20 c22">Holy Champion:</span><span class="c15 c7 c20">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">More DR. Plus you can banish evil outsiders. Most importantly...maxed out Lay on hands</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c7">Specialization, How do you Take your Smite:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c20">Lancer:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;Knight in shining armor astride his mighty stallion may be the most traditional hero in fantasy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>This option is </span><span class="c4">OK</span><span>&nbsp;for Medium races and </span><span class="c15 c7">Recommended</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;for Small Races.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The Lancer focuses on using his mobility to ensure that he gets Spirited Charge attacks while enemies must charge for lesser damage.&nbsp; The best way of building this character is to have a small character atop a medium mount.&nbsp; You will be more mobile and considerably less likely to get bottlenecked.&nbsp; Most importantly you can get your mount through the door.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Tactically you must remember that you must always charge in a straight line and that you have reach with a lance.&nbsp; Your best option is to charge just inside your range and just outside of the 5&#39; reach of medium creatures in a line along side the creature.&nbsp; Even against creatures with reach you do not provoke, however they are better at cutting off your attack angles.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Remember that just because you can cover a lot of ground, (double your mount&#39;s speed) doesn&#39;t mean that your should.&nbsp; You will often miss key buffs by staying outside of the usual 30&#39; buff range.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Also, your mount can be tough, but he isn&#39;t invincible and losing him will be a significant disadvantage.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Pros:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You get a bunch of damage based one high to hit modifier attack.&nbsp; Also, you benefit from reach and being quite difficult to get to.&nbsp; Also, least ability score dependent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c9">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cons:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="c2">Terrain can really hose you, especially if you are not small.&nbsp; If your mount dies, you must wait 30 days.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c11 c20">Archer:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A damage machine, you probably get off more full attacks than comparable characters and really max out smite damage.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This option is new to Pathfinder and is extremely effective.&nbsp; Ranged weapons have several advantages: you get many attacks with one weapon which reduces equipment costs and drastically increases damage, you can get more full attacks off than mellee characters because you don&#39;t need to close in to mellee range, and you can better manage terrain (like flying creatures and broken ground).&nbsp; The downside is that against foes with reach you may be forced to decided between giving up full attacks and eating AoOs this is especially true because of the Acrobatics nerf which punishes characters in medium or heavy armor.&nbsp; One way to mitigate this loss is to give a serious look at Mounted Archery.&nbsp; The mount gives considerable mobility because it is fast and can move you without you spending an action.&nbsp; With mounted archery your penalty to hit is minimal even on a double move.&nbsp; If your DM allows for flying mounts you are even more capable of staying out of AoO range.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Tactically archers are simple.&nbsp; 1) Whenever possible, full attack. 2) Using Rapid Shot is better than not using Rapid Shot in nearly ever case (on some AC values it breaks even).&nbsp; See Deadly Aim in the feat section for further advice.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

That said, I recommended low Int for every build because these builds are optimized for combat.&nbsp; Some of those builds are more or less forced to spend the 1 skill point per level a non-human with an 8 or lower Int gets on Ride and might want something to do out of combat.&nbsp; If that is the case, you might need to spend your favored class bonus on the skill point.&nbsp; Just be glad you don&#39;t need Wisdom for spells in Pathfinder.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Equipment Choices:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c20 c29">Weapons:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Smite gets multiplied on a crit.&nbsp; Smite is a significant factor in determining damage output.&nbsp; Die size (e.g. 1d6 v 1d8) really isn&#39;t very significant.&nbsp; Given a choice of weapons, the best option is usually the one with the highest crit chance.&nbsp; For the Sword and Shield TWF and the Sword and Shield Defensive build, the best option is the Scimitar.&nbsp; For the Two Handed Weapon Fighter, the best weapon is the Falchion (Elven Curved Blade is ok, I personally would NOT trade a feat for an average increase of .5 damage, but it does have a high crit range).&nbsp; If you go TWF with two weapons, the best combination is either Kukri/Kukri (light, high crit weapons in both hands) or Scimitar/Kukri.&nbsp; The former benefits more from feats like Improved Crit and Weapon Focus (as you only need to take them once).&nbsp; The latter is (marginally) better if one does not have those feats.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c33 c23 c20">More to come....</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c23 c20 c33"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Feat Choices:</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c20">Channel Smite:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Kind of like Smite Evil&#39;s younger cousin.&nbsp; The question is when you would use it because it takes away your third most precious expendable resource (first is smite, second is HP, 3rd are LoH usages).&nbsp; If you are smiting anyway, the damage doesn&#39;t seem that much of an improvement (1.75*level) on one attack.&nbsp; Ranged characters (who probably have extra LoHs to spare) can&#39;t use it.&nbsp; Two handed weapon users would get the most out of it (best chance to hit and fewer attacks) but have fewer LoH&#39;s to spare because of their low AC.&nbsp; It is probably best for a defensively built character with few attacks (no TWF) or a Lancer.&nbsp; The other stipulation is that it only works on undead.&nbsp; Unless your campaign is undead heavy (like Age of Worms) I would want more general use from a feat.&nbsp; More to the point, against the likes of the other feats I might choose at 5th+ level like Leadership or Improved Crit (you did choose a weapon with a big crit range right), I would probably not pick Channel Smite.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c11 c20">Deadly Aim:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Like Power Attack but even better because you get it over more hits (and you probably have a smaller strength score contributing to base damage).</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The use of this feat and its efficiency depends on numerous variables: how hard the monster is to hit, base damage, whether you are smiting, and level (which determines iterative attacks and the DA attack penalty).&nbsp; The following advice asks you to estimate the number you would need to roll to hit, counting rapid shot.&nbsp; So 19 means if you need to roll a 19 to hit with rapid shot.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Level&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

At higher level the calculation becomes much more difficult as it becomes more difficult to estimate average damage (because of wide variations is equipment).&nbsp; The general trend is that DA is best against low AC opponents and when your base damage is low.&nbsp; DA is a detriment against high AC opponents and when you have high damage before DA (an example of which is smiting).&nbsp; It is always good when you have to roll a 20 to hit.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c15 c7">Extra Lay on Hands:</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">This gives a couple more usages of a powerful core class ability.&nbsp; Consider this feat if: 1) Your build isn&#39;t feat starved for example: the Lancer after level 5 or so or the Defensive build AND 2) You are routinely&nbsp; in need of in combat healing AND 3) Someone else healing you isn&#39;t a better option.&nbsp; I would rate this feat better than toughness (this gives 3.5 hp/level in healing while toughness gives 1hp/lvl in max hp).</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c9">Extra Channel:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;If you are seriously giving this feat though, please, please consider Craft Wand.&nbsp; Channeling uses up lots of LoHs or this feat.&nbsp; It takes an action, unlike healing yourself.&nbsp; Even worse, unless you take selective channeling you heal the bad guys. That means that for the most part, you are using it out of combat.&nbsp; Taking Craft Wand lets you make a wand of Cure Light Wounds every 1-4 days.&nbsp; That wand has 275 hp of healing in it.&nbsp; Unless the whole party is injured after every fight, the healing from the wand is better or close&nbsp; from level 5-12 or so.&nbsp; The gold used to make the wand is pocket change.&nbsp; More to the point, out of combat healing really is a secondary or tertiary job of the paladin.&nbsp; You already have to put of decent damage and take hits.&nbsp; Unless your healer is slacking, I wouldn&#39;t reccomend this feat.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c14 c7">Extra Mercy:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;As I have said a couple times above, I think Lay on Hands is best used for in combat, self healing.&nbsp; Its side use to get rid of status conditions is a nice add on.&nbsp; If you are constantly getting hit with a specific status effect choose it as your next mercy or mitigate against it by improving your saves with equipment or just wait until you start facing different monsters.&nbsp; This feat sucks and sucks hard.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Improved Crit:</span><span class="c7 c11">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Great for anyone but the Lancer and Archer, and it is decent for them.&nbsp; Critical hits are dramatic boosts in damage especially when smiting.&nbsp; This is why I recommend high crit range weapons and improved Crit.&nbsp; You can get keen with Weapon Bond or as an actual weapon enchantment.&nbsp; The downside is that those do not stack with Bless Weapon which is a pretty good damage boost.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Power Attack:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Much better at higher levels and best for Lancer and 2H weapon users.&nbsp; Not as big of a boost for Sword and Board defensive characters, but honestly they need any damage boost they can get.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c9">Shield Slam:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This feat is really more useful for the trip moreso than the bullrush.&nbsp; Most of the time you want to monster close to you.&nbsp; My decision would depend on two main things monster size and fight locale.&nbsp; The feat is best against smaller foes and against those fighting in close quarters.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Step Up:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This feat removes the option casters have to take a 5&#39; step and cast, forcing them to make a choice between a somewhat difficult Concentration check to cast or to eat an AoO for actual movement or to try and use Acrobatics (I am sure that incentivizing wizards to take Acrobatics is an unintended consequence of the new Concentration rules and a hilarious one).&nbsp; The feat scales oddly (it is better at first level when casters have low ability scores and worse at high levels when they have high ability scores) and against some foes it is almost worthless (high level casters who have Combat Casting...which is kind of an NPC feat...so many NPCs).</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c15 c7">Toughness:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;I prefer Extra Lay on Hands for reasons discussed above.&nbsp; That said, toughness isn&#39;t an awful feat if you can spare one.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c15 c7">Weapon Focus:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;This feat works well for most builds, Lancers, 2H weapon users and and those fighting with matched Kurkris get the most benefit.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Critical feats:</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c15 c7">Bleeding Critical:</span><span class="c9 c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c9 c16">It only works after level 11 (the BAB requirement) and against things that do not heal.&nbsp; I would wait for Staggering Critical.&nbsp; Against casters, the hit point damage over time mechanic is probably weak - either they can heal or they have few hit points.&nbsp; Against mellee creatures, stagger is better</span><span class="c17 c16 c9">.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c16 c9 c17"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c9 c23">Blinding Critical:</span><span class="c16 c9 c26">&nbsp;</span><span class="c18 c16 c9">A solid effect, and the save is pretty competitive.&nbsp; Critical feats already only trigger on a crit, I want more reliability.
