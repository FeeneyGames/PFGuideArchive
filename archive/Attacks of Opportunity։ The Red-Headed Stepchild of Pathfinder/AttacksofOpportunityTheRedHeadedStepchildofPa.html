Requires either three levels of Hunter or the Horsemaster&rsquo;s Saddle, which is fortunately only 12k gold. Alternately, convince one of your friends to pick up Outflank. Only one other person needs to have it. Consider a lance if you&rsquo;re on horseback, otherwise you have free choice of weapon. </span><span class="c2 c20"><a class="c23" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items%23TOC-Magic-Items-Slots&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117784952000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1LyVnuXF5OC6quaYAG9_xM">Almost every kind of quadruped animal companion</a></span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;can technically wear the saddle and nothing says the rider has to be actually riding it for it to use the teamwork feats. Don&rsquo;t try this with a familiar - they&rsquo;re expensive to replace, don&rsquo;t have as much HP, and don&rsquo;t get bonus feats of their own.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">As a side note, familiars and eidolons can also qualify for this, but it&rsquo;s a little bit more difficult because of the necessity for feats and the saddle slot. However, familiars and eidolons are much more likely to have an extended critical range for Outflank, so its really up to you if you think they are worth it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">For unchained summoners, I recommend the Elemental subtype with the Quadruped base form for Mount (which makes sure the saddle works) and the movement speed versatility. Burrow, Fly, and 20ft are all very good options to help you flank faster and you can always give it arms and a weapon proficiency feat. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">For people with familiars...the hardest part is probably going to be making sure your familiar doesn&rsquo;t die too much, combined with finding one big enough to actually flank with you. Do remember that Evolved Familiar will allow you to put reach on one of your familiar&rsquo;s attacks for flanking fun. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Dweomercat Cubs have DR, 5ft reach, and a saddle slot (with pounce for icing). </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Nycar have regeneration and DR to keep them from dying, and a saddle slot but no natural reach. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Arbiters miss the reach again but have much better regeneration and technically come proficient with a short sword, which has a 19-20 crit range, but no saddle slot. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Shikigami have fast healing and DR, but they are more notable for the rule that, at DM discretion, you can trade out their natural feats for other feats. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Voidworms can cast blur on themselves and have fast healing and immunity to crit as well.

Strength Rangers and Urban Barbarians may also apply. Please remember that at 8th level, you can sell your +1 keen weapons and get Improved Critical instead.

The real kicker is that at level 3, you gain the ability to share one of your teamwork feats - chosen by swift action - with all of your friends within 30 ft. Since this is a paladin aura, it has no time limit, no number of uses per day, just a bonus that only works when you aren&rsquo;t flat footed.

A few bonus feats help relieve the feat starvation and a mount with the Horsemaster&rsquo;s Saddle makes a great teamwork partner. Charge-Overrun builds can get a lot of mileage out of Cavalier and it&rsquo;s a pretty decent choice for a Holy Tactician&rsquo;s second class. Special call out to the Strategist archetype, which allows for a longer-lasting preemptive sharing of teamwork feats for free. </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c2">Slayer (Vanguard)</span><span class="c6 c2">:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Vanguard Slayers, like Cavaliers, get the tactician ability with a single free teamwork feat.

Initiative bonuses and inability to be surprised are just icing on the cake. </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c15 c9">Hunter</span><span class="c6 c2">:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Hunters are a strong choice with their ability to cast buff spells and an animal companion that automatically shares all of their teamwork feats. This is the typical base for the dangerous duo build, and comes with some icing in the form of Animal Focus. Snake is available to most archetypes and gives a scaling bonus to and against attacks of opportunity - up to a +6 at level 15. Adding in bonuses from feats like Outflank (which you get for free) and Paired Opportunists, you and your companion can both have a +14 on your AoOs whenever you both threaten the same target. Delicious.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c15 c9">Inquisitor (Sacred Huntsmaster)</span><span class="c3 c2">:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Very much like the hunters, this archetype of Inquisitor gets later access to Animal Focus, Hunter&rsquo;s Tactics, all the teamwork feats of a normal Inquisitor, and a companion with no restrictions. The tradeoff is that instead of the early Animal Focus and a few other class features, Inquisitors instead get a single Domain and the extremely potent Bane ability (and a slightly different spell list). When you make several extra attacks per round, bane is pretty delicious and if you combine the Branded for Retribution feat with a team full of Paired Opportunists, you can get some sick damage. Unlike Hunters, who are restricted to some Neutral alignment and thus cannot also be Holy Tacticians, Inquisitors just need to be within 1 step of their deity. For domain choices, I suggest looking at </span><span class="c20 c2"><a class="c23" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5kvBvq2DEHjRWctNG05X0JINm8/edit&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117784962000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0fzR_0p36Uu0_kL_xN6_fD">Brewer&rsquo;s Guide to Reach Clerics</a></span><span class="c3 c2">.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c15 c9">Inquisitor (Monster Tactician)</span><span class="c3 c2">:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">A very different build from the rest, you rely heavily on summoning creatures that benefit from your teamwork feats. I would be wary of using this because of the sheer amount of time and micromanagement your one turn will require. This build becomes even more feat-intensive than normal because you add summoning feats into the fray as well, though you do still get some free teamwork feats. Later on this can make for a sick ranged build.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c2">Fighter</span><span class="c6 c2">:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Not surprisingly for a feat-intensive build, Fighters make a great choice both as a dip and as a full member. They can make decent tanks, especially if they enter the Stalwart Defender prestige class, or they can go for crit fiending with unparalleled access to critical feats. They also get access to Inquisitor&rsquo;s Solo Tactics for you loner beatsticks out there using Weapon Training. Lore Warden makes a surprise entry for a 2 level dip when they get Combat Expertise, prerequisite free, in addition to their bonus feat. Other archetype contenders are the Dragoon if you happen to have a mount, Phalanx Fighter for using a shield with your two-handed reach weapon, and Polearm Master for...well, for being good at anything polearm. Unbreakable works as a 1 level dip for people who want access to the Diehard tree. Tactician gives you late and limited use of the Cavalier&rsquo;s Tactician ability. </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Swash</span><span class="c8 c2">buckler (1+ levels)</span><span class="c6 c2">:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Mostly useful for the dual-wielding critter, the swashbuckler gains parry and riposte with wakizashis, weapon finesse for free, and a relaxation of Intelligence requirements for Combat Expertise builds. And that&rsquo;s just as a one-level dip, they also make excellent choices for a full build with bonus feats, bonus to initiative, and a smattering of nice defensive features. With the amount of bonuses specific to AoOs that you will get, you will be able to parry incoming criticals regularly to keep your skin intact. Keep your Cha decent for charmed life and panache. Mythic swashbucklers may also enjoy a combat maneuver build if they want to pick up Combat Trickery ability from the Trickster path.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c2">Brawler</span><span class="c6 c2">:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">The final class that ignores Intelligence, Brawlers are decent with most builds. Bonus feats are extremely welcome. Martial flexibility offers some utility for figuring out crazy situations, whereas the Mutagenic Mauler archetype can give you tons of strength and armor to hit everything that much harder and tank. Wild Child makes another choice for a deadly duo build, though getting teamwork feats onto your friend animal can be a bit of a pain. Two-weapon critters don&rsquo;t gain quite as much from flurry because there are no weapons a brawler can flurry with that have the full 19-20 crit range, so feel free to trade that out for something else. </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c2">Brawler (Exemplar)</span><span class="c6 c2">:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Special call-out for this archetype for buffer builds. Exemplar brawlers combo bardic performance with the Cavalier tactician ability for some pretty sweet party-wide buffs. Sadly they don&rsquo;t gain access to masterpieces so they can only share one teamwork feat at a time, but they can flex into any teamwork feat that is also a combat feat.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c2">Monk (3+ levels)</span><span class="c3 c2">: </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Preferably the Unchained kind for full BAB, this build will use a great number of feats and centers around using Ki Throw with improved maneuvers. Technically the feat path is open to other classes as well, but only monks are able to use it against creatures larger than themselves. Take a look at Flowing Monk, it gains the ability to make its victims flat-footed to make damn sure everyone&rsquo;s attacks of opportunity land. If you really need your will saves for some reason, and you are mythic, you can consider maxing out Bluff and grabbing the Combat Trickery path ability for Tricksters instead of having full BAB.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c15 c9">Vigilante (Mounted Fury)</span><span class="c8 c2">: </span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Vigilantes can do pretty much anything you can possibly imagine as long as you pick the correct archetype. This is your preferred pick if you are a dangerous duo. Mounted Fury gets the most feats of any possible build in the entire game, including some talents which give you entire feat chains for free and a twofer deal on teamwork feats and a mount that shares them. You don&rsquo;t get quite as much choice in animal companions as your Hunter friend, but you get 8 more feats to make up for it. Plus pseudo-pounce. Plus scaling extra damage on your two-weapon fighting.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c2">Vigilante (as a tank): </span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Did I mention that Vigilante does almost everything better than anyone else? Break out a reach weapon and prepare to break into Stalwart Defender. As long as you go Avenger, you get full BAB and as many feats as a fighter, plus some special benefits to some of those feats and a distinctly nice lack of prerequisites. With Vital Punishment, you can vital strike on an AoO once per round, including improved versions if you have them. With Shield of Fury, you can get Improved Shield Bash and skip TWF entirely if you wanted to Dorn Dergar with a shield. If you prefer to two-hand, you can grab Shield of Blades for extra AC from your Power Attacks. If you need Improved Unarmed Strike as a prerequisite for a style feat, grab Fist of the Avenger. Just in case, Shadow&rsquo;s Speed gives extra movement speed to make sure you get into position faster. Use Combat Skill as many times as you need to get feats that aren&rsquo;t free-with-icing already. The one and only downside is that you have no way of granting teamwork feats, so you can keep your AoOs to yourself and your 80ft reach.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c2">Vigilante (combat maneuvers): </span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">So yeah...Vigilante. Someone&rsquo;s beloved child at Paizo. Favored maneuver gives you any Improved maneuver you want, prerequisite free, with a circumstantial bonus. As many times as you want. Note that the nice-looking Brutal Maneuvers talent is actually a trap since it offers such heavy penalties. If you prefer the stalker specialization, you can pick up Leave an Opening for a guaranteed AoO any round that you actually hit something and the Sneaky Maneuver rogue talent to swift-action trip after booping them. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you grant teamwork feats because greater combat maneuvers make them provoke from everyone anyways.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c2">Vigilante (crit fishing): </span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Last one, I promise. Lethal Grace gives you some nice TWF support. Signature Weapon is a twofer deal on feats you already wanted. Vital Punishment, once again, gives you more damage on your inevitable AoOs. You can also go into the stalker specialization for a hit to your BAB but access to the Leave an Opening talent that gives you a free AoO, once per round per opponent hit. However, please note that stalkers do not get infinite free feats like avengers. This is probably the best way to do damage by yourself as a crit fisher. I still recommend a single-level dip in Swashbuckler to help your survivability with Opportune Parry and Riposte. </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bloodrager</span><span class="c3 c2">:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">There are multiple bloodrager bloodlines that offer increased reach while raging. This is for the two-handed hitters who want a few more AoOs and are the one class that doesn&rsquo;t require a reach weapon to regularly hit things 10 feet away. Also consider Arcane bloodline for tanking. Beware of feat starvation.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Barbarian</span><span class="c3 c2">:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Like bloodragers, usually the two-handed variant. Urban barbarians may apply to the dex-based builds, and mounted fury is an okay choice for deadly duos. Barbarians in particular are feat-starved and unlikely to gain the full benefits. </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c2">Bards and Skalds (1+)</span><span class="c3 c2">:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Surprisingly, bards end up filling the same niche as Holy Tactician and Cavalier due exclusively to the masterpiece </span><span class="c20 c2"><a class="c23" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard/bardic-masterpieces/masterpieces/battle-song-of-the-people-s-revolt-percussion-wind&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117784967000&amp;usg=AOvVaw30XLwIjnX0_8JElTVxWYOB">Battle Song of the People&rsquo;s Revolt</a></span><span class="c3 c2">, which gives you the ability to grant a teamwork feat as a bardic performance (Thank you, Jodokai). They can try their hand at a crit build with Dervish Dancer and Arcane Strike despite the &frac34; BAB or just go pure buffer. Duettist can also help the buffer by allowing early access to simultaneous bardic performances (usually a 4th level spell), and Totem Skalds can give some unique benefits. Technically speaking, you only need one level if you are willing to sacrifice a feat to grab People&rsquo;s Revolt. </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clerics and Oracles</span><span class="c3 c2">: </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">You have many different ways to go here, none of which are exceptionally good. Reach Clerics and Battle Oracles can grab a reach weapon and beatstick it up. If you take one level of Bard or Skald, the Divine Expression feat allows you full performance rounds on People&rsquo;s Revolt. The Community domain can let you hand out a teamwork feat to your melee friend. The variant negative energy channel for gods of Envy can force enemies to provoke if they fail their save. Battle Oracles can get free feats for one combat maneuver, very very slowly. </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c10 c9">All</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">of</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;the </span><span class="c8 c2">Above</span><span class="c1">????</span><span class="c22 c2 c11 c29">:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Technically speaking, several of the teamwork-sharing abilities stack. You can use a Holy Tactician&rsquo;s Battle Presence alongside a Cavalier&rsquo;s Tactician ability while you perform the Battle Song of the People&rsquo;s Revolt and summon a bunch of monsters with teamwork feats from Monster Tactician. If you want to do this, make sure you compare it to other possible builds to help determine just how many levels of pure class you can sacrifice before the worth of another teamwork feat is not sufficient. You can maybe consider this for Gestalt purposes.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c2">Reach Clerics, Battle Oracles, and anyone else using polearms:</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c3 c2">I can guide you to good feats and traits to augment your build. You probably have a bunch of other ones you want already, but these will help fill any gaps you might have.</span></p><p class="c5 c16"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h1 class="c12" id="h.s0ihzzh178ye"><span class="c21 c9 c28">The Way it Works</span></h1><p class="c16 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c2">The Basis:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">You and your friend or animal companion each get the feat Outflank. If you have an animal companion, Pack Flanking makes this easier. You set up a flank with your friend or companion. Whenever you score a critical hit, your friend gets a free AoO. If you both get Paired Opportunists as well, then you both get to take the AoO.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c2">But I&rsquo;m Ranged:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">I have just the feat for you. Target of Opportunity is a free attack that is extremely easy to trigger with the caveat that it is an immediate action instead of an attack of opportunity. Later on you can also take the Snap Shot/Improved Snap Shot feats to get in on Paired Opportunists anyways. </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c2">Making it Broken:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">The main drawback of this is the required feat investment. You and your friend have now both spent 2 feats to get some extra AoOs occasionally. If you&rsquo;re a pair of crit rogues, you&rsquo;re already set, but for most parties this will be lackluster. That&rsquo;s where the Paladin (Holy Tactician) and Cavalier classes come into play. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">If you can use your Battle Presence or Tactician ability to give Paired Opportunists to everyone, then suddenly your critical hit turns into an AoO for your friend, just like before, but now everyone on your team who is threatening gets to take an AoO alongside him because of Paired Opportunists. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">As a side note, any other method you have of making your enemy provoke an AoO, including Greater versions of maneuvers, Broken Wing Gambit, now will also grant the AoO to yourself and any team members that previously would have been left out.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c2">The Ki Throw path:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">This version instead abuses the Greater maneuvers that you can already use to make your enemy provoke by using multiples of them against the same enemy in a single round. It&rsquo;s extremely feat intensive for exactly one player. The feats required are as follows:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Improved Unarmed Strike - bonus, Combat Expertise, Combat Reflexes - bonus (1-2), Improved Trip, Greater Trip, Ki Throw - bonus (10), Improved Bull Rush - bonus (6), Greater Bull Rush, Spinning Throw, Improved Ki Throw, Vicious Stomp</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Because of the feat intensity, this build peaks around 11th level. It allows you to Greater Trip a target followed by a Greater Bull Rush that knocks another nearby opponent prone. Vicious Stomp and Greater Trip technically stack since one activates on a successful trip attempt and the other activates when an enemy falls prone. This should give up to 4 AoOs per turn, 1 of which is exclusive to you. Combine with the Style feats of your choice and enjoy.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c2">Riptide Version:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Thanks to some new feats coming out, there&rsquo;s another way to double down on combat maneuver-provoked AoOs. This is the Riptide build.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Feats: Dirty Fighting, Improved/Greater Trip, Power Attack, Improved/Greater Drag, Riptide Attack</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Extra Feats for bonus: Vicious Stomp, Combat Reflexes</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><h1 class="c12" id="h.fm75es7pxtef"><span class="c18">Attack of Opportunity Triggers</span></h1><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c16"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 357.00px; height: 360.07px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.jpg" style="width: 357.00px; height: 360.07px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c9">Enemy moving through your threatened range </span><span class="c3 c2">- This happens frequently with reach builds. Remember you can attack them in any one and only one of the threatened squares they pass through, except the one they entered. Talk to your DM, but I believe that if you AoO them with Paired Opportunists when they enter your allies&rsquo; threatened area, it provokes again if they continue their movement and provoke from your ally, resulting in multiple AoOs from each person on the same movement.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c9">Drinking a Potion/Extract or using a Scroll</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- as far as I know this cannot be done defensively and always provokes. I hate potions of Cure Moderate anyways</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c9">Standing from Prone</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- this is why Greater Trip/Overrun are better than their other counterparts. Keep in mind a few builds don&rsquo;t provoke when doing this.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c9">Using a Ranged Weapon</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- alchemical bombs and items, crossbows, rays, whatever. If it&rsquo;s ranged and they don&rsquo;t have a build that lets them not provoke doing it (looking at Gunslinger and Point Blank Master), it provokes. </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c9">Casting a Spell Non-Defensively </span><span class="c3 c2">- unlikely to happen unless they don&rsquo;t realize they&rsquo;re in a threatened area (which is why Greater Invisibility is awesome). Still provokes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c9">Escaping from a Net</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- for those of you who like that kind of thing, I suggest proficiency and the Net Adept chain, as well as a ghost-touch net.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c9">Picking Up or Retrieving an Item </span><span class="c3 c2">- an okay reason to use Disarm, also helps against the Wizard of Many Scrolls. Does not apply to wrist sheaths, weapons you are drawing, or spell component pouches.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c9">Using an Untrained Combat Maneuver </span><span class="c3 c2">- most of the time this won&rsquo;t matter, but against enemies with bad tactics feel free to murder them. Note that negative-channeling variant Envy clerics can force this unless your enemy makes a save.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c21 c9">Paired Opportunists </span><span class="c3 c2">- most of the following triggers only provide an AoO for some members of your team, rather than all. Paired Opportunists is the master feat that lets everyone who has it participate in the gang-up fun. Ask your DM about which interpretation he wants to use (strictly only ones that use the &ldquo;provoke wording? Anything that lets you make an attack roll against your opponent on your opponent&rsquo;s turn? Anything that uses the words &ldquo;attack of opportunity&rdquo; or uses up an AoO?)</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Ideally, you want your DM to decide that anything that allows you to attack your opponent or use an AoO on their turn qualifies for Paired Opportunists, but if you have to choose - Snake Fang or Bodyguard? All of the others fall into both categories.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c9">Using Greater Trip, Bull Rush, Reposition, Overrun, or Drag</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- some provoke from you and your friends, some only provoke from your friends. </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c9">Outflank or Seize the Moment with a Critical Hit </span><span class="c3 c2">- no, RAW these do not stack, Outflank requires you and your ally with this feat to be flanking, whereas with Seize the Moment you just have to both be threatening.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c9">Vicious Stomp </span><span class="c3 c2">- for all you unarmed strikers out there. Ask your DM if he will let you use a natural attack instead if that&rsquo;s your thing. Provokes from you alone, but on a very common trigger (opponent falling prone).</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c9">Bodyguard</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- falls under the &ldquo;ask your DM&rdquo; category. It does technically use an AoO to trigger but the actual action used is &ldquo;aid another&rdquo;. I personally wouldn&rsquo;t allow it but your DM might.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c9">Archon Diversion/Archon Justice </span><span class="c3 c2">- RAW this doesn&rsquo;t work, since the language says your allies get to take an AoO instead of that your enemy provokes an AoO. Should be fairly easy to convince your DM that they both mean the same thing, and technically you get up to 2 AoOs from the same attack here, since Diversion gives your ally an AoO for your enemy having the chance to strike you and Justice gives all of your allies an AoO when the strike is successful.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c9">Crane Riposte </span><span class="c3 c2">- a different style with the same RAW issue, this provokes from only you when you use your Crane Style successfully. Sweet and simple, but comes online later than Archon Style.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c9">Snake Fang</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- the third style to choose from, requires you to use an unarmed strike to make your AoO and, depending on how you interpret it, can also grant two AoOs to all of your friends. Ask your DM.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c9">Intrepid Rescuer</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- unless you are in a party of NPCs, this is probably too niche.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c9">Opportune Parry and Riposte</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- Swashbucklers can use an AoO and make an attack roll, it&rsquo;s not *exactly* RAW but it&rsquo;s pretty close, especially if you Riposte as well. Ask your DM.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c9">Fortuitous weapon enchantment </span><span class="c2">- I heard you liked AoOs, so I gave you an AoO on your AoO so that your team can gang up murder your enemies while they&rsquo;re already ganging up and murdering your enemies. You take the penalty, your friends do not. Not technically RAW, so ask your DM.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><h1 class="c12" id="h.fph2v7o7o2h0"><span class="c18">Feats</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c9">Individual Feats:</span><span class="c6 c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c2">Totem Beast </span><span class="c2 c9">- </span><span class="c3 c2">Do you have an animal companion?

Otherwise, its nice but not necessary.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c10 c9">Combat</span><span class="c2 c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c2">Expertise</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- Not so useful on its own, but an important prerequisite for Improved and Greater Trip, and also for the Stalwart tanking build and Butterfly&rsquo;s Sting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c10 c9">Com</span><span class="c7 c2">bat </span><span class="c8 c2">Patr</span><span class="c2 c15 c9">ol</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- How awesome this is depends entirely on what the rest of your party is doing with it. It&rsquo;s decent for people using reach weapons, especially ones with full BAB. If the rest of your party is a group of archers and wizards taking cover behind you, this is stupid amazing. Stalwart Defenders will love this twice as much. If your party likes to charge in and hit things, probably not going to mean much.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c2">Power Attack</span><span class="c3 c2">: A necessary prerequisite for drag, overrun, and bull rush. Also a pretty nice feat by itself for most builds.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c2">Improved, Greater Trip</span><span class="c2 c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c2">- Send your enemies prone and have them provoke on the way down for another shot. Beware of things with lots of legs or flying things. One important note - once you have Greater Trip you can use your AoO to make a trip attempt and grant yourself and your friends a free extra AoO with it. Trip is the only combat maneuver that can both cause an AoO with its Greater version and be used in place of any melee attack.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c2">Improved, Greater Overrun </span><span class="c3 c2">- an alternative to Trip for low-Int people with Power Attack. Still ends up with them prone and provoking. Look into getting this on your mount. If you really like overrunning with your mount, also look at Trample, Charge Through, Mounted Onslaught, and Vicious Stomp.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Improved, Greater</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Bull Rush</span><span class="c2 c9">/</span><span class="c1">Drag </span><span class="c2 c9">- </span><span class="c2">like Overrun in that it only requires Power Attack, but alters their position instead of knocking them prone. Not usually as good, although it still makes them provoke at Greater, Bull Rush becomes </span><span class="c17 c2">Green</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;when used with Spinning Throw (see Ki Throw section of How It Works for details) and Drag becomes </span><span class="c17 c2">Green</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;when used with Riptide Attack.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Improved, Greater Reposition</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- Like Bull Rush and Drag in outcome, but still requires Combat Expertise. Ew</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c15 c9">Two-Weapon Fighting,</span><span class="c8 c2">&nbsp;Improved, </span><span class="c7 c2">Greater</span><span class="c2 c24">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c2">- if you&rsquo;re playing a two-weapon character, you take the two-weapon feats. Str Rangers may also look at Double Slice. They get successively less useful as the chance to hit with that last shot goes down, keep in mind that a critical threat that isn&rsquo;t a natural 20 still has to hit the enemy&rsquo;s AC to be a threat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Butterfly&rsquo;s Sting</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- When your friend has Outflank (or a Scythe) and you don&rsquo;t. Also required for the Seize the Moment feat. Requires Desna as your god.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c2">Improved Critical</span><span class="c17 c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c2">- Crit fiends love it, everyone else probably just wants to buy the weapon enchant. Prerequisite for Seize the Moment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c2">Critical Focus, Critical feats</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- Again for the two-weapon crit build, add some extra debilitating effects and confirm even on a 2.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c2">Boon Companion</span><span class="c2 c9">/</span><span class="c8 c2">Horse Master</span><span class="c2 c15 c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c2">- Do you like having a pet that&rsquo;s actually fully leveled? This helps. Horse Master notably always uses your character level whereas Boon Companion works on any kind of animal, but only covers 4 levels of multiclass.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nature Soul/Animal Ally</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- Another odd way to get an animal companion, this is usually your worst option since you cannot have an existing animal and it requires two feats. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Intrepid Rescuer</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- an odd feat that requires worship of Kurgess. It gives you an extra AoO every time an enemy attacks an NPC or helpless ally. This is more of a situational feat for Martial Flexibility than anything else, unless for some reason you have a lot of NPCs around in combat. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c15 c9">Leadership</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- If your DM allows this feat, it is broken. Get a nice tanky follower that has teamwork-feat-sharing abilities and have him stand somewhere close to melee. This is a great way of doing an all-of-the-above build: share 3 teamwork feats with everyone and his brother without sacrificing a single class level. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c10 c9">Endurance</span><span class="c2 c9">/</span><span class="c1">Diehard</span><span class="c2 c9">/</span><span class="c8 c2">Stalwart</span><span class="c2 c9">, </span><span class="c2 c15 c9">Improved</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- For tanking builds only. It does also require Combat Expertise, but it will give you stupid high DR. Endurance and Diehard are only particularly useful in conjunction with Stalwart. Ignore this if you aren&rsquo;t going tank.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Darting Viper/</span><span class="c7 c2">Dorn-Dergar Master</span><span class="c2 c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c2">- if you&rsquo;re using the Dorn-Dergar as your reach weapon, Darting Viper can help you switch from reach to non-reach faster and DD Master can allow you to use a shield and one-hand it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c2">Riptide Attack</span><span class="c3 c2">: If you have both trip and drag feat chains, this can get pretty nice. Be careful of flying or otherwise untrippable foes. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c2">Vicious Stomp</span><span class="c2 c9">: </span><span class="c3 c2">If you are able to use your weapon with one hand and have Improved Unarmed Strike, this is another way for you to get a free AoO after a successful maneuver.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c10 c9">Vital</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;Strike, </span><span class="c2 c10 c9">Impr</span><span class="c7 c2">oved, </span><span class="c2 c10 c9">Gre</span><span class="c7 c2">ater</span><span class="c2 c9">: </span><span class="c3 c2">Exclusively for Vigilante, who can vital strike on an AoO. This works best for high-damage weapons like the Lucerine Hammer, Dorn Dergar, etc.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c14">Style Feats:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Archon Style/</span><span class="c7 c2">Archon Diversion</span><span class="c1">/</span><span class="c7 c2">Archon Justice</span><span class="c2 c11">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c2">- This might be passable for a tank option if it didn&rsquo;t require a free hand, as it is you probably want to be two-handing or holding a shield in your off-hand instead. Archon Justice and Archon Diversion do trigger an AoO once per round, but it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily make up for the rest of the chain. I&rsquo;ve seen some good uses for it for Sacred Shield paladins whose primary goal is preventing allies from taking damage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c2">Crane Style/</span><span class="c7 c2">Crane Wing</span><span class="c2 c9">/</span><span class="c8 c2">Crane Riposte</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- This style suffers from the same free hand problem as Archon Style, with a slightly more selfish set of abilities. If you happen to be wielding one-handed somehow, this is good for tank builds. You may actually get more out of this than the Stalwart line, especially early on or if you&rsquo;re not Intelligence-oriented. Sadly, Crane Wing got nerfed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c7">Snake Style</span><span class="c8 c2">/</span><span class="c1">Snake Sidewind</span><span class="c8 c2">/Snake Fang</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- The middle feat is a bit on the boring side, and otherwise this is fairly similar to the Crane Style, except that it doesn&rsquo;t require defensive fighting and is less likely to block a hit. Snake Fang gets bonus points for letting you hit a second time on your AoO, although technically this won&rsquo;t stack with Paired Opportunists. It also, if you read closely, can be used to make an AoO multiple times per round. (Thanks, Scott!)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c2">Panther Style</span><span class="c2 c9">/</span><span class="c2 c15 c9">Panther </span><span class="c8 c2">Claws</span><span class="c2 c9">/</span><span class="c7 c2">Panther Parry</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- RAW they aren&rsquo;t technically AoOs, but any leniency at all on your GM&rsquo;s part for interpretation will work here. You get a number of free retaliatory attacks equal to up to your Wisdom modifier with the second feat of the chain and mess up your opponents&rsquo; attacks too with the third. Panther Claw effectiveness varies depending on the number of AoOs you expect your enemies to have. (Thanks, Gregory Connolly!)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wolf Style</span><span class="c2 c9">/</span><span class="c7 c2">Wolf Trip</span><span class="c2 c9">/</span><span class="c2 c10 c9">Wolf Savage</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- Wolf Style is an okay 1 feat dip for defenders with high strength, simulating the Stand Still feat at reach range. It doesn&rsquo;t get super great unless you have high damage output or only attack things with slow movement speeds. Wolf Trip makes a nice addition to Greater Trip, and Wolf Savage is probably useless unless you are a Monk as well. I suppose it is possible to be a monk using a reach weapon to flurry, but that&rsquo;s the only scenario in which all three of these feats would be useful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c2">Brute Style</span><span class="c2 c9">/</span><span class="c2 c10 c9">Brute Stomp</span><span class="c2 c9">/</span><span class="c2 c10 c9">Brute Assault</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- It won&rsquo;t give you a lot, but if for some reason you happen to be doing unarmed strikes with reach this gives you a wider area to AoO. The next two feats are much more focused towards doing damage by yourself.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c14">Teamwork Feats: </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c2">Outflank</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;- A solid building block for anyone in melee, Hunters actually get this feat for free at second level. The bonus to flanking is worth on its own, but the AoO on an ally&rsquo;s crit is what makes two-weapon crit fishing a viable option for these builds. If you&rsquo;re using it in conjunction with Paired Opportunists, this feat becomes </span><span class="c2 c15">purple</span><span class="c3 c2">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seize the Moment</span><span class="c2 c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c2">- a late-game outflank for people who are bad at flanking. You lose out on the bonus to hit but gain the ability to AoO off a crit regardless of flank position. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c15 c9">Paired Opportunists</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- Most people just see this as &ldquo;oh I get +4 to AoOs. Nice.&rdquo; and stop reading there. That&rsquo;s nice but that is ICING compared to the real part: whenever an ally gets an AoO, any other ally gets to also make an AoO. That means that any effects that grant one person an AoO now grant it to everyone. These effects include Outflank, the Fortuitous weapon enchantment, reach weapons, Unexpected Strike for Barbs and Stalwart Ds, and potentially opportune parry and ripostes. Consult your DM on that last one, though. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Target of</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;Opportunity</span><span class="c17 c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c2">- If you don&rsquo;t happen to need your swift action for anything, this allows a ranged attack that isn&rsquo;t technically an AoO whenever someone else also makes a ranged attack. Easy to trigger in the right party, useless in the wrong party, and of ok usefulness when it happens.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Broken Wing Gambit/</span><span class="c2 c10 c9">Wounded Paw Gambit </span><span class="c3 c2">- This has an annoying prerequisite and doesn&rsquo;t work against intelligent targets very well. It also only works once per round, even if your opponent falls for it. The second feat is for ranged attacks only. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c10 c9">Pack</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c2">Flanking</span><span class="c17 c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c2">- Are you a Hunter, Mounted Fury, Sacred Huntsman, and/or person with a Horsemaster&rsquo;s Saddle? Congratulations, you are now always flanking. Enjoy your Outflank bonuses. Otherwise, you can&rsquo;t benefit from this feat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c10 c9">Blades Above</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c7 c2">and Below</span><span class="c2 c17">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c2">- This is similar to Pack Flanking in that it allows your allies to always flank. The problem is that it is now conditional on 1. You having an ally in a different size category and 2. Someone being the same size as your enemy. Don&rsquo;t expect to use this against a Tarrasque anytime soon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c10 c9">Harrying</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c2">Partners</span><span class="c17 c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c2">- This is a godsend for Bodyguard abusers. Now the AC bonus you grant lasts for a whole round! Much less useful if your DM rules that Bodyguard as an action doesn&rsquo;t trigger Paired Opportunists.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c10 c9">Lookout</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;- a nice feat that&rsquo;s pretty difficult to actually use. Even with a divination wizard or similar in the party, it&rsquo;s usually not worth it for everyone in your party to sink a feat just to get into the surprise round. Tactician doesn&rsquo;t really cut it unless you know for a fact you&rsquo;re going to be running into an ambush in the next 18 seconds, but for the Holy Tactician this feat suddenly becomes </span><span class="c17 c2">Green</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- you can take it for your full team and switch it off as soon as initiative rolls. Bonus points if you have Uncanny Dodge or Defensive Strategist and can use it when you are also surprised. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Escape Route</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- Another niche teamwork feat, this one is useful to have against reach enemies or if everything goes to hell and your whole party needs to get out fast. Extremely convenient for mounted characters as you will never eat an AoO again. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shake it Off</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- like Lookout, this is a feat you probably will only use outside of combat. It&rsquo;s very convenient if you&rsquo;re running into a lot of traps or environmental hazards. Uses in combat are fairly limited since the party is likely to be more scattered. If at least 3 people in your party get it, it&rsquo;s about the same as all three of them getting Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes, and Great Fortitude - which is decent but very unexciting. </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><h1 class="c12" id="h.hle39d9h16u1"><span class="c18">Traits</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Fencer (Combat) - +1 to Attacks of Opportunity with swordlike weapons</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Fight with the Flock (Race - Werebat) - a good reason to be Adopted, gives a +1 to AoOs whenever you are within 10 feet of two allies.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Finish the Fight (Race - Half-Orc) &nbsp;- +1 to attack against anyone you already hit today. Good stuff.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Temple Guard (Regional) - wonderful because it&rsquo;s not a combat trait, this is +1 to AoOs for polearms.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Bullied (Combat) - +1 to Attacks of Opportunity with unarmed strikes (thanks, Scott)</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Defensive Strategist (Religion - Torag) - Uncanny Dodge in a trait. Useful for Holy Tacticians, whose teamwork aura doesn&rsquo;t work while flat-footed.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Weapon Style (Faction) - Gives you proficiency with one monk weapon. If for some reason you only have proficiency with simple weapons, this is how you get a reach-trip weapon.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Opportunistic (Religion) - +1 to Attacks of Opportunity with whips, swords, and daggers. </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><h1 class="c12" id="h.br6xpgbi5l0x"><span class="c18">Equipment</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c9">Weapons</span><span class="c3 c2">:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c2">Meteor Hammer</span><span class="c2 c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c2">- A good choice for anyone, you can switch this between a reach weapon and a double weapon. You should be able to two-hand it either way, so just view it as reach that you can switch to not-reach when the enemy gets too close. Gives a few extra bonuses for AC and tripping.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c2">Dorn-Dergar</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- Another reach weapon that can switch to non-reach, Dwarves are automatically proficient. It takes a bit longer to switch than the meteor hammer, but deals more damage. Can be used one-handed with a shield with a feat investment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c2">Elven Branched Spear</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- the really exciting parts are the +2 to AoOs and the potential to finesse it. A good choice for elves, who get it as a martial weapon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">La</span><span class="c8 c2">nce</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- Are you on a mount? Do you charge? Meet your best friend. Also martial rather than exotic, so easier to pick up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c2">Fauchard</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- a decent exotic reach weapon with an 18-20 crit range, this is the halfway point between a normal build and a crit fishing build. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dwarven Longhammer</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- if you don&rsquo;t like having backup plans for when people get close, this has a large damage die. Dwarves are again automatically proficient.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Double-Chained Kama</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- the highest damage monk reach weapon for you flurry people. Has a few nice extra traits.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Guisarme</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- another martial reach weapon, this one has trip as well. Probably the best for people with neither a mount nor an exotic proficiency.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Naginata</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- for samurai. I&rsquo;m still not sure why you gave up tactician if you&rsquo;re looking at this guide.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c2">Wakizashi</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- the only weapon that is 18-20, light, and piercing. Recommended for swashbucklers doing crit builds for compatibility with panache. Also convenient for samurai, but I don&rsquo;t know why you&rsquo;d go samurai and give up tactician.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c2">Kukri</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- if you&rsquo;re doing a crit build without levels of swashbuckler, this one is still light and 18-20, plus doesn&rsquo;t require exotic weapon proficiency.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c9">Weapon Enchants</span><span class="c3 c2">: Usually it&rsquo;s ok to go straight +1 to +5,, but these are worth consideration.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c2">Answering</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- for swashbucklers with wakizashis. Put this on one and enjoy a +5 whenever you parry and riposte, which will be often.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c15 c9">Fortu</span><span class="c1">itous</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;- once per round, make a second AoO after the first with a penalty. Your friends with Paired Opportunists take no such penalty and the feat mostly negates it anyways. Cheap and will often straight-up double your damage between rounds. Drop this to </span><span class="c2 c11">Orange</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;if your DM rules the second attack does not trigger Paired Opportunists.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c2">Keen</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- you know why you want this already.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c2">Menacing</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- if you have multiple allies (including your companion) who have Outflank, this is a great way to get even more bonuses to hit. Pack Flankers will love this. </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c14">Wondrous Items: </span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c2">Horsemaster&rsquo;s Saddle </span><span class="c3 c2">- give your quadruped animal companion all of your teamwork feats for free. Absolute gold.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c2">Sable Company Elite Saddle</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- a little more expensive, but works better for flying mounts. Still gives them all of your teamwork feats.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c2">Ring of Tactical Precision</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- give one of your allies one of your teamwork feats on a limited basis. You need to recharge it every 24 hours, but it works. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c2">Banner, Commanders</span><span class="c2 c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c2">- improves the Tactician feature immensely. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vambraces of the Tactician</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- the Commander&rsquo;s Banner for people who have a different banner. Not quite as nice, but occupies the little-used wrist slot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c2">Resplendant Uniform Cloak</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- Better than the Vambraces, cheaper than the Banner. Instead of increasing the duration of your Tactician, you get one extra use per day. I find that more useful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c2">Dire Collar</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- a nice way to give your animal friend reach and size once per day, pretty cheap too. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c2">Juggernaut&rsquo;s Pauldrons</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- at will enlarge person for all of your reach needs! Comes with some pretty snazzy benefits too, including ferocity and the ability to use Deadly Juggernaut (a 4th level spell!) as an immediate action 3 times per day. The price makes it a mid to late-game item, and being a shoulder slot hurts. Ask your DM if you could have Juggernaut&rsquo;s Pantaloons or something instead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c2">Cloak of the Hedge Wizard (Transmutation)</span><span class="c2 c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c2">- another way of grabbing enlarge person 1/day. Still a shoulder slot, but a lot cheaper. Note that it costs the same as 50 battles with a potion, so consider those as well.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c14">Other Items:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c2">Potion of Enlarge Person or Longarm</span><span class="c2 c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c2">- Use with a spring-loaded wrist sheath at 50gp a pop. More reach is better reach, and statistically speaking if it takes you 10 battles to level up each time, and you use one every battle, it still only costs you 5k by level 10. Not a bad deal. Keep a longarm or two around in case of cramped space.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c2">Wand of Enlarge Person</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- it&rsquo;s quite a bit cheaper than the potion, but takes a full round and potentially a UMD check each use. I&rsquo;d stick with potions.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c16 c31 title" id="h.uj2spohakrni"><span class="c26">Mythic Campaigns</span></p><h1 class="c13" id="h.g6rkvsbtrvl4"><span class="c18">Mythic Feats</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c15 c9">Combat Reflexes</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- Also known as how to dump dex in an AoO build.

If your DM hates that you have a crit build and gave everyone fortification then it goes back up to being kinda nice. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c2">Dual Path</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- You&rsquo;ll probably know if you need this. It lets you take two different mythic paths&rsquo; abilities. Note that Tricksters can already take a single path ability from someone else with Path Dabbling.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c2">Improved </span><span class="c8 c2">Critical</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- Get a bit more damage out of each crit. This favors people with big weapons or big modifiers. If you are doing Butterfly&rsquo;s Sting, your scythe-wielding friend will enjoy this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c2">Improved </span><span class="c1">Drag</span><span class="c7 c2">/Trip/</span><span class="c1">Bull Rush</span><span class="c7 c2">/Reposition/Overrun/</span><span class="c8 c2">Grapple</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- these are all cookie cutter copy-pastes of each other. A moderate bonus to combat maneuvers is nice. Grapple is suddenly blue because your enemy now provokes every single time they try to grapple you. Including when they try to regain control of the grapple you put them in. Grappling suddenly became a viable AoO technique!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c2">Vital Strike</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- for vigilantes with the Vital Punishment talent, or people that need their move action every round for something else. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c2">Legendary Teamwork</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- If only this was listed as a teamwork feat so that you could tactician it! Still offers some nice bonuses to Paired Opportunists and Outflank. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c2">Extra Path </span><span class="c8 c2">Ability</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;- You can take a path ability that gives you an extra feat or a feat that gives you an extra path ability. I like to take this at tier 3 because you get a feat right as you unlock a new set of path abilites, but you can play around with it.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><h1 class="c13" id="h.gu47nm7qs79z"><span class="c18">Mythic Paths</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c4">To save you from having to read massive walls of text, I am going to sort out preferred paths by build here. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9">Dangerous Duo:</span><span class="c3 c4">&nbsp;Guardian path for defenses and utility, Champion path to help with crits. If you happen to have a good domain, you can substitute Heirophant for Guardian. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9">Crit Fiend</span><span class="c3 c4">: Champion all the way. The Marshal path might help if you want to be more of a team player. If you have sneak attack, you might want to consider Trickster as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9">Tank</span><span class="c3 c4">: Guardian has everything you ever wanted. Marshal can offer some extra bonuses, including the broken Aura of Perserverance combo with a Deathless-casting Legendary Item. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9">Ki Throw</span><span class="c3 c4">: The bad news is that this just doesn&rsquo;t get a lot of support anywhere. The Champion path can help a little and the Trickster path, surprisingly, also helps a lot IF you are willing to invest heavily in Bluff. You probably want to cherry pick Titan&rsquo;s Bane, Ever Ready, and Combat Trickery or Maneuver Expert and just get a lot of Extra Mythic Feats and a sweet Legendary Item.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9">Buff Build</span><span class="c3 c4">: Marshal path will let you buff people beyond their wildest dreams. Also consider the Divine Source, Legendary Item, and Mythic Spellcasting universal path abilities. </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c4"></span></p><h2 class="c13" id="h.h9i5a58snad0"><span class="c19 c9">Universal abilities</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c4">Unfortunately, most universal path abilities provide bonuses against non-mythic enemies. If you are in a mythic campaign, it&rsquo;s a damn good bet that at least the bosses you fight will be mythic. That means that these abilities will be useless precisely when you need them the most.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c9">Tier 1</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Extra</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c7">Mythic</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">Feat</span><span>&nbsp;- The exact opposite of Extra Path Ability but with similar uses.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c9">Legendary Item</span><span class="c3 c4">&nbsp;- This is so stupidly broken. The spellcasting ability alone is worth its weight in gold because it allows you to snipe choice spells off of whatever spell list you so please. I particularly enjoy pulling wordspells like Accelerate, since they are buffs you won&rsquo;t see from any of your normal party members. Metamagician can make it even sweeter. Undetectable can combo with Greater Invisibility to bypass truesight so you can keep your enemies flat-footed forever. Foe-biting is some nice extra damage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c11 c9">Mythic</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c7">Spell</span><span class="c8">cas</span><span class="c15 c9">ting</span><span class="c3 c4">&nbsp;- Varies heavily depending on what spell list you have and what spells you choose. There are other guides that cover this.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c9">Tier 3</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Divine Source</span><span class="c3 c4">&nbsp;- This varies in effectiveness depending on the domains you choose and how fast your mythic tier is increasing. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c9">Enhanced</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c11 c9">Ability</span><span class="c3 c4">&nbsp;- An extra +2 to your main stat is nice, but hardly comparable to the other options you have at tier 3. There might be some niche uses for extremely SAD characters.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c4"></span></p><h2 class="c13" id="h.ce6t5loujya"><span class="c19 c9">Champion abilities</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c4">Champion is a good go-to particularly for crit-fishing builds, as it has a bounty of bonuses for them. It doesn&rsquo;t work quite as well for the tank or the dangerous duo. </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c9">Champion&rsquo;s Strike</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Fleet Charge</span><span class="c3 c4">&nbsp;- The most widely useful option, this gives you pseudo-pounce with a free extra attack that ignores DR. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Sudden Attack</span><span class="c3 c4">&nbsp;- This does not help with positioning nearly as much as Fleet Charge, but it does give you roll-twice-take-better. Therefore it makes you much more likely to crit with your 15-20 crit range. </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c9">Tier 1</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c9">Backlash</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c4">- I want to like this because it gives you an AoO, but the trigger condition is downright awful. You have to 1. Get crit, 2. Survive the crit, and 3. Be able to hit the enemy that crit you. Having all of this happen is neither likely nor beneficial.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c11 c9">Clean Blade </span><span class="c3 c4">- Sickening critical is cool, and this is basically a stronger variant on that. Is it worth a path ability? Maybe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Crusader</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c4">- See Leadership feat for details. Note that many path abilities are worth more than a feat. The surge bonus isn&rsquo;t worth a whole lot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Ever Ready</span><span>&nbsp;- Now this is the kind of bonus we like! Depending on your tier, this can replace Mythic Combat Reflexes with a scaling bonus on your AoO rolls as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c11 c9">Always</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c9 c11">a Chance</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c4">- On a related note, you get lots of bonuses on AoOs and they use your max BAB. You probably CAN hit on a 1, if it didn&rsquo;t automatically fail you. This is how you fix that, if the 5% chance to miss was killing you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c9">Impossible</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c7">Speed</span><span class="c3 c4">&nbsp;- If you have trouble positioning due to your movement speed, this will help. Otherwise you probably have better things to do with your life. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Titan&rsquo;s Bane </span><span class="c3 c4">- Later on in your career, you will probably be fighting big things. This helps you hit them and keeps them from hitting you as well.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c22 c7 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c9">Tier 3</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Disabling Strike </span><span class="c3 c4">- This is downright awesome for a crit-fishing build. Your crits can do Con damage and completely disable your enemy&rsquo;s limbs. Mythic enemies get a save but can still be affected. Ask your DM about disabling atypical limbs like noodly appendages. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c11 c9">Maneuver Expert</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c4">- Spend mythic power to gain improved and greater insert-maneuver-here. This might be useful early on in the ki throw build, before you&rsquo;re able to get all the feats you want. You&rsquo;d have to retrain it later, though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Maximized Critical </span><span class="c3 c4">- I don&rsquo;t need to tell you why you want this. I can see a crazy Butterfly&rsquo;s Sting-Mythic Vital Strike build in here. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c9">Precision</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c4">- Again for crit-fishing TWF builds. It won&rsquo;t take away the -2/-2 for dual weilding but it will make your (example 11th level) BAB look like +9/+9/+9/+9/+4/+4 instead of +9/+9/+4/+4/-1/-1.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c9">Tier 6</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Critical Master </span><span class="c3 c4">- Much love for crit fiends here. Select it twice, never roll confirmation again. If you had Mythic Critical Focus, you can go retrain that now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c11 c9">Sweeping Strike</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c4">- This is mega-cleave for reach builds. I&rsquo;d like to rate it higher but it has the typical cleave drawback that it only works when you are fighting a bunch of mooks you could probably kill already. It has no effect on boss battles unless your enemy is a summoner. </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c4"></span></p><h2 class="c13" id="h.5lofzgi2q9w1"><span class="c19 c9">Guardian abilities</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c4">Not surprisingly, guardian abilities are particularly useful for tanky builds. They also have some nice utility and defensive abilities for the dangerous duo.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c9">Guardian&rsquo;s Call</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c11 c9">Sudden</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c7">Block</span><span class="c3 c4">&nbsp;- If you have free swift actions, this can save your allies&rsquo; butts. However, as a tank, you really shouldn&rsquo;t be letting people target your allies anyways. It can work as a band-aid when shit hits the fan.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Absorb Blow</span><span class="c3 c4">&nbsp;- DR or damage reduction mostly on-demand. This still requires a swift action, so beware. </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c9">Tier 1</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Adamantine Mind</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c4">- There aren&rsquo;t a lot of things that can disable a good tank. Most of the things you are still susceptible to are mind-affecting, though. This gives you bonuses against fear, compulsion, illusions, and all the other annoying things that keep you from doing what you want to do. The stun is a nice bonus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c11 c9">Armored Might </span><span class="c3 c4">- The bonuses to your armor are fairly negligible compared to what your AC should be, but a little more never hurt.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c9">Avenging Maneuver</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c4">- I want to like this because it gives you an AoO, but the trigger condition is downright awful. You have to 1. Get crit, 2. Survive the crit, and 3. Be able to succeed at a combat maneuver against the enemy that crit you, and 4. Be in range to use a combat maneuver on them. This is even worse than Backlash.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c9">Draw Fire</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c4">- Just get an Arrow Catching shield. Smaller range, but it doesn&rsquo;t eat your precious swift actions and is literally a +1 enchantment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Ever Ready</span><span class="c3 c4">&nbsp;- Now this is the kind of bonus we like! Depending on your tier, this can replace Mythic Combat Reflexes with a scaling bonus on your AoO rolls as well. Just as good for Guardians as it was for Champions. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c11 c9">Irrepressible Soul</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c4">- Unless you happen to be immune to fear, Adamantine Mind is probably better. Unlike Adamantine Mind, this requires mythic power and you have to have already failed your save once. It also gives you a reroll instead of a bonus, which after tier 4 is statistically worse. Plus it&rsquo;s restricted on what it protects against.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Mythic Companion</span><span class="c3 c4">&nbsp;- Finally, something to help out the dangerous duo build. I believe this also qualifies them as mythic for the purposes of not getting auto-failed on abilities that target non-mythic creatures.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c9">Pack</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c7">Wild</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c15 c9">Shape</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c4">- Pros: everyone in your party can now have a reach of 20 feet for AoO goodness. Cons: requires someone to be a druid, and that someone is probably not you. Also not very helpful in caster-heavy parties.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Retributive </span><span class="c15 c9">Reach</span><span class="c3 c4">&nbsp;- Yes please and thank you. 5 extra feat of threatened area is actually a massive increase to your threatened zone regardless of what your current reach is, because area = reach^2</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c9">Tier 3</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Cage </span><span class="c15 c9">Enemy</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c4">- This is absolutely glorious if you don&rsquo;t need your swift action. It actually takes the best feature of the Stalwart Defender prestige class and flat-out gives it to you. Note that Stalwart Defenders can still enjoy their Bulwark and Unexpected Strike abilities.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c11 c9">Drive</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c11 c9">Back</span><span class="c3 c4">&nbsp;- Do you have Greater Bull Rush? This is nice. Like most cleave effects, it has the sad drawback that it has no effect on single-target boss fights.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Impervious Body/</span><span class="c8">Impervious Companion</span><span class="c3 c4">&nbsp;- Again for the dangerous duo, being in melee can be bad for your health and your buddy&rsquo;s. Your companion is a natural target since your teamwork feats won&rsquo;t work if one or the other of you falls. This helps prevent that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c9">Turn the </span><span class="c7">Tables</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c4">- Much like Avenging Maneuver, this offers too little benefit and is too situational. When was the last time an enemy tried to use a combat maneuver on you, and failed? This turns green if you built to grapple since your opponents have to maneuver check you just to get out.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c9">Tier 6</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Companion Power </span><span class="c3 c4">- Your animal companion just got more reach. Duos everywhere rejoice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c11 c9">Impas</span><span class="c7">sible</span><span class="c3 c4">&nbsp;- Some more bonuses to your favorite Tier 3 ability. If you have Greater Trip and your enemy is trippable, this can be pretty nice. It is still fairly lackluster compared to its parent ability.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c9">Indomitable</span><span class="c3 c4">&nbsp;- Immunity to crippling conditions sounds great. Unfortunately, you only get to pick one. This would be viable if you could pick a number equal to your tier or even half your tier. If you can convince your DM to do that then the tier list for condition prevention is something like: confused, frightened, dazed, staggered, blinded, everything else.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c11 c9">Mythic Resolve</span><span class="c3 c4">&nbsp;- Spend mythic power to make clutch saves. This is a nice nat-1 protection, but you probably have better things to do with your life.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c4"></span></p><h2 class="c13" id="h.yse6eyxwbpwz"><span class="c9 c19">Heirophant abilities</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c4">This is mostly here for the occasional reach cleric or battle oracle that steps in on the AoO game. </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c9">Divine Surge</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Inspired Spell</span><span class="c3 c4">&nbsp;- Cast any spell that you could possible know. The sheer utility of this ability makes it far and away the best choice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Beast&rsquo;s Fury </span><span class="c3 c4">- Fleet Charge for your animal companion. You still need to get in position yourself.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c9">Tier 1</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Mythic Companion</span><span class="c3 c4">&nbsp;- Just like the Guardian path ability. Give your companion a surge, and I believe this also qualifies them as mythic for the purposes of not getting auto-failed on abilities that target non-mythic creatures.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c9">Pack</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c7">Wild</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c15 c9">Shape</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c4">- More Guardian path stuff. Same pros and cons.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c9">Tier 3</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Blessed Companion</span><span class="c24">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c4">- Similar to Impervious Companion, except that it applies to only your animal companion and not yourself, but doesn&rsquo;t require another path ability.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c11 c9">Domain</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Immunity</span><span class="c24">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c4">- This is a very unique defensive ability. Try doing the Magic domain, which basically makes you immune to dispel magic, antimagic field, and a whole slew of other anti-caster stuff. Charm - Lust gives you immunity to most of the nasty compulsion spells. Darkness - Loss or Death - Undeath protects against enervation and energy drain. Madness protects against confusion, insanity, and variations on phantasmal killer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Enduring Blessing</span><span class="c3 c4">&nbsp;- If you take it twice, it suddenly applies to all of the polymorph spells. I suggest Monstrous Physique IV so that you can maintain your armor and weapons while still gaining reach and some sick abilities.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c9">Tier 6</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c11 c9">Overcome</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c11 c9">Curse</span><span class="c24">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c4">- Dual-cursed oracles will appreciate this. Even regular people will enjoy being immune to Greater Bestow Curse. Unfortunately it is pretty limited in scope. </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c4"></span></p><h2 class="c13" id="h.apopxpo6rf6u"><span class="c19 c9">Marshal abilities</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c4">This is wonderful for bards and skalds, and pretty decent for cavaliers and the occasional dual-path tank. You end up giving massive action economy and bonuses to everyone in your party. Endgame here is that you can round-1 give everyone within 30 feet of you 10 rounds with an extra attack, extra move action, immunity to fear death and unconsciousness, a ton of bonuses to whatever roll they please, and of course a teamwork feat.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c9">Marshal&rsquo;s Order</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Advance </span><span class="c3 c4">- Fleet Charge for...everyone! Minus the attack, at least. Everyone gets to move into position at the cost of one of your swift actions. That is some mad action economy right there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Decisive Strike </span><span class="c3 c4">- Fleet Charge for someone! This one includes the attack but is less useful because it affects fewer people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Rally</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c4">- Give everyone some extra luck on their next turn. This is great for clutch situations mid-fight.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c9">Tier 1</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Additional Order</span><span class="c3 c4">&nbsp;- Honestly all three orders have their uses. I would pick up Advance and Rally and leave Decisive Strike though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Clarion Call </span><span class="c3 c4">- Usefulness depends on what your challenge/smite does, obviously. This can be anything from a CHA deflection bonus to something that only works on your mount.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c9">Directed Assault</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c4">- Another windfall for a crit fisherman. You can keep your crit and give it away too! This is like Butterfly&rsquo;s Sting on steroids and since each crit provokes an AoO, it is a free attack for everyone as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c9">Inspired</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;Defense </span><span class="c3 c4">- This is a great buff for your bard with Inspire Courage. Unfortunately, if you are using Inspired Courage it usually means that you are not using Battle Song of the People&rsquo;s Revolt, thus defeating the entire purpose of the teamwork feat build. If you have a way of performing two songs at the same time, this goes back up to green.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Lightning Performance </span><span class="c3 c4">- For low-level bards or ones who have more mythic power than available actions on the first round of combat. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Loyalty </span><span class="c3 c4">- See Leadership feat for details. Note that many other path abilities are worth more than a single feat. Champion&rsquo;s Crusader ability is comparable but better.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Mounted Marshal</span><span class="c3 c4">&nbsp;- Pack Flanking with icing. If you expect to be charging a lot, this can be pretty nice. You might be able to swing some stupid damage from Spirited Charge/Mythic Vital Strike/Mounted Marshal/Butterfly&rsquo;s Sting/Maximized Critical if you want to dual path. This is completely unrelated to AoO&rsquo;s though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Painful Gambit</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c4">- Step 1: intentionally provoke from an enemy. Step 2: destroy them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Perfect Aid </span><span class="c3 c4">- This is another bit of tank support for people who use their AoO on Bodyguard. You should be able to increase your buddy&rsquo;s AC by a pretty decent chunk now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Tactical Genius </span><span class="c3 c4">- A free teamwork feat and pseudo-Solo Tactics. Plus you can change it each morning. If you are looking for free feats with icing, this is one of the better icings.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c9">Tier 3</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Aura of </span><span class="c8">Perseverance</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c4">&nbsp;- I usually view diehard-type abilities as a great way to get yourself murdered. However, this one can be combined with a particular mythic spell called Deathless to make you and your friends within 30ft a juggernaut zombie army. Teach it to your legendary weapon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c11 c9">Dispel Fear</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c4">&nbsp;- This is fairly situational, but one thing that will definitely stop all of your friends from taking advantage of all the AoOs you give them is a mass fear effect. If you are using Aura of Perseverance+Deathless, this can also get them killed as they run away with -300 hit points. If you think you can wait, I&rsquo;d recommend grabbing Words of Valor from Tier 6 instead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c9">Glorious Charge</span><span class="c3 c4">&nbsp;- This looks cool on paper but in practice it is about equivalent to the Advance order you got 3 tiers ago, except less malleable. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Word of Hope </span><span class="c3 c4">&nbsp;- At first glance, this looks a lot like the Rally order. Then you realize that it applies once per round for multiple rounds, making it mostly better. The caveat is that it requires a standard(!) action instead of a swift. If you can hold off getting Rally until tier 3 this is probably worth it.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c9">Tier 6</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c11 c9">Inspiring</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">Assault</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c4">&nbsp;- The multi-turn version of the Advance order, with the ability to attack instead of move. This one is slightly dependent on you at least attempting to attack or harm your enemy, though, and the haste clause can be problematic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Unswerving Loyalty </span><span class="c3 c4">- The kind of immunity that we like. It might eat an immediate action but it provides flat immunity to the worst debuffs at the potential cost of a mythic power. No rolls, no chance to fail, just straight-up immunity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Words of Valor </span><span class="c3 c4">- This is some more action economy lubricant. Multi-round version of Dispel Fear, mass heroism, and extra surges for everyone, all at the cost of a single standard action for you. </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c4"></span></p><h2 class="c13" id="h.8w2uk8ol62bz"><span class="c19 c9">Trickster abilities</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c4">This path has some decent abilities for crit fishers and potentially combat maneuver builds. I would look at it more as a candidate for Dual Path than anything else, unless you have a whole lot of sneak attacks or somehow got a 15-20 crit range on a kinetic blade. </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c9">Trickster&rsquo;s Attack</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Fleet Charge </span><span class="c3 c4">- Just as good for tricksters as it is for everyone else. Enjoy your free pseudo-pounce.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Surprise Strike</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c4">- More copy pasta from other paths. </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c9">Tier 1</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c11 c9">Aim for the Eye</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c4">- Much like Clean Blade from the Champion order, it looks pretty nice but has a lot of potential to just not be useful. Ranged sneak attacks are nice, but you shouldn&rsquo;t be built for them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c11 c9">Combat</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;Trickery </span><span class="c3 c4">- You can pump the Bluff skill to death far easier than you can pump your CMB to death. The problem is that if you are going the Ki Throw build, the only build that really uses this, you just made yourself Cha-dependent as well. It is a nice way of getting cleave that still benefits you on single-target fights.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Deadly Dodge</span><span>&nbsp;- This would be bonkers if it didn&rsquo;t require mythic power. Since it does, I can only give it a green. Keep in mind that the attack just has to miss you </span><span class="c30">somehow</span><span class="c3 c4">, not necessarily because of the dodge bonus. So displacement, opportune parry and riposte, etc all work for getting you that free AoO. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c10">Down Like</span><span class="c11 c9">&nbsp;Dominoes</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c4">- Cleave trip! Unfortunately you take a cumulative penalty for each person you cleave, you&rsquo;d better hope they aren&rsquo;t immune to trip, and it has no effect on single-target boss fights. Altogether that makes this a bit of a trap ability.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">No One of Consequence </span><span class="c3 c4">- This gets an obligatory call-out just for the nondetection ability. As long as your abilities don&rsquo;t depend on your allies being able to see you, this prevents invisibility spells from being penetrated most of the time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15 c9">Path Dabbling</span><span class="c3 c4">&nbsp;- This is equivalent to the best ability you could pick for any path at the tier you are currently at. I highly recommend Directed Assault or Inspiring Assault from Marshal, Retributive Reach or Cage Enemy from Guardian, and Ever Ready, Maximized Critical, or Precision from Champion. If your DM lets you take this more than once, absolutely do it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Titan&rsquo;s Bane</span><span class="c3 c4">&nbsp;- Just as good for you as it is for the Champions. Possibly a little better, if you happen to have sneak attack from somewhere. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Treacherous Critical </span><span class="c3 c4">- I want to like this, but it requires you to have two distinct lines of feats: the crit fishing set, which is already pretty demanding, and a combat maneuver set for either reposition or trip. Ask your DM how it combines with automatically confirmed crits if you have them. </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c9">Tier 3</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c11 c9">Fickle </span><span class="c8">Attack</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c4">- How many damage dice do you roll on your turn? Take that answer and multiply it by 0.5. That is the amount of damage per round you gain from selecting this ability.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c11 c9">Mirror Dodge</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c4">- Do you have abilities that trigger when an opponent misses? Spend power to trigger them more often. Honestly, unless you are running Snake Style this probably isn&rsquo;t worth the power. </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c9">Tier 6</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c11 c9">Class Mimic</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c4">- It has some restrictions, so the usefulness of this really depends on what your friends have for their classes. Look at your friends&rsquo; auras, bloodline abilities, revelations, and martial abilities. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Precision Critical </span><span class="c3 c4">- If you have sneak attack, you might as well add it onto all of the criticals you will be getting. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c11 c9">Slayer&rsquo;s </span><span class="c7">Cyclone </span><span class="c3 c4">- As far as cleave abilities go, this one is pretty sweet. You can move between each attack, use your full BAB, and make a number of attacks equal to the number of enemies present plus one. &nbsp;The restrictions are pretty easy to deal with. Its good enough to get it to half-green, which is pretty high for an ability that you can&rsquo;t use on single target fights.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Unending Performance </span><span class="c3 c4">- At first glance you would think that you should use this ability for a bardic performance. However, a technical reading suggests that it also applies to buffs that are extremely strong and intended to only last one round. For instance, the Destructive Smite power from the Destruction domain gives a morale bonus to damage rolls equal to half the cleric&rsquo;s level. The Orc bloodline&rsquo;s first level power is even stronger, applying the same power to three types of rolls. Don&rsquo;t have a domain or a bloodline? There&rsquo;s a feat for that...</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c4"></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c6 c21">Sample Builds</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c6 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c2">Kelly the Crit-Fisher (Level 3, 6, 11)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Kelly is a half-elf with the Ancestral Arms trait to grant her proficiency with the wakizashi. She uses the Fencer trait to help her AoOs and has a friend with the Outflank feat and a scythe with a x4 critical. Her other trait is Defensive Strategist for her planned levels of Holy Tactician. She is on a 20 point buy and allocated her stats as follows:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Str 14, Dex 17, Con 14, Int 7, Wis 12, Cha 15</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">At level 3, Kelly has two levels of Lore Warden to give her access to Combat Expertise and fill in a few of her early core feats. Notice that she effectively has two feats per level by utilizing dip feats. She just took her first level of Swashbuckler, with a panache pool of 2 for parrying. Once per round, when she scores a critical hit, she can instead let her scythe friend take it for a huge amount of damage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Feats: Combat Reflexes (1), Two Weapon Fighting (Fighter bonus), Combat Expertise (Lore Warden), Butterfly&rsquo;s Sting (Fighter bonus), Weapon Finesse (Swashbuckler), and Weapon Focus (3). </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">At level 6, Kelly continues to fish around with various classes to complement her build. She takes 3 levels of the Holy Tactician class, grabbing some charisma-friendly goodies and Battle Presence. She doesn&rsquo;t get as many feats, but she makes sure to take Outflank at level 5 with her friend. Her 4th level stat bonus goes to Dexterity, rounding it to 18. She uses Paired Opportunist with her friend to get extra attacks whenever her 3 attacks with keen wakizashis score a critical. She still passes off one critical per round to her friend since it doesn&rsquo;t matter whose turn it happens on - the AoO occurs anyways.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">New Feats: Outflank (5), Paired Opportunist (Holy Tactician)</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">At level 11, Kelly&rsquo;s opening build is pretty much complete. She takes a short jaunt into the Mutagenic archetype of Brawler to give her bonuses to her dexterity and take Improved Critical at level 8 before heading back into Swashbuckler for the bonus initiative, AC, and extra save bonus once per day. Her level 8 stat bonus goes into Charisma to give her extra panache and saves. Also, her criticals that she keeps now make her enemies sickened and she almost always confirms. She trades out her old Keen wakizashis for an Answering one and a Fortuitous one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">New Feats: Improved TWF (7), Improved Critical (Brawler bonus), Critical Focus (9), Lookout (11), Sickening Critical (Swashbuckler bonus)</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Including standard magical gear for her level, her AoO&rsquo;s now strike at 11[BAB]+6[Dex]+1[weapon enchant]+5[AoO bonus]+1[Weapon Focus] for a total of +24. If she is using her answering weapon to parry and riposte, that instead becomes a +28 for a pretty decent chance to wash away an enemy critical.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c14">David the Huntmaster (levels 3, 6, 11)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">David the Human is primarily a Hunter, although he does take a jaunt into Cavalier for the Tactician ability and some nice Order stuff. He has a pet Allosaurus that functions as the party&rsquo;s primary tank. He wields a Fauchard for the extra crit range for Outflank while staying a bit farther to the back so that enemies focus more on the heavily armored dinosaur. His stats are much more strength-focused than Kelly&rsquo;s:<br>Str 17, Dex 14, Con 12, Int 13, Wis 14, Cha 8</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">At level 3, David is pure Hunter. He didn&rsquo;t want to delay his floating teamwork feat at all, or his Hunter&rsquo;s tactics, and is mostly focused on building a base for his animal companion to be a beast. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Feats: Combat Reflexes (1), Outflank (Hunter bonus), Pack Flanking (Hunter floating), Combat Expertise (3)</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">At level 6, David has a strong base and has taken his 2 level Cavalier dip pretty seriously. The Beast Rider archetype lets his Hunter levels stack with Cavalier for advancing his companion. He chooses the Order of the Dragon to help his allies, since he is almost always threatening and the aid another bonus helps him be viable outside combat. His 4th level of Hunter gives him access to second level Hunter spells as well. He puts his 4th level stat increase in Strength and starts looking closely at a Trip build. His Fauchard is now Fortuitous to give his pet an extra smash every time he crits on it, and a Keen Edge wand or friendly caster helps him do that more often.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Feats: Paired Opportunists (Tactician), Improved Trip (5)</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">At level 11, David is immensely enjoying his second animal focus and, in fact, likes it so much that he got his pet Allosaurus an extra focus to help out with the tanking. His pet&rsquo;s focuses are usually Bull and Tiger to increase its main stats. All of his remaining levels go into Hunter and he has 3rd level spells already, which he can use with relative impunity due to Escape Route and reach. He got himself a Str/Dex belt to increase his number of AoOs and Greater Trip to take advantage of it. A Commander&rsquo;s Banner lets him give all of his friends Paired Opportunists twice per day instead of once, and its more likely to last a full combat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Feats: Totem Beast - Snake (7), Escape Route (Hunter bonus), Greater Trip (9), Critical Focus (11), Shake it Off (Hunter floating)</span></p></body></html>
