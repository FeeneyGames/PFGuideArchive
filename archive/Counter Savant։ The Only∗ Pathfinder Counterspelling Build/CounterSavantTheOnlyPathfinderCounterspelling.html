There is only one build in Pathfinder that will let you counterspell with any reasonable level of success. And before you ask, no this is not The Best Build You&rsquo;ll Ever See&trade;. The Counter Savant build will impress you with how reasonable it makes counterspelling seem. This build stretches as high as it can to </span><span>attain</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;the vaunted status it gets, namely the ability to actually compete with a properly-built spellcaster. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">By its very nature, counterspelling in Pathfinder is inefficient in almost every regard. This guide is meant to demonstrate that the Counterspell is not entirely doomed to eternal ridicule, and that a build centered around it has actual potential. I still must stress you must understand before you read any further that counterspelling is bad, and this build is not so much &ldquo;good&rdquo; as it is &ldquo;making the absolute best of something not great.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">So how bad can it be?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"><br>Every time it seems that the concept of counterspelling comes up in a forum thread everyone ubiquitously condemns it for being a horrible idea. And this is not without good reason. Normal counterspelling is a bad strategy at best, and literally useless at worst. Many casters don&rsquo;t even properly know how the ability works because it so rarely matters. In my five years GMing Pathfinder I have never seen a single spellcaster ever attempt a counterspell. Why is that, you ask? It&rsquo;s because counterspelling uses too much of your action economy when there are so many better ways to deny a caster his spell. Just to name a few, here&rsquo;s a short list of all the common ways to negate enemy spellcasting:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><ul class="c15 lst-kix_4djs15xd2rk5-0 start"><li class="c4 c7 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Dealing damage</span></li><li class="c4 c7 li-bullet-0"><span>Grappling</span></li><li class="c4 c7 li-bullet-0"><span>Readied actions</span></li><li class="c4 c7 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Effects that cause vigorous motion (strong winds, most combat maneuvers, etc.)</span></li><li class="c4 c7 li-bullet-0"><span>Effects that blind </span><span class="c14 c2">(blindness-deafness, glitterdust)</span></li><li class="c4 c7 li-bullet-0"><span>Effects that deafen </span><span class="c2">(shout, </span><span class="c3">thunderstones)</span></li><li class="c4 c7 li-bullet-0"><span>Effects that silence </span><span class="c14 c2">(silence, suffocation, etc.)</span></li><li class="c4 c7 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Threatening squares</span></li><li class="c4 c7 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Disruptive feat</span></li><li class="c4 c7 li-bullet-0"><span>Immediate action spells (</span><span class="c2">emergency force sphere, stone shield, etc.)</span><span class="c3"><br></span></li></ul><p class="c4"><span>You could devote builds exclusively devoted to any of these concepts and likely see more success than this build will ever see at its primary function. Nothing displayed above wastes one of your spell slots and a standard action just to succeed at blocking a spell. Not to mention, any build focused on options above has the added benefit of actually being effective against non-casters; a department in which the Counter Savant falls very short. The Counter Savant is very much a niche build and you should attempt playing one fully understanding this.<br><br>Now with all that said, is building a Counter Savant really </span><span class="c2">that</span><span>&nbsp;bad?</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span>No. This build is not bad, and in fact is pretty solidly in the &ldquo;good&rdquo; category from all the tricks we do to remedy the problems with counterspelling. I just needed to make sure that everyone understands in no uncertain terms that the Counter Savant is not going to be the awe-inspiring spectacle that the hexcrafter is, or the have the insane flexibility as the God Wizard does. Besides, the true savant of spell duels doesn&rsquo;t fight with flashy flair, but with a reserved, calculating poise. The Counter Savant excels the most when facing an enemy caster, but falls short in pretty much every other regard. &nbsp;Basically what I&rsquo;m saying is you&rsquo;re never going to be &ldquo;amazing&rdquo; and you&rsquo;re going to have to live with that.</span><span class="c3"><br></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Why play a Counterspeller, then?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>Counterspelling is at its most fun when you are able to completely and utterly shut down every possible option your opposing caster has. There&rsquo;s nothing quite like seeing the look on your GM&rsquo;s face after his Big Bad has lost his fourth spell in a row to your magical shenanigans, knowing full well there is </span><span class="c2">nothing he can do about it</span><span>. Playing a Counter Savant also gives you the unique opportunity to be a caster that can impart a noticeable impact on an encounter even when it is not your turn. You will be able to watch every spell as it is cast and play God, constantly deciding if the incoming spell is even worth your time. When you&rsquo;re around, spells are only cast because you </span><span class="c14 c2">allow them to be.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>Counterspelling also has a fair bit of risk to it, as you are depleting your resources much faster than a normal caster would. Instead of casting just one spell per round, the Counter Savant must carefully manage the use of his daily counter abilities in addition to having to manage a </span><span>daily </span><span>spell pool decreasing at twice the normal rate. Playing a suboptimal build like a counterspeller presents a unique challenge no other spellcasting classes don&rsquo;t offer. This tight management of spells and daily abilities </span><span>makes</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;you really consider if a spell is worth countering or not, and often your judgement in this regard will completely change how a given encounter plays out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">How Counterspelling Works</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">As a refresher, normal counterspelling has three parts to it, broken up as follows:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c33 c39">Ready Action</span></p><ul class="c15 lst-kix_m3sr41fjq8jm-0 start"><li class="c4 c7 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">You must ready a standard action to counterspell. You may use your move action however you wish. You must specify a target that you wish to attempt to counterspell.</span></li></ul><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c14 c2">The first reason why counterspelling normally sucks is the requirement to ready an action. You not only put yourself later in the initiative order (which, as a caster, you very much don&rsquo;t want to do), but you also use up your standard action for the turn. Unless you&rsquo;re casting Quickened spells, or have a spell that uses your move action, you don&rsquo;t get to do the one thing your class usually does. Additionally, having to specify just one target means that in the case where you have multiple casters, you might not need to/be able to counterspell the correct target. After all, if the enemy doesn&rsquo;t cast a spell, you&rsquo;ve essentially wasted your entire turn.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c39 c33">Identify Spell</span></p><ul class="c15 lst-kix_l1vadk38j69s-0 start"><li class="c4 c7 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">You must make a Spellcraft check equal to 15+the spell level.</span></li></ul><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c14 c2">This is pretty easy-peasy, and with even a small amount of focus will be trivial in no time. Making a Spellcraft check was never why people didn&rsquo;t counterspell.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c39 c33">Use Spell Slot</span></p><ul class="c15 lst-kix_pwnukfj33irj-0 start"><li class="c4 c7 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">You must use a spell slot containing the same spell, or a specific diametrically-opposed counter.</span></li></ul><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c14 c2">This, in case you couldn&rsquo;t tell, is insanely restrictive. Maybe back when the Core Rulebook had maybe 4 spells per school per level (of arcane spells) you might happen to have the same spell a bit more often, but now that you have literal thousands of spells to work through you&rsquo;re simply never going to realistically be able to rely on this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c14 c2">Improved Counterspell helps a lot with this, making the same-spell requirement into a same-school requirement. With this feat, you can reasonably carry a spell from most schools and have a decent chance of having a spell slot to burn. But as mentioned before, those are spell slots you normally would be casting to help the battle anyway, and likely could have just been used as readied actions to force a concentration check.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">OK, so 3 steps, got it. What about </span><span class="c5 c38 c2 c43 c44">dispel magic?<br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Dispel magic</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;is a bit of a different case, and one that the Counter Savant makes heavy use of.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>The first two steps to countering a spell with </span><span class="c2">dispel magic </span><span>are the same. The difference is after you identify the spell, you make a dispel check instead of simply using a spell slot. Your dispel check is equal to 1d20+your caster level+any bonuses that increase caster level. The DC is 11+the spell&rsquo;s caster level. What this means in essence is that you&rsquo;re only using a 3rd level slot (or 6th in the case of </span><span class="c2">greater dispel magic</span><span class="c3">), in exchange for having a chance to fail. Assuming you&rsquo;ll usually be facing a caster of roughly your level, you&rsquo;ll usually have approximately a 50% chance to pass any given dispel check. Usually.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Ok that&rsquo;s definitely enough exposition. Onto the build with you.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><h1 class="c4 c26" id="h.ux4tuce4hmde"><span class="c10">The Build</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">I will be using the standard color-convention for this guide. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c30 c5">Light Blue</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;options are practically required.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c20 c5">Blue</span><span class="c20">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">options are very good.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c5">Green</span><span class="c5 c25">&nbsp;</span><span>options are good.<br></span><span class="c5 c19">Orange </span><span>options are situationally good.<br></span><span class="c17 c5">Red </span><span class="c3">options are bad.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><h1 class="c4 c26" id="h.2q9igoz96d1t"><span class="c10">Classes</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">I will only be covering one class for the Counter Savant, as it is the class from where he gets his name. All of the blue classes besides the main one below share a lot of overlap, so they&rsquo;ll mostly apply to this guide as well. Note that a lot of what class option is best lies entirely in your GM. Both their interpretation of certain munchkinry and their expected character progression rate should be factors to consider when choosing a class for your Counter Savant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c20 c5">School Savant Arcanist</span><span>-</span><span class="c35 c5">&nbsp;</span><span>The School Savant Arcanist is going to be the focus for this build. Most of the reasoning for this is explained in the next section, but the gist of the build is that we will be using the Counterspell subschool in addition to the counterspelling chain of exploits to get as many immediate-action counterspells as possible, and we need as many of those as we can get. </span><span>The draw to this particular combination of features is in the access to Greater Exploits, free Improved Counterspell, extra spells prepared, and the abusable Counterspell Mastery class feature. This class is best for GMs who don&rsquo;t allow Fiendish Proboscis, but do allow the Heighten Spell trick. </span><span class="c3">You wanted a counterspeller, so why not go all the way?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c18 c35 c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Other Options:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c18 c35 c5"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c20 c5">Exploiter Wizard</span><span>- Exploiter is kind of nuts, to be frank. I&rsquo;ve been seeing this idea floating around about people suggesting an exploiter wizard over abjurer for a counterspelling build and honestly, as much as it pains me to say, I can sort of see why. The pros are you&rsquo;re going to be a full level of casting ahead and you get a whopping 5 feats for free, including access to arcane discoveries. The cons are that you lose your familiar, school, and a daily school spell slot in exchange for your version of Arcanist&rsquo;s exploits. But the real kicker is that RAW the exploiter wizard does not get access to the Greater Exploits, which include some of the best tools in the counterspeller&rsquo;s arsenal. Instead of playing around with nifty Greater Exploits, you&rsquo;ll be straight up maxing out your </span><span class="c2">dispel magics </span><span class="c3">to be as absurdly strong as you possibly can. Exploiter Wizards are greatly benefitted by permissive GMs allowing the Fiendish Proboscis cheese and are benefited by having more spells per day than any arcanist will. Exploiters with adequate points in their reservoir will hardly miss the Counterspell Mastery class feature.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c5">Arca</span><span class="c20 c5">nist</span><span class="c3">- If the idea of giving up exploits until your fifth level makes you uncomfortable, I&rsquo;m with you. Going without an archetype is arguably comparable in power, as you&rsquo;re trading more versatility with your exploits in exchange for a spell per day and the Counterspelling wizarding school. Not to mention you don&rsquo;t have to pick two whole opposition schools. And let&rsquo;s be honest, straight Arcanist probably strictly a better build power-wise than the School Savant since it doesn&rsquo;t put every chicken it has into the counterspelling basket. But if you&rsquo;re here to counterspell you may as well just go with the option above. I&rsquo;d only recommend straight arcanist if you fear that your campaign is going to die out before you get to 8th level or so. And in that case, just go Exploiter. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c5"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c5">Spell Warrior Skald</span><span>- So ok, this class gets a bunch of features for counterspelling. And I&rsquo;ll be damned if they really do look nice. You&rsquo;re getting two incredible feats for free, and by level 10 you&rsquo;re also getting immediate action casting. The big downside is your spell progression is only 6th level, meaning you&rsquo;re going to be letting a lot of spells by, and at low levels the number of spells you have to work with is drastically diminished. Build a Spell Warrior if you want to be able to be effective in combat and out of combat like any normal character, with the added benefit of being able to counterspell every once in awhile. The Spell Warrior is basically the Counter Savant with a ton of extra class features to play around with, but at the end of the day it is not a pure counterspeller. I&rsquo;d suggest looking to another guide if you are interested in playing a Spell Warrior.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c18 c5 c19"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c19">Abjurer Wizard</span><span class="c3">- You elect to completely forego exploits in favor of just sticking with your Counterspelling school. Really, you&rsquo;re just getting into the territory where you&rsquo;re a wizard specializing in one of the worst schools, who happens to be able to counterspell every once in awhile. This is like dipping your toes in the water and saying you&rsquo;re swimming. I mean yeah you&rsquo;re going to be safe there on the pier, but can you really call yourself an athlete?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c18 c5 c19"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c19">Sorcerer</span><span class="c3">- Actually not strictly worse than the abjurer wizard, funnily enough. Having access to more spells per day and spells known instead of prepared means you won&#39;t be depleting your counterspelling resources quite like the other builds would. Plus you don&rsquo;t have an opposition school to worry about. Just pick the Arcane bloodline, pray your GM allows the Heighten Spell trick with Metamagic Adept, get Improved Counterspell for free and pretend you&rsquo;re Michael Phelps along with the Abjurer up there. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c18 c5 c19"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c17 c5">Anything else</span><span class="c3">- I don&rsquo;t want to hear it. Whatever weird bard-song spamming, half-druid/half-witch stuff you&rsquo;re trying to pull will not work, and does not count as you being a counterspeller. As far as I know, no divine caster has any class feature that deals with counterspelling, and anything not a 9th-level caster will never be able to effectively counter the most important spells it needs to. There&rsquo;s some bard and warpriest archetypes that sort of feel like counterspellers, but really they&rsquo;re just glorified debuffers with the Improved Counterspell feat slapped on. Counterspelling for them is a side gig. You want to be the main event. And anything else that you could want to do with another class would just be done better by something listed above.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><h1 class="c4 c26" id="h.sr1atffqf4t3"><span class="c10">The Big Idea</span></h1><p class="c4"><span>So remember how I said counterspelling normally sucks because it wastes your standard action? The Counter Savant doesn&rsquo;t care about standard actions. The entire premise of the Counter Savant build revolves around two things: Your counterspell exploit and your Counterspell Mastery school power. Both of these abilities are used as immediate actions, at the cost of spells of one level higher than the spell you are countering (until you get your Greater Counterspell exploit). Counterspell Mastery is important for later because of some truly weird stuff you can do with Heighten Spell. The rest of the build is centered around buffing your </span><span class="c2">dispel magic</span><span>&nbsp;(or </span><span class="c2">greater dispel magic </span><span class="c3">if you plan on playing high-level) to increase the chance of success of your counterspell exploit, to be useful with its native counterspelling option, and to be used as an all-rounder support spell that can lower saves and stun.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>Now I know what you&rsquo;re thinking. Yes, </span><span>it</span><span>&nbsp;seems pretty pricey constantly having to give up higher slots when your class is already one spell level behind, </span><span>but that&#39;s </span><span>the price you have to pay. The benefit of having multiple counterspells per day as immediate actions means you don&rsquo;t have to delay your action every time you want to counter, allowing you to cast like normal (or even ready a second counterspell!) and just letting the counterspells happen on the enemy&rsquo;s turn. Additionally, when done this way, you can be sure you&rsquo;re only countering the spells that are going to hurt the most. If the effectiveness of this seems dubious, think of it this way: Quicken Spell makes your spell four levels higher so it&rsquo;s cast as a swift action. By using a slot one spell level higher to counter as an immediate action is like getting your normal standard action spellcasting in addition to a </span><span class="c2">quickened dispel magic </span><span class="c3">every time you&rsquo;re faced with a spell that concerns you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><h1 class="c4 c12" id="h.xtnmwdaws4lv"><span class="c10"></span></h1><h1 class="c4 c26" id="h.2qjvfaoh8f2z"><span class="c10">Viability</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>At low levels, the Counter Savant is about as viable as a wizard with no feats or traits. The Counter Savant build starts to come online formally at level 6 when </span><span class="c2">dispel magic </span><span>is first acquired, after which it&rsquo;s effectiveness only grows. It is most viable at mid-to-high-level play, around levels 13-17. The level of your campaign and personal preference will determine whether you focus on </span><span class="c2">dispel magic </span><span>or </span><span class="c2">greater dispel magic</span><span class="c3">. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>Because high-level play is much less common, for the remainder of this guide I will be assuming you choose the infinitely-more accessible </span><span class="c2">dispel magic </span><span>as your focal spell. Focusing on a 6th level spell is really not possible for the vast majority of most campaigns. But if you&rsquo;re given the chance to just whip up a 13th+ level Counter Savant, by all means devote yourself to </span><span class="c2">greater dispel magic </span><span>in its place</span><span class="c2">. </span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><h1 class="c4 c26" id="h.qrtl32prj0e1"><span>Ability Scores</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c20 c5">Int</span><span>&gt;</span><span class="c11 c5">Con</span><span>&gt;</span><span class="c11 c5">Dex</span><span>&gt;</span><span class="c11 c5">Ch</span><span class="c5 c19">a</span><span>&gt;</span><span class="c5 c19">Wis</span><span>&gt;</span><span class="c18 c17 c5">Str</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c18 c17 c5"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">Intelligence </span><span class="c3">is the most important both for your extra spells per day and for your Spellcraft checks. Your level-up bonus should always go here.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">Constitution </span><span class="c3">is obvious, as living is nice, not-living is not-so-nice.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">Dexterity </span><span class="c3">is important for going first, which can be the difference between the fighter getting dominated or not. You cannot take immediate actions when flat-footed, which is important to remember coming up.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">Charisma </span><span class="c3">is usually pretty nice for Arcanists, but in our case we&rsquo;re going to be too exploit-starved to really use it. Extra uses of Consume Spells is nice, but as a counterspeller you&rsquo;re going to be burning through spells more than most. If you want to branch out and use a few exploits that need Cha it&rsquo;s not going to kill you. Aim to keep at 12 or 14.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">Wisdom </span><span class="c3">is basically the don&rsquo;t-get-charmed stat.

Most of these traits do things that require twice as many feats to achieve, and we&rsquo;re so feat-taxed as it is we need to lighten the load wherever we can. Which is a shame because traits usually add a lot of depth to your character&rsquo;s backstory, and it seems kinda lame that almost every Counter Savant has to be adopted by Dwarves from Erages. And this is something I&rsquo;m especially sad about, because I think traits are a wonderful addition to Pathfinder that too often just get used explicitly to min-max instead of being used for their original intent. I guess I have to be a hypocrite here...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">So yeah, there are a lot of traits that are really good out there that would be fine additions to any build, but again you just don&rsquo;t really have the room for any of them. The traits below in particular all directly impact your build and as such you should only be choosing from traits listed here. Only consider one of the orange &ldquo;maybe-traits&rdquo; if you elect to get Additional Traits later on. In fact, traits are so good for the Counter Savant, you might want to consider taking a drawback if you&rsquo;re allowed. If you are allowed and are so inclined, take something like Betrayed that gives a penalty to a stat you don&rsquo;t care about. Traits are good.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c20 c5">Adopted (social)</span><span class="c3">- Basically gives you Warrior of Old or Strength of the Land at the cost of a social trait instead of a racial trait.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c5">Elven Reflexes (race)</span><span>- +2 on initiative is amazing.

Choose either </span><span class="c2">dispel magic</span><span>, or </span><span class="c2">greater dispel magic. </span><span>I recommend going with </span><span class="c2">dispel magic </span><span>if you&rsquo;re starting the campaign at levels 1-9, and </span><span class="c2">greater dispel magic </span><span class="c3">if you&rsquo;re starting at levels 10-20.

Magical Lineage? ORANGE? Yep. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, Magical Lineage is an absurdly powerful trait on just about any spellcaster that has access to metamagic. And while this build certainly can sacrifice a little for a metamagic feat or two, you have bigger fish to fry here. Any spell will work for this, but your Spell Perfection would go on one of the </span><span class="c2">dispel magic </span><span>spells anyway (a spell this trait really shouldn&rsquo;t be applied to), so you may as well choose the opposition spell you&rsquo;re going to choose to be Preferred. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c20 c5">Outlander [Lore Seeker] (campaign, RotR)</span><span>- Get a +1 CL and DC to 3 spells of your choosing, plus a +1 on Knowledge (arcana).

If you play in Rise of the Runelords, slap this baby on the two different </span><span class="c2">dispel magics</span><span>&nbsp;and any other spell you feel like (</span><span class="c2">spellcrash </span><span>could be fun).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c18 c5 c19"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c19">Scorned By Magic (magic)</span><span>- Really just seems like a worse Secret of the Impossible Kingdom since your </span><span class="c2">dispel magic </span><span class="c3">CL boost also affects targeted dispels. But i guess if you happened to choose a race that gets Spell Resistance it would be 1 higher for practically everything. That&rsquo;s fun I guess.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c20 c5">Strength of the Land (race)</span><span class="c3">- +1 to all CL checks as long as you&rsquo;re touching the ground. Sure you&rsquo;ll have to be careful about flying, but a higher CL to everything is just bonkers. You could also deliberately abuse this feat by always holding a rock. Since you&rsquo;re a smart player who&rsquo;s not playing a Dwarf, you&rsquo;ll need to have Dwarf parents and take Adopted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c20 c5">Spell Duel Prodigy</span><span class="c20">&nbsp;</span><span class="c20 c5">(regional)</span><span>- Holy hell is this trait amazing. +2 on dispel checks is the same as putting Secret of the Impossible Kingdom AND Gifted Adept on </span><span class="c2">dispel magic, </span><span>and that&#39;s just in addition to the +2 you get on Spellcraft checks to identify spells as they&rsquo;re cast. While not required, you&rsquo;d be kicking yourself if you passed this trait up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><h1 class="c4 c26" id="h.6ymmup5h0unj"><span class="c11 c5 c38 c45">Defensive Strategist (religion)</span><span class="c33">- Pretty solid option for when you can&rsquo;t win initiative. If you&rsquo;re not flat-footed in the surprise round, you still get to use your immediate action counterspells.

The cool thing here is you can switch which spells you know each day, but since they are never consumed, as long as you prepare spells from most schools of magic your counterspelling will never be limited by the number of times you prepared </span><span class="c38 c2 c43">fireball</span><span class="c3">.</span></h4><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c5">Spellbooks</span><span>-</span><span class="c25 c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">The ability to add new spells to your repertoire helps immensely with covering as many schools as possible. Your dependence on having a book with you isn&rsquo;t too much of a problem, as you have access to a plethora of ways to keep your trusty spellbook safely in your possession. Most GMs don&rsquo;t target a wizard&rsquo;s book, though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c30 c5">School Focus</span><span>-</span><span class="c35 c5">&nbsp;</span><span>The Counter Savant hinges on this level 1 School Savant archetype ability. It gives some awesome powers at the cost of very noticeable downsides. You get school abilities, and an extra spell prepared per level of that school, at the cost of having to choose two opposition schools and losing three of your early exploits. Th</span><span>e opposition schools aren&rsquo;t </span><span class="c2">too </span><span>much of a problem, as later discussed in the Opposition Schools section, but the loss of exploits</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;can feel like a lot. Especially considering that you can&rsquo;t take Extra Exploits until you acquire the class ability at 5th level. As far as the positives, the Counterspelling subschool is the reason the Counter Savant chooses this archetype. While abjuration isn&rsquo;t necessarily the best school to get an extra spell of per day from, the 6th level Counterspell Mastery power makes it all worth it. Plus, you can usually find at least something in Abjuration that you can reliably count on preparing each day. Having an extra spell prepared makes it all the more easier to have as many schools of magic represented, though again, Abjuration isn&rsquo;t usually the school you&rsquo;re going to be countering very often.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c20 c5">Cantrips</span><span class="c3">- Cantrips are good.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c20 c5">Arcane Reservoir</span><span class="c3">- Your Arcanist&rsquo;s bread-and-butter ability. For the Counter Savant, these points will mostly determine how many Counterspell exploits you can use. The +1 CL/DC is nothing to be scoffed at either, allowing you extra time for your abjurations, a higher success chance on dispel checks, or a higher DC for your auxiliary spells. Just be careful you don&rsquo;t burn through these quickly, as you never want to be left high and dry on your reservoir when you really need to counter an important spell.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c19">Consume Spells</span><span>- While using spell slots to power your Reservoir is nice in theory, you don&rsquo;t want to get in the habit of needing to use this all that much. Your Charisma isn&rsquo;t going to allow for more than one or two uses anyway, and your higher level slots are all but required to be used as counter fodder for incoming spells. Still, it&rsquo;s a nice trick to have when you desperately need to fill your pool. Just don&rsquo;t expect Consume Spells to be all that impactful for you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c20 c5">Arcanist Exploits</span><span class="c3">- I&rsquo;m going over these a little later on, but for now just know that Arcanist exploits are rad as hell. These are why you chose Arcanist in the first place. It&rsquo;s a shame you don&rsquo;t get any exploits until 5th level, otherwise you could take Extra Exploit to make up for the Savant&rsquo;s early-game shortcomings. Because you&rsquo;re out three of &lsquo;em, your Counter Savant is going to be pretty tight in terms of the exploits he can take.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c19">Resistance (Abjuration School)</span><span>- A boring but nice little ability. Usually you&rsquo;re going to want to just pick fire and be done with it, but if your party has other strategies (like a lightning-happy blast sorcerer) feel free to choose whatever best suits your situation. You do get the fun addition of being able to switch resistances, so if you </span><span class="c2">know </span><span>a white dragon is in your future you can feel safe knowing those 5 points of cold resistance will save the day. (Just kidding, that&#39;s </span><span class="c2">resist energy&rsquo;s </span><span>job.)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c17 c5">Disrupti</span><span class="c5 c19">on (Counterspell Subschool)</span><span>- Melee touch attack? Rounds per every two levels duration? Bleh. Now in all actuality, should you actually manage to get this ability off, it does give a pretty handy debuff to casters. The higher level spells have a larger chance to fail, which is good because the lower level ones are easier to counter. This would be much better if you could </span><span class="c2">spectral hand </span><span>it; </span><span class="c2">longarm </span><span class="c3">just isn&rsquo;t the same. You might be able to see some success with this by using a conductive weapon, but at that point why not delay your attack until the enemy starts casting a spell?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c30 c5">Counterspell Mastery (Counterspell Subschool)</span><span>- Maybe I see too much in this ability, cause I&rsquo;m telling you to slog through two pretty forgettable abilities AND focus on Abjuration to get it. And at first glance, it doesn&rsquo;t really give you that sense of awe that a lot of the other arcane schools give. The important thing as I&rsquo;ve mentioned before is that you get more uses of </span><span class="c2">immediate action </span><span>dispels. Remember, the biggest reason counterspelling sucks is that it constantly requires you to use your standard actions with potentially no benefit. The ability to selectively and reactionarily inhibit enemy spellcasting saves both on your own action economy and daily spell pool. You probably don&rsquo;t need to counterspell a </span><span class="c2">magic missile, </span><span>but a </span><span class="c2">hold person </span><span>is a lot bigger a priority. Getting Improved Counterspell is just icing on the cake here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c30 c5">Greater Exploits</span><span class="c3">- And this is why you didn&rsquo;t go exploiter wizard. Once you hit 11th level a whole new world opens up to you. You get two incredible options perfectly suited to counterspelling that turn you from a street magician with some fancy tricks to the most potent magical duelist the world has ever known. Counter Drain and Greater Counterspell allow you even more counters per day, by not consuming higher-level slots and by replenishing the reservoir points used to activate the ability</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c20 c5">Magical Supremacy</span><span class="c3">- A truly kickass capstone for the whole three of you who will ever get to play at level 20. With your Counter Drain exploit, you&rsquo;ll be slowly accumulating reservoir points, which you can then use to &ldquo;refuel&rdquo; your lost spell levels ad nauseum. You should aim to do as much of your normal spellcasting as you can using this ability, as the points sadly don&rsquo;t actually add back a spell per day. Still though, a rockin cool trick.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h1 class="c4 c12" id="h.uclxxi9ygsu0"><span class="c10"></span></h1><h1 class="c4 c26" id="h.jyj98386mer9"><span class="c10">Opposition Schools</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Because your aim is to nullify as many harmful effects as possible, you ideally want your opposition schools to reflect spells that you can stand to allow past.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c17 c5">Abjur</span><span class="c20 c5">ation</span><span>-</span><span>&nbsp;Man, wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if you could get the counterspelling subschool without being forced to focus Abjuration? There&rsquo;s not even many Abjuration spells you&rsquo;d want to counter. If for whatever reason you find yourself making a counterspeller without Counterspell Mastery and are still forced to get opposition schools, then Abjuration is ironically one of the best choices here. So few spells on this school list present real dangers that you&rsquo;d want to always be ready for them. That said, you have to prepare </span><span class="c2">dispel magic </span><span class="c3">in two spots each day, which is still definitely worth it since you&rsquo;re (hopefully) choosing a much stronger school of magic, with a staff of it to boot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c17 c5">Conjuration</span><span class="c3">- You want to be a Counter Savant who can&rsquo;t use or defend against the most versatile school in the game? What?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c20 c5">Divination</span><span>- For most Counter Savants, Divination is going to be a given as an opposition school, as you really don&rsquo;t need to counter them. The few divination combat spells are mostly preparatory/buffs that you can just </span><span class="c2">dispel </span><span>right off your enemies anyway. Your biggest loss here is having to prepare </span><span class="c2">detect magic </span><span>in two slots instead of one</span><span class="c2">. </span><span class="c3">Good thing you get a bunch of cantrips!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c19">Enchantment</span><span class="c3">- Enchantments suck. Not getting hit by enchantments does not suck. Granted, the school tends to be pretty weak for player characters due to the large amount of mind-affecting immune targets you&rsquo;re likely to fight. But to be a Counter Savant requires you be prepared for the worst the enemy has to offer. Pick Enchantment as an opposition only if you can readily foresee lots of undead in your campaign. And even then, there is a much better option.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c20 c5">Evocation</span><span>- Evocation? Blue&hellip;? B..but&hellip; MUH BLASTS!!11!!!1! Yeah. Chill out for a second. Evocation is a pretty linear school of magic. You just pick an energy type and roll some d6. You know what counters evocation spells? Energy resistance. Put another way, you just have to acquire some sort of magical </span><span class="c2">resist</span><span>ance to</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;energy </span><span class="c3">and the biggest problem Evocation poses to you is now gone. Good thing you&rsquo;re an abjurer with no better use for a 2nd level abjuration slot. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Blast spells generally have much less punishing of effects than other schools anyway. Fail a Reflex save (very often high for most PCs) and take some damage. Fail a Will save and you&rsquo;re now out of the fight. If you really want to roll dice for blast spells, Conjuration has enough for you to work with. You&rsquo;re not equipped to deal large amounts of damage anyway, you should be focused on making sure no spell ever gets in the way of stopping your Big Stupid Fighter from continuing to do what is his job anyway.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c5">Illusion</span><span>- Illusion is the only other remotely reasonable choice here, mostly for the blast-happy indecisive sorcerer-wannabes who can&rsquo;t stomach losing their precious </span><span class="c2">fireballs</span><span>. Illusion has some great spells, but for a lot of them the way to &ldquo;counterspell&rdquo; is really to just see the opponent casting an illusion. Most illusions will probably already be cast by the time a fight begins. The spells that do threaten you are mostly annoyances like </span><span class="c2">mirror image </span><span>and </span><span class="c2">invisibility</span><span>&nbsp;with the occasional threat like </span><span class="c2">phantasmal killer. </span><span>Choosing Illusion does mean you can&rsquo;t </span><span class="c2">detect magic </span><span>as easily, which is a real loss for the Spellcraft-machine.</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;<br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c19">Necromancy</span><span>- Necromancy does two things. Make undead, and throw around nasty debuffs. The making of undead usually isn&rsquo;t an in-combat concern to you, but the threat of a </span><span class="c2">blindness-deafness </span><span>is always looming at large. You&rsquo;d only really take Necromancy as an opposition school if your character (or paladin friend) has some weird moral issue with it. Still not red because Necromancy isn&rsquo;t as great a school as some of the others, so losing it isn&rsquo;t the </span><span class="c2">worst </span><span class="c3">thing you could do.</span></p><p class="c4"><span><br></span><span class="c17 c5">Transmutation</span><span>- You want to be a Counter Savant who can&rsquo;t use or defend against the largest school in the game? What?<br></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h1 class="c4 c12" id="h.fres0am7247c"><span class="c10"></span></h1><h1 class="c4 c26" id="h.cioppo7ep94q"><span class="c10">Skills</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">For the most part, your skills are going to be up to you. You have a lot of Int so there&rsquo;s plenty of room for you to put skills in suboptimal places. For a full run-down, I suggest looking into a dedicated Arcanist or Wizard guide, these are going to be pretty much the same. I&rsquo;m only including the notable skills for the Counter Savant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c5">Acrobatics</span><span class="c3">- Definitely put points in Acrobatics. Among other things, it allows you to move around squares without threatening attacks if you need to. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c5"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c5">Fly</span><span class="c3">- There comes a point in every Pathfinder game where you&rsquo;re practically expected to enter every notable fight airborne. Don&rsquo;t be caught without aerial maneuverability.<br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c30 c5">Knowledge (arcana)</span><span>- To make a targeted dispel against a specific effect on an enemy with </span><span class="c2">dispel magic</span><span class="c3">, you must name the specific effect you wish to target. And to do that, you need to make a DC 20+spell level Knowledge (arcana) check. This means you should aim to get a +28 to Knowledge (arcana) to always be able to identify every ongoing spell effect on any given enemy. Put a rank into this skill every level.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c20 c5">Knowledge (the rest)</span><span class="c3">- You get all Knowledge skills, and your Intelligence is sky-high. Your first step should always be to put at least one rank in every Knowledge skill to allow you to make whatever checks you need. From there, focus on the most important 5 or so, and keep the others up to a healthy level every few levels. The most important 5 knowledges are (in no specific order) arcana, religion, nature, local, and planes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c20 c5">Lingui</span><span class="c5 c19">stics</span><span class="c3">- Knowing languages is great for both communicating with NPCs and for coordinating tactics. Linguistics is very much so a &ldquo;your mileage may vary&rdquo; skill, with some GMs heavily favoring racial languages, and others basically handwaving all communication to Common. Still put a few ranks here no matter what.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c18 c35 c5"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c30 c5">Spellcraft</span><span class="c3">- Every level you should be putting ranks into Spellcraft. You need to be able to identify every single spell that comes your way, to the point where your GM doesn&rsquo;t bother concealing it anymore. You need to hit a DC 24 check to successfully identify every level of spell as it gets cast (or DC 29 if you have the Ordered Mind feat). Getting a +23 to Spellcraft can reasonably happen around 10th level or so, and usually without too much effort on your behalf. You will want to put points into Spellcraft beyond that level, as it still remains an incredibly useful skill for stuff like item crafting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c5"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c5">Perception</span><span>-</span><span>&nbsp;Always a useful skill, too bad your wisdom kind of sucks. You should be putting points here about 2/3rds of the time by my estimate, just enough so you&rsquo;re usually aware </span><span>of your enemies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c20 c5">Use Magic Device</span><span class="c3">- You should have a positive Charisma, and since your spell slots are something of a precious commodity, UMD is a great way to patch up the holes in your spellcasting. A DC 20 is required to be able to activate a wand not on your spell list, so that should be your general benchmark. You know, for your own purposes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Definitely not implying some other empathically bonded entity would be benefiting from your skill ranks or anything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>...cough.<br><br></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h1 class="c4 c26" id="h.hdxdlaqsv0an"><span class="c10">Feats</span></h1><p class="c4"><span class="c3">There are a lot of feats to cover, and this guide will only touch the ones that are relevant to building a Counter Savant. There will always be exceptions and feats that aren&rsquo;t necessarily bad choices, but I highly recommend sticking to the stronger options listed below.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c20 c5">Additional</span><span class="c11 c5">&nbsp;Traits</span><span>- Depending on what traits you took and have left available, this is potentially a really strong option. If you get two +1 CL traits, then it&rsquo;s basically like a feat-tax-less Spell Specialization.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c18 c5 c19"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c19">Countering Loophole</span><span class="c3">- This feat is fun, and pretty much allows you to rebound every Enchantment spell cast at you (with only a few exceptions). The enemy still has to make their save, and this feat is locked to just charms and compulsions, but it is definitely fun when it works.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c18 c5 c19"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c19">Combat Casting</span><span>- A boring, but useful +4 to concentration. There isn&rsquo;t a caster out there that this wouldn&rsquo;t benefit. Orange just because there are so many better feats you need.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c5"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c5">Cra</span><span class="c5 c19">ft</span><span class="c25 c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c19">St</span><span class="c17 c5">aff</span><span>-</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span>As will be discussed in Equipment, a staff of </span><span class="c2">dispel magic </span><span>will benefit you incredibly. The ideal solution is to buy it or get it custom ordered for 10,800 gp, </span><span class="c17 c5">eliminating the need for this feat</span><span>. The </span><span class="c11 c5">next best solution</span><span>&nbsp;is to craft it your own if your GM allows the construction of such staves but not the purchase. This feat is </span><span class="c5 c19">nowhere near as good</span><span>&nbsp;if your GM doesn&rsquo;t allow staves that aren&rsquo;t listed in the rulebook.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c5"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c5">Craft Wondrous Item</span><span>- AKA &ldquo;Craft Everything.&rdquo; Basically gives you every magic item you&rsquo;d ever want for half price and a little bit of time. Green because it doesn&rsquo;t directly benefit you like craft staff does, but is still just so powerful on any build I can&rsquo;t not include it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c18 c5 c19"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c19">Dazing Spell</span><span>- Dazing spell is a lot of fun on any caster, but we really don&rsquo;t have too much room for it. If you can find room for it in your feats and you have a good spell candidate, it&rsquo;s certainly not a horrible choice. That said, a rod of dazing spell is ten times better.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c30 c5">Destructive Dispel</span><span>- Your level 11 or level 13 feat (If you aren&rsquo;t taking this at 11, you&rsquo;re taking Extra Exploit). Honestly one of the most powerful and reliable actions you can do in combat is targeted dispelling because of this incredible feat. At level 11 it&rsquo;s not unreasonable to assume a +8 CL to dispelling. Throw in a potential +1 DC from Spell Focu</span><span>s and your </span><span class="c2">dispel magics </span><span>have an insanely high chance to strip a buff in addition to inflicting sickness or stunning them outright. Combo with Dispel Synergy for a -2 to -4 on your next turn, potentially locking an enemy for several turns in a row. The only downside is the fortitude save, but even on a failed save your opponent is looking at a -2 to everything, including the save on your next </span><span class="c2">dispel magic.</span><span>&nbsp;Because the rules aren&rsquo;t clear on this, ask your GM if suppressing magic items on a creature counts as &ldquo;making a successful targeted dispel&rdquo; against them. If yes, this allows you to target </span><span class="c2">any </span><span>creature with </span><span class="c2">any </span><span>magical item. Lots of fun.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c18 c17 c5"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c17 c5">Dimensional Agility</span><span>- I added this feat to this list explicitly to warn you not to take it. The feat line requires you to cast a bunch of </span><span class="c2">dimension doors, </span><span class="c3">a luxury you decidedly do not have. It explicitly does not include the Dimensional Slide exploit so there&rsquo;s honestly no point here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c5"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c5">Dispel Focus</span><span>- +2 on dispel checks is nice. The cool thing about this feat is that you don&rsquo;t have to take any prerequisites like you do for Spell Specialization. The downside is that in exchange, this feat doesn&rsquo;t explicitly apply to </span><span class="c2">dispel magic </span><span>for the purposes of Spell Perfection&rsquo;s doubling effect. It&rsquo;s also kind of hard to fit in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c30 c5">Dispel Synergy</span><span>- Your level 7 or level 9 feat. Now when you targeted dispel an enemy they take a -2 to saves on your next spell in addition to stripping their effect. You&rsquo;re basically punishing any creature for having a magical buff on them. Do you know how hard it is to fight at high levels without having any magical defenses? Read any Paizo Adventure Path and tell me how many enemies past 5th level don&rsquo;t have some sort of method of magically defending themselves. This feat was made to combo with Destructive Dispel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c20 c5">Extra </span><span class="c11 c5">Exploit</span><span>- This is a very difficult feat to gauge the viability of. Technically, your build really only needs three exploits and a lot more feats than that, but you get your exploits so late it&rsquo;s hard not justifying getting this feat to ensure you get the really good exploits not strictly pertinent to this build. I can tell you for sure that taking this feat one or two times will not diminish the quality of your Counter Savant. The best time to take this feat is at 5th level, when you finally get your first exploit and are eager for more. Too bad RAW you can&rsquo;t use this to take Greater Exploits, because if you could, 11th level would be the perfect time for that. Just remember that you need feats a little bit more than exploits as there&rsquo;s fewer exploits crucial to the build. Be careful and plan in advance how you&rsquo;re going to be boosting your </span><span class="c2">dispels </span><span class="c3">while still getting the feats and exploits you need for prerequisites.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c5"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c5">Extra Reservoir</span><span class="c3">- 3 more points in arcane reservoir means 3 more uses of your Counterspell exploit. Very Solid.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c18 c5 c19"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c17 c5">Eldritch Heritage</span><span>- I know most Arcanists give Eldritch Heritage a wanton glance or two, but you&rsquo;re feat-starved as it is, your Charisma is 14 at best, </span><span class="c2">and</span><span>&nbsp;this assumes you aren&rsquo;t going for Skill Focus (Spellcraft) and instead putting it in Knowledge (arcana). The only worthwhile ability is the Familiar, and guess what? You can already get that for the cost of one exploit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c18 c5 c19"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c19">Extend Spell</span><span class="c3">- You are an abjurer after all. Extra duration on your buffs is great if you can spare the higher level slots.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c18 c5 c19"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c19">Greater Dispel Focus</span><span>- Unnecessary mostly, and takes up a precious higher-level feat. Still, +2 to dispels isn&rsquo;t bad.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c18 c17 c5"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c17 c5">Greater Spell Focus</span><span>- Ew. You do not need </span><span class="c2">another </span><span>+1 DC to your expansive list of DC-less protective spells.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c18 c17 c5"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c17 c5">Greater Spell Specialization</span><span class="c3">- AKA, &ldquo;Give me one more spell prepared of 3rd level.&rdquo; Not worth the feat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">Hei</span><span class="c5">ght</span><span class="c5">en S</span><span class="c5">pell</span><span class="c3">- I was in the process of reviewing Preferred Spell for this guide, and in doing so, unwittingly found that this feat could potentially change the way this build operates in entirety, depending heavily on the answers to some unanswered questions. As such, I had to make an entirely new section below just devoted to discussing it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>For now, all I will say is that this feat leads into Preferred Spell, which is possibly just as abusable as Heighten.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c5"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c20 c5">Improved</span><span class="c11 c5">&nbsp;Counterspell</span><span class="c3">- So assuming you aren&rsquo;t playing the Spell Savant and didn&rsquo;t get this feat for free, Improved Counterspell isn&rsquo;t actually required. Ordered Mind does almost the same thing, and is a far better choice until 15th level when you kick yourself for not having the prerequisite to Parry Spell. If you don&rsquo;t honestly expect your campaign to last that long, just take Bonded Mind instead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c20 c5">Improved Familiar</span><span>- A busted, stupid feat. There&rsquo;s tons of information out there on this feat and I&rsquo;m not really going to say too much more than that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c6"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c20 c5">Improved Initiative</span><span>- Going first is nice. +4 to go-</span><span>f</span><span class="c3">irst checks is very very nice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c18 c35 c5"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c30 c5">Parry Spell</span><span class="c3">- Your level 15 feat. This feat is simply incredible. From here on out, your combat effectiveness has functionally doubled. Everything you&rsquo;ve built for up to this point has been in preparation for Parry Spell. Who needs a crappy 3rd-level Quickened Spell when your swift action (in this case immediate action) instead entirely nullifies your opponent&rsquo;s high-level spell and casts it back at them, all without using up a 7th level spell slot? The Counter Savant certainly doesn&rsquo;t. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Unfortunately, you can only immediate action Parry counterspells with your Counterspell Mastery ability, as the counterspell exploit explicitly prohibits this feat from working. But Parry still gives you three (and after 18th, four) immediate action spells reflected. Parry also makes Readying an action twice as viable, as now you&rsquo;re actually doing something with your turn besides just stopping a single cast.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">Preferred Spell</span><span class="c3">- See Heighten Spell.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c17 c5">Retributive Summons</span><span>- So whenever you counterspell a summoning spell you get your own monsters, at the cost of burning a feat on Spell Focus (conjuration). The usefulness of this really depends on how often your GM throws summoned monsters at you. Could be fun for an exploiter to take this and Countering Loophole and start amassing a list of schools you can automatically shut down. But until we get more feats like these the option is low orange at best.</span><span class="c3"><br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c19">Scribe Scroll</span><span>- It&rsquo;s good to be prepared. While scribing scrolls isn&rsquo;t going to help you have every school of magic represented to counterspell from, it will help you once you&rsquo;ve burned through 8 spell slots in 4 turns and need to fall back on your secondhand spellbook of magical looseleaf parchments. A nice feat to have if you have room.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c18 c5 c19"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c19">Silent Spell</span><span>- Chances are you&rsquo;ll wish you had this at least once per campaign. Spontaneous metamagic is the way to go for situational metamagics like this. Does nothing for the build though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c18 c5 c19"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c19">Still Spell</span><span>- Chances are you&rsquo;ll wish you had this at least once per campaign. Spontaneous metamagic is the way to go for situational metamagics like this. Does nothing for the build though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c18 c5 c19"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c19">Skill Focus</span><span class="c3">- So you&rsquo;re either taking this for Spellcraft or Knowledge (arcana). A +3 and eventual +6 is pretty nice, especially for skills you&rsquo;ll be using nearly every encounter. The end goal is to get these two skills to the point where you never have to roll a d20 on these checks ever again. The feat is nice but you have many better options.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c18 c5 c19"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c19">Spell Focus</span><span class="c11 c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c19">(abjuration)</span><span>- The list of spells in the abjuration school that Spell Focus even applies to is small. The only notable bonuses you&rsquo;re getting are to </span><span class="c2">banishment/dismissal, greater stunning barrier, repulsion, prismatic wall/sphere, spellcrash</span><span>&nbsp;and your Destructive Dispels. Now these are pretty good spells, but SF for abjuration isn&rsquo;t nearly as helpful as it would be for almost any other school. It does however serve as the stepping stone feat for Spell Specialization and Varisian Tattoo for more </span><span class="c2">dispel magic </span><span class="c3">caster level buffs. Just keep in mind the number of feats you&rsquo;re committing to here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c18 c17 c5"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c17 c5">Spell Mastery</span><span>- While memorizing </span><span class="c2">dispel magic </span><span class="c3">would be nice, you really shouldn&rsquo;t waste a feat planning on not having your spellbook at some future point. How about you just keep the darn thing with you and save yourself the feat slot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c9"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c5">Spell Penetration</span><span>- Every caster will have to deal with SR eventually. Even though the Counter Savant mostly deals with defensive magic, it&rsquo;s still handy to be able to penetrate enemy defenses every once in awhile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c5"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c17 c5">Spell </span><span class="c11 c5">Perfection</span><span>- So unlike most casters, your Spell Perfection isn&rsquo;t your de facto 15th level feat, nor will it necessarily give that great a bonus regarding metamagic usage. This feat requires you to have three metamagic feats as a prerequisite, something that you really don&rsquo;t have room for. The only way I see you working this into your build is if you&rsquo;re a human who takes the two metamagic knowledge exploits, or if you chose Exploiter Wizard. So after you go through the effort to acquire two metamagic feats unrelated to your build (plus Heighten), what&rsquo;s the payoff? Doubling all caster level, DC, and spell penetration benefits to your </span><span class="c2">dispel magic; </span><span>which is admittedly pretty dang good. Assuming you took the correct feats for the rest of the build, you&rsquo;d basically be at the point where you&rsquo;d never need to roll a caster level check again. This feat is a very expensive 17th level option (15 for Exploiters). It&rsquo;s good once you get it, but costs an absurd amount of feats and exploits.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c44 c20 c5 c38 c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c20 c5">Spell Specialization</span><span>- If you took Spell Focus (abjuration), it&rsquo;s because you wanted Spell Specialization. Another +2 on </span><span class="c2">dispel magic </span><span>will never hurt. Plus you can switch your spell to </span><span class="c2">greater dispel magic </span><span class="c3">when you get it if you feel like that sort of decision is necessary.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c18 c5 c19"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c19">Toughness</span><span class="c3">- +1 hp per level is nice, because hp is that thing that determines if you&rsquo;re dead or not. Though ideally, you should be in the back and devoting all your resources to playing defense.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c20 c5">Ordered </span><span class="c11 c5">Mind</span><span class="c3">- Same thing as Improved Counterspell, except you can choose the same level or higher, instead of being strictly higher. At level 7 you should have at least a +15 to Spellcraft. Raising the DC by 5 in exchange for being an Improved Counterspell of a lower level is a trivial loss. I especially recommend this if you aren&rsquo;t going School Savant as it is a straight upgrade to Improved Counterspell that you&rsquo;d otherwise get for free. Still a good choice for Savants too, though it overlaps with your free Improved Counterspell and sadly doesn&rsquo;t apply to Counterspell Mastery. If you plan on taking this instead of Improved Counterspell, make sure you aren&rsquo;t ever going to reach 15th level before committing to opt out of the best feat in this entire guide.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c18 c17 c5"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c17 c5">Quicken Spell</span><span>- An awe-inspiring, game-changing spell for every caster...but you. Your swift actions will often be devoted to the counterspells you used an immediate action for&rsquo; the previous turn, and your higher level slots need to be open to allow those counterspells to happen. Buy the rod though, cause that&rsquo;s definitely worth it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c20 c5">Varisian Tattoo</span><span>- +1 CL to all abjurations is very very nice. Both of the </span><span class="c2">dispels </span><span class="c3">benefit, as well as giving every one of your defensive spells extra rounds of duration. This feat is the other reason you took Spell Focus in such a bad school.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c5">Yuelral&rsquo;s Blessing</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span>(Arcane Discovery)- A very solid discovery for wizards. Plenty of spells share the druid list with the wizard, most notably the </span><span class="c2">dispel magics. </span><span>This has the benefit of boosting up other spells beyond those you use for counterspelling as well. Not the first thing I&rsquo;d spend my feat slot on, but it&rsquo;s a strong option once the other choices have been taken up.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h1 class="c4 c12" id="h.o4dxzbiwd1ax"><span class="c10"></span></h1><h1 class="c4 c26" id="h.hn40txv4t4ex"><span class="c10">A Discussion on Heighten Spell (and Preferred Spell)</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>Heighten spell is one of those feats that everyone interprets differently, and you absolutely need to know what your GM considers it to mean before you choose it. The interpretation I think is most correct is that you are allowed to prepare a level 1 spell like </span><span class="c2">magic missile </span><span>in any slot from 2-9 that you are capable of casting, and it will act as a spell of that level in every way. If you wished to add more metamagic, the Heighten spell applies first to whatever level you want to bring the spell before you add the other metamagic. So you could Heighten </span><span class="c2">magic missile </span><span class="c3">to a 3rd level slot and then Empower it to have it act as a 3rd level spell using up a 5th level slot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>Now assuming your GM goes with this interpretation, then Heighten Spell is a very useful feat. You can put your </span><span class="c2">dispel magics </span><span>in any spell slot to increase their DCs, at the cost of a full-round casting time. However, there is perhaps a second, more powerful</span><span>&nbsp;option at your disposal. It seems to me that</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;you should theoretically be able to use lower-level spells heightened to higher slots to act as counterspell fuel when you might not otherwise have prepared a spell of the correct school at that level.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Here&rsquo;s the gist of what I&rsquo;m saying:</span></p><p class="c4"><span>Say you&rsquo;re at 8th level with low hp and targeted with an incoming </span><span class="c2">scorching ray. </span><span>You know your touch AC is bad, and being an intelligent Counter Savant, you took evocation as your opposition school. But, looking at your character sheet, you notice you happened to prepare </span><span class="c2">magic missile </span><span>as a first level slot, and an idea forms. You try something crazy. </span><span class="c5">You use your Counterspell Mastery ability and heighten your </span><span class="c5 c2">magic missile </span><span class="c5">up to a 3rd level slot to be used as your evocation school requirement.</span><span>&nbsp;If done in this way, Heighten Spell allows you to cover every school of magic no matter what you prepare, so long as one of every school is represented </span><span class="c2">somewhere </span><span class="c3">on your first level spell list.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>Now is this possible? Can you really do this? Well, I think so, but I honestly don&rsquo;t know for sure. Manipulating counterspell levels in this way does not have a specific rule precedent so again I must stress you talk with your GM after reading what I posit below. There is a good chance they might see this as an intentional misreading of the rules. And because it is a gray area and I honestly don&rsquo;t know which way is true, I&rsquo;m just opting to give you the information so you have the chance to benefit from this trick. But I t</span><span class="c3">hink after you show your GM my train of logic below he or she will side with me and allow the use of this weird ability. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>All said, </span><span class="c3">I would love to see some clarification on this interaction in the future, as I suspect this sort of shenanigan was not intended to be allowed. We&rsquo;re messing with RAW here, as I&rsquo;m not sure RAI the Improved Counterspell feat ever meant to allow for casting spells with long casting times. But until we get word of this, feel free to use it to your heart&rsquo;s content so long as the GM allows.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">So where does the problem lie?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">With Counterspell Mastery, you&rsquo;re casting a spell as an immediate action, which is modified to be Heightened, something which is supposed to take a full-round action as you are indeed a spontaneous caster. Are you allowed to boost a lower level spell with Heighten before the Counterspell Mastery feat makes casting it an immediate action?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Here&rsquo;s everything I could find on how metamagic feats and counterspelling interact:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><ol class="c15 lst-kix_h0y1nwq8o5om-0 start" start="1"><li class="c4 c7 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Spells modified by a metamagic feat use a spell slot higher than normal.</span></li><li class="c4 c7 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Spells of a higher level can counter lower-level spells with Improved Counterspell</span></li><li class="c4 c7 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">When you counterspell, the spell is very clearly stated to be &ldquo;cast.&ldquo;</span></li></ol><ol class="c15 lst-kix_h0y1nwq8o5om-1 start" start="1"><li class="c4 c36 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Improved Counterspell does not say this fact changes in any way.</span></li></ol><ol class="c15 lst-kix_h0y1nwq8o5om-0" start="4"><li class="c4 c7 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Whether or not a spell has been enhanced by a metamagic feat does not affect its vulnerability to counterspelling or its ability to counterspell another spell&rdquo; (from the Metamagic section of the CRB). </span></li><li class="c4 c7 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Spontaneous casters must use a longer casting time to cast a spell with a metamagic feat, either making it a full-round action or adding an extra full round to the casting time.</span></li><li class="c4 c7 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Spells that take a full-round action to cast take effect in the same round that you begin casting&rdquo; (from the Combat section of the CRB)</span></li><li class="c4 c7 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">No mention is made whether spells of any duration or a differing duration can be countered. The only two pieces of information on this we have are as follows:</span></li></ol><ol class="c15 lst-kix_h0y1nwq8o5om-1 start" start="1"><li class="c4 c36 li-bullet-0"><span>N</span><span>ormally the thing that prevents spontaneous casters counterspelling with metamagic is that Readied Actions cannot be full-round or longer. This would matter if we were counterspelling normally, as a Heightened spell therefore couldn&rsquo;t be readied, but we </span><span class="c2">aren&rsquo;t readying any actions</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;here. So onto 7b.</span></li><li class="c4 c36 li-bullet-0"><span>Improved Counterspell never excludes spells of a longer casting time from working as counters. From my interpretation, the way Improved Counterspell works is that you </span><span class="c2">are </span><span>able to &ldquo;cast&rdquo; spells with a longer casting time to be used as counterspells, because </span><span class="c2">otherwise it would say you cannot</span><span>. You can use </span><span class="c2">summon monster III </span><span>to counter an </span><span class="c2">acid arrow </span><span>because the wording says explicitly you can use a higher level spell of the same school, but never explicitly excludes spells like the </span><span class="c2">summon monsters </span><span class="c3">with longer casting times.</span></li></ol><ol class="c15 lst-kix_h0y1nwq8o5om-0" start="8"><li class="c4 c7 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;[Spontaneous casters] can choose when they cast their spells whether to apply their metamagic feats to improve them&rdquo; (from the Metamagic Feats section of the CRB)</span></li></ol><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Interpretation of the data</span></p><p class="c4"><span>So if it is possible under rule 7b to counterspell by &ldquo;casting&rdquo; any spell regardless of casting time, and if we assume rule 3a is correct that to counterspell involves the actual &ldquo;casting&rdquo; of a spell, then you should be able to apply a metamagic spell to a counterspell by rule 8, because in this case a spell is clearly &ldquo;cast.&rdquo; And by rule 4, the presence of Heighten does not disallow your heightened spell to successfully qualify as a suitable counter. As such it seems likely (at least in my eyes) that this </span><span class="c5">is in fact legal.</span></p><h1 class="c4 c12" id="h.ux7xgehyfode"><span class="c3"></span></h1><h1 class="c4 c26" id="h.ekqgcybl8mme"><span class="c33">Note that this problem does not exist with the Counterspell exploit, as in that instance it is explicitly mentioned that you </span><span class="c33 c2">do not cast a spell</span><span class="c33">&nbsp;to activate the effect. In this case, you simply expend the spell slot without casting it, meaning you never have a chance to Heighten. This is because of rule 8 specifying that it has to be when they </span><span class="c33 c2">cast </span><span class="c3">their spells.</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">So how good are these feats, assuming everything is legal?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c20 c5">Heighten Spell </span><span>is very good, almost to the point of being light blue. It covers up one of your biggest weaknesses, which is that you need to always have a high level spell slot prepared of the school you need to counter. It also leads into Preferred Spell, which draws from Heighten Spell and allows you to completely obliterate the need to prepare spells of one or two of your opposition schools. Additionally, you can always use the feat in the normally intended way, which, among other things, allows you to boost the DCs of your Destructive Dispels by preparing </span><span class="c2">dispel magic </span><span class="c3">as a higher level slot. The only real thing stopping Heighten from being a necessity feat is that it does mean you&rsquo;re burning through your higher level spell slots even faster than normal. Also keep in mind, this means you should never be using your daily uses of Counterspell Mastery when your Counterspell Exploit will work just fine, as Counterspell Mastery allows you to heighten lower level spells but the Exploit does not.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>If your GM disallows the Counterspell Mastery trick, </span><span class="c5 c19">Heighten Spell</span><span>&nbsp;is still a decent choice because it has some value in its normal function, and leads into Preferred Spell.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c20 c5">Preferred Spell</span><span class="c20">&nbsp;</span><span>If your GM is leery of the Heighten+Counterspell Mastery trick, you might be able to convince them that Preferred Spell works. With this feat, you can select a spell to cast spontaneously and apply a metamagic feat like Heighten without affecting the casting time. So if you took Evocation as an opposition school, selecting </span><span class="c2">magic missile </span><span>as your Preferred Spell would allow you to do the same thing as the Heighten trick, with the additional bonus of never having to specifically preparing </span><span class="c2">magic missile. </span><span>So instead of wasting two first level spells prepared trying to cover all the evocation spells, now you never have to prepare </span><span class="c2">magic missile, </span><span class="c3">but will always be able to use it. Use this on your opposition schools preferably.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>If with no convincing are you able to make the Heighten+Counterspell Mastery trick work, you can still choose </span><span class="c11 c5">Preferred spell </span><span>and select either </span><span class="c2">dispel magic </span><span>or a high-level opposition spell. Choosing </span><span class="c2">dispel magic </span><span class="c3">means you can easily Heighten as a standard action and don&rsquo;t have to prepare it, whereas a high-level spell from an opposition school means you can still at least counter lower-level spells of that school, but you can&rsquo;t change the Preferred Spell as you level up. Still really good though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>If you see that I made a mistake somewhere in this process, or have any useful information to add, I&rsquo;d love to hear it. This is certainly a very puzzling situation I&rsquo;d love clarification on.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h1 class="c4 c12" id="h.czrhoetah3t2"><span class="c10"></span></h1><h1 class="c4 c26" id="h.6jasdqmlhc8r"><span>Arcane </span><span class="c10">Exploits</span></h1><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Man, exploits are good. The Counter Savant gets just enough to make the build work, but doesn&rsquo;t get the luxury other Arcanists have where he can branch out and try a little bit of everything. Luckily Extra Exploit is there if you ever feel like you just have to have a cool toy from this list. As I have been doing, only the relevant exploits will be presented.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c19">Bloodline Development</span><span>- Decent. You&rsquo;d choose Arcane here for a bonded object so you can trade a point from your reservoir for spell of your highest level (why would you choose Familiar when you have an exploit that does it better?). Extra spells per day are pretty nice. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c18 c5 c35"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c5">Consume Magic Items</span><span>- The only reasonable way to recharge your reservoir until 11th level is by consuming magic items. All the useless scrolls and wands you pick up now have a use besides just sell-for-half fodder. For your reference, the most efficient way to consume magic items is by stockpiling 2nd-level scrolls, but remember that you&rsquo;re throwing away a 150 gp magic item each time, and that can add up fast. Green because eating up magic items is expensive, and if you only have 12 Charisma this won&rsquo;t really get you all that many points in a day, but sometimes the extra daily points are really worth it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c18 c35 c5"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c30 c5">Counterspell</span><span>- Your level 5 exploit. You&rsquo;re playing the Counter Savant, and this is the best, most reliable way to counterspell in the game, period. Note that this exploit specifically mentions the use of </span><span class="c2">dispel magic </span><span>so your bonuses to the spell should all carry over (all the literature I&rsquo;ve found on the topic seems to suggest this, anyway), or at the </span><span class="c2">very</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;least all your bonuses explicitly to dispel checks. Most of your swift actions will be devoted to this exploit. You also should aim to be spending all, if not nearly all your arcane reservoir points on this exploit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c19">Dimensional Slide</span><span class="c3">- This Exploit uses up more points than just walking, but sometimes it&rsquo;s nice to get out of a sticky situation without provoking attacks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c5">Familiar</span><span class="c3">- Extra bodies on the battlefield are great. Especially when they give you a +4 to initiative. Or when they somehow eventually turn into wand-swinging pseudodragons.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c17 c5">Face Thief</span><span class="c3">- One point wasted so you can cast a first-level spell. Yeah what a great idea.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c20 c5">Fiendish</span><span class="c5 c19">&nbsp;Proboscis</span><span>- So you can grow a long proboscis and make reach melee touch attacks to gain back reservoir points.This exploit basically is just a can of spray cheese. As-written, you can just regain reservoir points in between combats by repeatedly making attacks against yourself (or familiar) and...draining your own magical energy? I guess? I think this is a stupid violation of RAI, but RAW it theoretically should work. If your GM doesn&rsquo;t allow this, the exploit still isn&rsquo;t </span><span class="c2">terrible</span><span class="c3">, as it is still is probably the most reliable way to regain reservoir points until Counter Drain. The melee touch kind of blows, as does the inability to cast verbal spells, but at least you can attack at-range so you don&rsquo;t have to be right next to your enemy. I recommend Silent Spell and a passing Strength score if you want to take this and actually use it in combat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c19">Illusion Catcher</span><span class="c3">- Ok, so you decided to take Face Thief anyway. Well Illusion Catcher is decent I suppose. First you have to disbelieve an illusion, but once you do you get to use your absurd bonus to dispel magic to take control. It&rsquo;s neat, but I&rsquo;d really only recommend this if Illusion is one of your oppositions. That way you still have at least some way to &ldquo;counter&rdquo; illusions with disbelief saves.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c5">Item Crafting</span><span class="c3">- It&rsquo;s a free feat, and there are several really good ones you can take. Especially look into Craft Staff and Craft Wondrous.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c5">Metamagic Knowledge</span><span class="c3">- Hey look, you can get Heighten Spell for an exploit instead of a feat! Cool!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c19">Metamixing</span><span class="c3">- If your GM takes issue with the condensing of metamagic spells within immediate actions, this exploit remedies that aspect of the Heighten Spell trick. In this case, the exploit might be worth it, though it basically means your Metamagic Mastery counterspells now cost 2 points instead of 1. The ability to not change the casting time on any spell is pretty nice though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c5">Potent Magic</span><span class="c3">- Yet another way to increase your CL. Potent magic makes it even more worth it to spend a point and raise your CL (or DC) on spells or counterspells you absolutely need to land. Remember you can only spend these points on spells that you cast.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c20 c5">Quick study</span><span class="c3">- The exploit of sheer versatility. As long as you&rsquo;ve got it in your spellbook, this exploit lets you have any spell within one full-round action. Definitely more useful out-of-combat than in-combat, but there&#39;s still situations I can see you needing a specific spell and willing to wait two turns to use it. Very strong.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c19">Spell</span><span class="c11 c5">&nbsp;D</span><span class="c11 c5">isruptio</span><span class="c11 c5">n</span><span>- So basically, this allows you to spend a pool point to temporarily stop a magic effect instead of using a 3rd level spell slot to fully stop it outright. Now even the spells you decide to let through or are too strong for you to counterspell aren&rsquo;t safe. Unfortunately, if you want to do a targeted spell against an unwilling target, you need to make a melee touch attack (yuck) as opposed to the at-range in the way </span><span class="c2">dispel magic </span><span>works. Too bad it doesn&rsquo;t specify that this is a targeted dispel, otherwise Destructive Dispel would work here, but that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;d get the Greater version later on. C</span><span class="c3">onsider this if you have more than a 13 in Charisma and want to eventually take Greater Spell Disruption</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c17">Spell Tinkerer</span><span>- Kind of like Spell Disruption, but worse. Altering spell durations really isn&rsquo;t that strong, and you&rsquo;re still using a point to do what your </span><span class="c2">dispel magics </span><span class="c3">do better. Plus you actually have to be adjacent to the effect for this one, unlike Spell Disruption. Yeah, no.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Greater Exploits</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c30 c5">Counter Drain</span><span class="c3">- Oh god finally. All the way at 11th level do we finally get a reliable way to replenish our Arcane Reservoir. Counter Drain and/or Greater Counterspell should be taken at 11, while the other at 13. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c30 c5">Greater Counterspell</span><span class="c3">- Oh god finally. All the way at 11th level do we finally get to immediate action counterspell without having to waste a higher level slot. Counter Drain and/or Greater Counterspell should be taken at 11, while the other at 13. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c19">Greater Metamagic Knowledge</span><span class="c3">- Meh. It&rsquo;s a free feat, but the extra effect is kind of lame. There&rsquo;s not too many metamagic spells that work with the Counter Savant, and choosing a new one each day isn&rsquo;t really like choosing spells per day. You&rsquo;re pretty much going to have mainstay strategies by this point anyway. Take it if you have nothing else to take I suppose.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c20 c5">Greater Spell Disruption</span><span>- Cool! You now get to use a reservoir point to cast a targeted dispel instead of briefly suppressing it for a couple rounds. The Touch range blows but casting a 3rd level spell you have buffed to high hell for a reservoir point, now a renewable resource, is </span><span class="c2">awesome.</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;You also get your Charisma to the dispel check, as if you didn&rsquo;t have your checks high enough already. Basically, now you can Destructive Dispel with a touch attack and 1 reservoir point. Definitely worth wasting an exploit on Spell Disruption.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c19">Redirect Spell</span><span class="c3">- So at the cost of a point from your reservoir, you get to control enemy spells for a round instead of countering them outright. Your CL checks are sky-high, there&rsquo;s a decent number of spells this applies to, and Redirect Spell has no Exploit prerequisite, so you might as well snag this one if you&rsquo;ve got nothing else. Kind of a waste of a standard action in a lot of cases, but it might be better than dispelling it outright if an opponent&rsquo;s spell happens to work well against them. Works especially well on summoned monsters.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c5">Siphon Spell</span><span class="c3">- Gain reservoir points for using Greater Spell Disruption. This would be great if the spell you&rsquo;re siphoning didn&rsquo;t have to have an equal caster level. That said, if you exceed your dispel checks by 5 or more (ahahahaha) you get a free reservoir point, and two if it exceeds by 10. Not-so-great versus casters lower level than you, but then again, most spells they cast you&rsquo;d just counter easily anyway. Siphon Spell is the only Exploit in this build that will reward you for not having the levels on an enemy caster.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c17 c5">Spell Thief</span><span class="c3">- So this is kind of like the Redirect Spell of Spell Disruption. You steal enemy buffs and put them on yourself. Two problems with this: First, it&rsquo;s a melee touch attack. Second, you&rsquo;re not getting any of your caster level or dispel check bonuses to apply here. It&rsquo;s just a flat will save. Pass.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><h1 class="c4 c26" id="h.m339xtebzwo3"><span class="c10">Equipment</span></h1><p class="c4"><span class="c3">For the most part, what you wear is up to you as there are few items that give the bonuses we need. I&rsquo;m going to go through all the items that you&rsquo;re going to want to pay special attention to. This is by no means an exhaustive list.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Staves</span></p><p class="c4"><span>A </span><span class="c2">Staff of Dispel Magic </span><span>containing the spell at just 1 charge is so incredibly useful to the Counter Savant that it should be bought as soon as possible. This spell fuels your readied counterspelling; your destructive, synergized targeted dispels; and your permanent duration spell disruption. You also can free up your 3rd level slot for one of the other amazing abjurations at that level, like </span><span class="c2">ablative sphere, protection from energy, communal resist energy, magic circle vs. evil, </span><span>or </span><span class="c2">greater stunning barrier. </span><span>&nbsp;May the gods have mercy on your soul if your GM only allows printed staves, because the next cheapest staff with </span><span class="c2">dispel magic </span><span class="c3">is 72,000 gp more expensive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c30 c5">Staff of Dispel Magic</span><span>&nbsp;(9,600 gp)</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c5">Staff of Abjuration</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(82,000 gp)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Rods</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Really any metamagic rod you can get your hand on is going to be great. I&rsquo;m really not exaggerating here, you can definitely find a use for pretty much every metamagic rod in the game.

He makes sure all 6 schools he doesn&rsquo;t oppose are well-distributed across his spell levels so he can try and use as few higher-level slots as possible. He can Heighten his preferred </span><span class="c2">magic missile </span><span>to take care of any evocation spells he deems problematic by using one of his two uses of Metamagic Mastery.

It is focused around getting an obscene caster level check to </span><span class="c2">greater dispel magic</span><span>. Vane has been travelling for so many years he&rsquo;s forgotten just how old he actually is. He is completely attuned to his surroundings and can counterspell just about anything. During his turns, he likes to do some blasting with his evocations (truly his one most regrettable vice) to assist the party in dealing damage. Even with his Ordered Mind, Vane is able to identify every spell as it is cast without fail, and will almost always be able to have a counter. He is widely known for the incredible power behind his </span><span class="c2">greater dispel magic, </span><span class="c3">as his party members say he&rsquo;s been working on that one spell for the past six years. He has gotten so adept at it that only spells of higher caster levels can possibly give him trouble, and when he inevitably strips opponents&rsquo; defenses, they are left absolutely stunned. </span></p><p class="c21 c23"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c3">For Vane, sometimes patience is a valuable strategy. When he readies an action to counterspell, he just needs to meet the level of the spell with his Ordered Mind feat. And When he inevitably counters it successfully, he is able to send the spell back on it&rsquo;s master entirely. If forced into melee, his ability to disrupt passive spells leaves foes just as petrified, for if he merely grazes a finger on someone, they find themselves in for a stunning surprise.</span></p><p class="c21 c23"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c16">Vane Garundor</span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c3">Male Human Arcanist [school savant] 18</span></p><p class="c21"><span>LN Medium humanoid (human)</span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c5">Init</span><span>&nbsp;+4;

He must use a spell at least one level higher than the spell being countered to use this ability.</span></p><h4 class="c29" id="h.6xg66gil5gsz"><span class="c1 c16">Greater Counterspell (Su)</span></h4><p class="c21"><span>By expending 1 point from his arcane reservoir, Vane can attempt to counter a spell as it is being cast. He must identify the spell being cast as normal. If he successfully does so, he can attempt to counter the spell as an immediate action and by expending an available arcanist spell slot of the same level or higher than the level of the spell being cast. To counterspell, Vane must attempt a dispel check as if using </span><span class="c2">dispel magic</span><span class="c3">. If the spell being countered is one that he has prepared, he can instead expend an available arcanist spell slot of the same level, and he receives a +5 bonus on the dispel check. Counterspelling in this way does not trigger any feats or other abilities that normally occur when a spellcaster successfully counters a spell.</span></p><p class="c21 c23"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c1 c16">Counter Drain (Su)</span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c3">Whenever Vane successfully uses the counterspell exploit, he regains a number of points to his arcane reservoir, which is determined by the level of the spell countered. Spells of 2nd level or lower do not restore any points to his arcane reservoir. Spells of 3rd and higher restore 1 point to his arcane reservoir for every three spell levels (rounded down), to a maximum of 3 points at 9th level.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c1 c16">Spell Disruption (Su)</span></p><p class="c21"><span>Vane can temporarily disrupt a spell by expending 1 point from his arcane reservoir and succeeding at a dispel check against the spell, as </span><span class="c2">dispel magic</span><span>. This ability suppresses a spell effect for 2 &nbsp;rounds. If the spell affects multiple creatures, this ability only suppresses the spell for one creature. At the end of this duration, the spell resumes and the suppressed rounds do not count against its total duration. This ability can be used on unwilling targets, but Vane must succeed at a melee </span><span>touch attack</span><span>, and the target may attempt a </span><span>Will</span><span>&nbsp;saving throw to negate the effect. This ability has no effect on spells that are instantaneous or have a duration of permanent.</span></p><p class="c21 c23"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c1 c16">Greater Spell Disruption (Su)</span></p><p class="c4"><span>Vane can disrupt a spell effect or magic item by expending 1 point from his arcane reservoir. This acts like a targeted </span><span class="c2">dispel magic</span><span>&nbsp;with a range of </span><span>touch</span><span>. He can add his </span><span>Charisma</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;modifier to the dispel check.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c1 c16">Siphon Spell (Su)</span></p><p class="c21"><span>When Vane uses the greater spell disruption exploit, he can siphon some of the power of the targeted spell to restore his arcane reservoir. If the </span><span>caster level</span><span>&nbsp;of the spell is equal to or higher than that of Vane, and he exceeds the DC of the dispel check by 5 or more, he adds 1 point to his arcane reservoir. If he exceeds this check by 10 or more, he instead adds 2 points to his arcane reservoir. This has no effect on magic items.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><h1 class="c4 c26" id="h.b8aek1g5390"><span class="c10">Conclusion</span></h1><p class="c4"><span>So there we have it. Now you are fully equipped to building your very own Counter Savant. I hope this guide has inspired you to take up the challenge, and has proven that counterspelling isn&rsquo;t necessarily doomed to uselessness. If you liked this guide, tell me what you think! Or if you have any questions, feel free to PM me on reddit, /u/eeveerulz55 and I&rsquo;d be happy to answer them. If you think I made a mistake or left something out, I&rsquo;d be happy to edit this document.
