Crunch-wise, you&rsquo;re basically an eidolon that can&rsquo;t be dismissed. An Aegis does not get combat-oriented bonus feats and gains slightly less powerful offensive statistics (compared to, say, a Barbarian&rsquo;s rage), but it does gain far greater flexibility through its customization points - essentially evolution points, to those familiar with the Summoner. Though weaker in terms of pure damage output without high optimization, the Aegis is a useful and effective member in most parties, especially those lacking a tough melee combatant. </span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>The Aegis&rsquo; core power is its adaptability - a Fighter might have to rely on his Swim skill to cross water, but the Aegis can temporarily gain a Swim speed, underwater breathing, or even flying at later levels - all on the fly, as it were. An Aegis is approximately a </span><span class="c21"><a class="c17" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://brilliantgameologists.com/boards/index.php?topic%3D1002.0&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117679431000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0FIvidP0QdNc_MnwnCQ0pN">tier 3 class</a></span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- having a decent options in many situations, being fairly powerful in situations that appeal directly to how it has been optimized, and mostly lacking encounter-breaking, game-breaking, and world-breaking power. If you&rsquo;re fine with the power level of Alchemists, Inquisitors, and Psychic Warriors, you should be fine with the Aegis.</span></p><p class="c5 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c24"><span class="c9">The Aegis and Resources</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>One of the most intriguing parts of the aegis is that it gives you a ton of resources and then doesn&rsquo;t tell you how you have to use them. To expand on that vague statement a little, let&rsquo;s take a look at the marksman class: The marksman gains most of the same resources the aegis does, but it mostly tells you </span><span class="c19">exactly</span><span>&nbsp;how to use them: Ranged attacks. You gain psionic focus, and you gain abilities that let you expend focus to benefit ranged attacks. You gain PP, and you gain powers to spend it on to improve your ranged attacks. You gain feats...which you can use to improve your ranged attacks. It&rsquo;s very </span><span class="c19">focused</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;class design.</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>Another kind of class design entirely is the psion. The psion basically gets one pool of resources (PP/powers known), and gets told &ldquo;You can do anything you want using </span><span class="c19">this one pool of resources.</span><span class="c3">&rdquo; If the psion wants better defense, he picks up a couple defensive powers. If he wants more offense, he picks up more or better offensive powers. If he wants more utility, he picks up more utility powers.</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>On the opposite end of the spectrum from both of them is the aegis: You get tons of resources, but there&rsquo;s no central theme that tells you &ldquo;burn everything to get </span><span class="c19">this</span><span>,&rdquo; and not all of your resources are as apparent as they seem. You&rsquo;ll see these themes repeated throughout the guide, but I&rsquo;d like to highlight the resources that the aegis gains to get you thinking about how </span><span class="c19">your</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;aegis build might utilize them.</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_hq4idlrp24vu-0 start"><li class="c1 c29 li-bullet-0"><span class="c15">Psionic Focus</span><span>&nbsp;- As it has PP, the aegis has the ability to gain, maintain, and expend psionic focus. However, the aegis class has </span><span class="c19">no baseline ability to benefit from psionic focus</span><span class="c3">. There are a few customizations that interact with the psionic focus system, but the baseline class doesn&rsquo;t. This means that feats, items, racial abilities, etc. that interact with psionic focus can be better for you because they&rsquo;re not in competition with your class - they&rsquo;re on a whole other track.</span></li><li class="c1 c29 li-bullet-0"><span class="c15">Swift actions</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- Aside from summoning the astral skin astral suit form, the base aegis has no use for swift actions (except a couple immediate action customizations). Some psionic classes like the Dread (and DSP classes in general) are completely swift-action locked - if you&rsquo;re an aegis, you&rsquo;re not using this resource innately. This means that you can pick up a couple swift/immediate abilities from races/feats/etc. without giving up something from your class.</span></li><li class="c1 c29 li-bullet-0"><span class="c15">Power Points</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- The only baseline Aegis ability that uses PP is the excellent Augment Suit ability, which costs a maximum of 5 PP at 20th level. At 20th level, assuming an Int of 14 and no psionic race, an aegis will have 90 PP, or 18 fully charged uses of Augment Suit - much more than you&rsquo;ll ever use in a day. With a very minor investment of a +6 Int enhancement item and a psionic race (Wild Talent+all favored class bonus into PP), a level 20 aegis can have 142 PP/day at level 20. That&rsquo;s a huge chunk of PP to invest into customizations/items/feats/racial abilities/etc. that need it.</span></li><li class="c1 c29 li-bullet-0"><span class="c15">Feats - </span><span>The aegis is strange for a melee class in that it gets absolutely </span><span class="c19">no</span><span>&nbsp;bonus combat feats (even if some customizations can mimic them to a certain extent). That&rsquo;s usually fine, because the aegis doesn&rsquo;t really </span><span class="c19">need</span><span>&nbsp;any feats except maybe Power Attack to function, so you can play around with most of them picking up whatever you want - that is, </span><span class="c19">unless </span><span class="c3">you&rsquo;re going for a high-feat investment build like TWF or ranged, in which every feat becomes mana from heaven.</span></li><li class="c1 c29 li-bullet-0"><span class="c15">Customizations</span><span>&nbsp;- Obviously, this is the biggest draw of the class. Customizations, with Reconfigure and Augment Suit backing it up, turn the aegis into possibly the most flexible &ldquo;mundane&rdquo; class in Pathfinder. Most of the time, the identity of </span><span>your </span><span>build will be coming from customizations - except when it isn&rsquo;t, such as when you&rsquo;re just dipping aegis, and aegis is just supporting your &ldquo;main class.&rdquo;</span></li></ul><p class="c5 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c24"><span class="c15 c33">Vital Statistics</span></p><p class="c5 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_5l6u3pa584s-0 start"><li class="c1 c29 li-bullet-0"><span class="c13">d10/Full BAB</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- You&rsquo;re going to take hits pretty well and hit back frequently. Average for your role, but still mostly the best there is.</span></li><li class="c1 c29 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">4+INT skills</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- You&rsquo;re not winning any awards for &ldquo;most skilled,&rdquo; but you&rsquo;re probably going to have a decent Int modifier for your class features, so you&rsquo;ll be able to pick up most of the skills you need, and maybe a few that you want.</span></li><li class="c1 c29 li-bullet-0"><span class="c13">Good Fort and Will</span><span class="c3">&nbsp; - Fortitude- and Will-save-based effects are generally nastier than Reflex-based ones, because they often kill you outright or cause you to lose control of your character. These get even better if you pick up the Stalwart customization, which is basically Evasion for Will and Fort saves.</span></li><li class="c1 c29 li-bullet-0"><span>Int-based class features; </span><span class="c11">PP but no innate manifesting</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- PP is nice for fueling Augment Suit, as well as the Harness Shard and Power Stone Repository line of customizations. </span></li></ul><p class="c5 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c24"><span class="c9">Stats and Suggested Races</span></p><p class="c24 c7"><span class="c9"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For stats, you&rsquo;re generally optimizing Str, Con, and Int, in that order. Pump Str for damage and Con for survivability; with decent natural DR/- and easily accessible resistances, you&rsquo;ll have excellent effective health. </span></p><p class="c5 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">You&rsquo;ll probably aim for a 14 or so in Int - enough to gain some benefit from it (mostly Reconfigure), but not much more. Without excellent rolls or a generous point buy, anything over a 16 is a waste of resources that could have gone to Str or Con. </span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Cha does nothing for you (an Aberrant Aegis optimizing Intimidate has a weak desire for it; the Frightful Presence customization uses it, but you can&rsquo;t take that until 11); it&rsquo;s a dump stat for 90% of Aegii. </span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Dex is a good stat in general - giving a bonus in many situations (initiative, AC/CMD, etc.), but with Full Plate armor as a class feature, you&rsquo;re not going to get as much use out of it as you&rsquo;d think; if you&rsquo;re planning on using Astral Juggernaut regularly, you&rsquo;re not going to want more than a 12-13 in Dex. </span></p><p class="c5 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Wis is always nice for Will saves and Perception checks, but with a good Will save and few class features to take advantage of psionic focus (and, by extension, Psionic Meditation), it&rsquo;s not vital, though if you&rsquo;re picking up the Psionic Weapon line of feats or the Retaliate customization, consider a 13 in Wis. A stat weight comparison will generally look like this:</span></p><p class="c5 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c24"><span class="c13">Str</span><span>&gt;</span><span class="c13">Con</span><span>&gt;</span><span class="c2">Int</span><span>&gt;</span><span class="c11">Wis</span><span>=</span><span class="c11">Dex</span><span>&gt;</span><span class="c28">Cha</span></p><p class="c5 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some niche builds (i.e. anything but a standard bruiser) will want to stray from this slightly. The Aberrant archetype values Dex over Wis because it won&rsquo;t be wearing more than light armor. Builds using Astral Armor and Astral Skin exclusively will value Dex more. A Two-Weapon Fighting (TWF) build will require Dex to meet prerequisites, but TWF is generally a poor optimization strategy to begin with (if you&rsquo;re dedicated to a TWF Aegis, check out the Extra Arms line of customizations). For a Soulbolt/Aegis/Metaforge, you&rsquo;ll obviously be optimizing Dex at the cost of some Str and Con (as the Soulbolt is a ranged archetype for the Soulknife). </span></p><p class="c5 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>With an Aegis, you&rsquo;re primarily looking for a race that grants at least one of Str, Int, or Con and does not give a penalty to any of these three. Because you&rsquo;re a frontline fighter, Small size is generally to be avoided. Anything that neither grants a bonus nor a penalty to Str, Int, or Con is </span><span class="c11">decent</span><span>, but lacking unless it has fantastic racial features. Something that gives a penalty to Str, Int, or Con without giving back something excellent is </span><span class="c28">bad</span><span class="c3">. Niche build considerations apply.</span></p><p class="c5 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">When picking a race, bonuses to melee combat and survivability like Powerful Build and Ferocity are always nice.You can get a swim speed, climb speed and fight through class features, so don&rsquo;t overvalue these in race selection. Natural attacks that do not use your limbs (such as a Bite) are nice. PP from a psionic race ranged from decent to amazing, but not critical unless you&rsquo;re planning a very PP-heavy build around something like the Power Stone Repository line of customizations. In that case, a psionic race and putting your Favored Class bonuses into PP is basically required (see the Favored Class Bonuses section below for more information).</span></p><p class="c5 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c13">Dwarf</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(+2 Con, +2 Wis, -2 Cha; full movement in armor; bonus to saves against spells)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13">Elan</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(floating +2, bonus defenses, bonus PP)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c21"><a class="c17" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.d20pfsrd.com/psionics-unleashed/races/forgeborn&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117679445000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2zvChdiPTTQsgIqkHkhxIe">Forgeborn</a></span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(+2 Str, +2 Int, -4 Cha)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">---Two of your core stats, PLUS it&rsquo;s psionic, plus all the half construct resistances, plus natural AC, plus speed not reduced in armor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13">Human</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(floating +2, bonus feat, bonus skills)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13">Half-Giant</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(+2 Str, +2 Wis, -2 Dex, Powerful Build)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">---With a greatsword, you&rsquo;re getting +3.5 damage on a hit - how many races can give you that?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13">Half-Elf</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(floating +2; consider switching Skill Focus for Exotic Weapon Proficiency)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13">Half-Orc</span><span>&nbsp;(floating +2; can pick up Ferocity </span><span class="c21"><a class="c17" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/arg-feats/ferocious-resolve-orc-half-orc&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117679447000&amp;usg=AOvVaw37tjLXKg9HaEVJNKf2RGX7">through a feat</a></span><span class="c3">)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13">Orc</span><span>&nbsp;(+4 Str, -2 Int, -2 Wis, -2 Cha, ferocity; some fun feats like </span><span class="c21"><a class="c17" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/arg-feats/trap-wrecker-orc&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117679449000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3zdYFiOhvfeefMo7IlJarv">Trap Wrecker</a></span><span>, </span><span class="c21"><a class="c17" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/arg-feats/blood-vengance-orc-half-orc&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117679449000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2-Zj-9JdQ-kazI8baeQ6j-">Blood</a></span></p><p class="c5 c31"><span class="c21"><a class="c17" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/arg-feats/blood-vengance-orc-half-orc&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117679450000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3nv61Hg8aTiKD61a9WGacb">Vengeance</a></span><span>, </span><span class="c21"><a class="c17" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/arg-feats/tenacious-survivor-orc-half-orc&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117679450000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1G_Bm316rPC6T7OJHsGndP">Tenacious Survivor</a></span><span>, and </span><span class="c21"><a class="c17" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.d20pfsrd.com%252Ffeats%252Farg-feats%252Fbullying-blow-combat-orc%26sa%3DD%26sntz%3D1%26usg%3DAFQjCNFjwh7ciT6OBTsbHlUvqrGsU020PQ&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117679451000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1IbXKTMJxM2cqqGjNipvnI">Bullying Blow</a></span><span class="c3">)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Android</span><span>&nbsp;(+2 Int, +2 Dex, -2 Cha; multiple useful immunities and resistances, amazing fluff)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Duergar</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(Paizo) (+2 Con, +2 Wis, -4 Cha; full movement in armor; nice SLA&rsquo;s)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Duergar</span><span>&nbsp;(Psionic) (+2 Con, +2 Wis, -2 Cha; full movement in armor; bonus PP)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Hobgoblins </span><span class="c3">(+2 Con, +2 Dex)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Lashunta,</span><span>&nbsp;Male (+2 Str, +2 Int, -2 Wis)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Maenad</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(floating +2, bonus PP)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Merfolk </span><span class="c3">(+2 Dex, +2 Con, +2 Cha, +2 natural armor)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">-Make sure to take Strongtail for 15ft. bonus to base land speed.

Each of them can be dismissed as a free action - insanely useful if you&rsquo;re in the equivalent of full plate and fall into a raging river - but have different summoning times. None of them are objectively better all the time, but they do each have a niche. Your success as an Aegis will in part depend on your ability to </span></p><p class="c5 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6 c2">Astral Skin</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;-</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Formed as a swift action; provides no armor bonus, but also doesn&rsquo;t interfere with anything. Grants Speed (2) and Nimble at level one - a 4 customization point value. Grants Evasion at level 2 (1 point value) and Improved Evasion at level 12 (4 point value) for a total value of 9. Decent for quickly getting access to your customizations and exploring, not as useful in combat, but it does have a niche in that you can use it while wearing armor.</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6 c2">Astral Armor</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;- </span><span>Formed as a</span><span>&nbsp;move action</span><span class="c3">; works as masterwork chainmail at level 1, improves to breastplate at level 8. Breastplate is generally considered the best medium armor, so hooray. Gain Brawn and Improved Damage for free at first level, a 4 point value. At second level, you gain Flexible Suit for free with Astral Armor, a 1 point value (for a total of 5 points). However, medium armor and a significant amount of bonus damage is nothing to sneeze at - this will often be your go-to form for dealing damage.</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c10 c6"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6 c2">Astral Juggernaut</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;- </span><span class="c3">As it&rsquo;s formed as a full-round action, you&rsquo;ll want to shift into this form before combat begins. Works as masterwork half-plate until level 7, when it functions as masterwork full plate. You start with Fortification and Hardy at level 1 (4 point value) and add Stalwart at level 2 (a 1 point value), for a total value of 5. This is usually the best form for soaking damage.</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c10 c6"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6">Other forms - </span><span>&nbsp;The book specifically calls out the GM as able to approve other base astral suit forms. There&rsquo;s already a no armor option, a medium armor option, and a heavy armor option, so a light armor option would be the logical homebrew creation; see Bonus: Homebrew below.</span></p><p class="c24 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c24"><span class="c9">Customizations</span></p><p class="c5 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Customizations are where the true versatility of the Aegis comes to bear. They work basically like evolution points for the Summoner. I&rsquo;ve roughly categorized them into three main categories: Offense, Defense, and Utility. There is also a Special section for the Extra Arms and Harness Power Stone line of customizations (which deserve more explanation) and the archetype-specific customizations (which are not available to the vanilla Aegis). </span></p><p class="c5 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One good rules of thumb is that a customization point is worth around a feat (a concept coming from the Extra Customization feat grants an additional customization point); if you&rsquo;re getting something you cannot get through a feat or something worth at least as much as a feat, it&rsquo;s probably worth your time. If you&rsquo;re getting something worth less than a feat, there&rsquo;s probably a better option. However, remember that you can change your customization points, unlike feats - it might be better to pick it up as a customization than to waste a permanent feat slot on it.</span></p><p class="c5 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number beside each customization listed below indicates the number of customization points it costs. </span><span class="c15">An &ldquo;M&rdquo; in parentheses indicates that it can be taken multiple</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c15">times</span><span class="c3">; consult the book for exactly how many times and how frequently.</span></p><p class="c5 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>Note that just because a customization is </span><span class="c11">average</span><span>&nbsp;under normal circumstances doesn&rsquo;t mean that it&rsquo;s not incredible at times. Consider the Climb customization: Normally, having a climb speed isn&rsquo;t that great, but if you need to scale a fortress (and have no access to flight), it might be completely vital to a mission. For situational abilities like this, use reconfiguration </span><span>and</span><span>&nbsp;augment suit to get them when you need them immediately, and spend the eight hours reforming your suit when you&rsquo;ve got the time. Use your &ldquo;always useful&rdquo; customizations when you&rsquo;re walking into unknown territory. I&rsquo;ll be marking highly situational customizations by color, but also </span><span class="c15">putting an &ldquo;S&rdquo; in parentheses to indicate that they are situational</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;and may be much better when the situation demands them.</span></p><p class="c5 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c24"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c10 c6">Offense</span></p><p class="c0"><span>-</span><span class="c2">Empowered Blast</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(1, S) - Trade PP for damage on a 1:1d6 ratio when using the Energy Blast customization. With Improved Ranged Attack, you&rsquo;re doing 1d6+1d6 per five class levels+1d6 per class level - nothing to sneeze at, but not the most efficient build. If you really want to be a blaster that bad, you might just want to roll a Wilder, but this is a great trick to have up your sleeve.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>-</span><span class="c11">Energy</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Blast</span><span>&nbsp;(2, S) - By itself, this is pretty piddly, but it gets good with Empowered Blast, Improved Ranged Attack, and Improved Energy blast. By itself, it&rsquo;s only really useful for things like fighting foes you can&rsquo;t touch (i.e. incorporeal when you don&rsquo;t have a magic weapon for some reason) or for shutting down regeneration. The more you put into it, the more you&rsquo;ll get out of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>-</span><span class="c11">Hardened Strikes</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(1, S) - Basically Improved Unarmed Strike as a customization. Not for everyday use, but if your DM takes away your weapons via plot, it could be worthwhile in a pinch.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>-</span><span class="c11">Improved Energy Blast </span><span class="c3">(3, S) - Lets you hit three targets with Energy Blast under conditions similar to Energy Missile. Holding off further discussion until it&rsquo;s resolved how it interacts with Empowered Blast.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>-</span><span class="c13">Improved Ranged Attack</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(2, S) - Are you taking Ranged Attack? Take this. It&rsquo;s that simple. Scales your ranged attack up to 5d8 damage per hit at level 20, which does some goofy things to the Vital Strike line, to say the least. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span><span class="c11">Psionic Attacks</span><span>&nbsp;(1) - Before you get your first +1 weapon, this is actually </span><span class="c2">pretty decent</span><span class="c3">. After you get a +1 weapon, drop it unless you&rsquo;re using it to piece DR/Magic with your Spiked Carapace customization.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span><span class="c28">Psionic Damage</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(1) - +1 damage for a feat equivalent? Even Weapon Specialization is better than this. The one thing it&rsquo;s got going for it is that it stacks with nearly everything, so if you absolutely must have every last scrap of damage possible, you might use it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span><span class="c11">Pull</span><span>&nbsp;(1) - A free Drag-like CMB check. </span><span class="c2">Decent</span><span>&nbsp;crowd control option at early levels, but as you get higher, CMD skyrockets on monsters pulled out of the Bestiary. Without the ability to take Improved/Greater feats to boost your CMB, this gets </span><span class="c28">nearly useless</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;against large foes at high levels, though it still does have some effect on lower BAB humanoids defined by their class levels.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span><span class="c11">Push</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(1) - As above, but a Bull-Rush-like CMB effect.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>-</span><span class="c2">Ranged Attack</span><span>&nbsp;(1, S) - It&rsquo;s generally not going to be your primary form of attack, but if you&rsquo;re caught without a ranged weapon, it&rsquo;s better than nothing. Note that it received errata that allows it to be used as part of a full attack - that&rsquo;s nice enough for a ranged aegis, but remember that a melee aegis can use the first couple attacks in his full attack action to bring down a melee-range foe, </span><span class="c19">then dump the rest of his attacks shooting at foes out of his reach</span><span class="c3">. Not a complete game-changer, but hey, it&rsquo;s free damage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span><span class="c2">Retaliate</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(1) - Great little customization; one of the few uses the Aegis gets for psionic focus. It doesn&rsquo;t come until level 8, but it&rsquo;s still useful then.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c11">-Spiked Carapace </span><span class="c3">(1) - Not bad for a reach build, but since you can pick up Reach as a customization, possible not as necessary.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span><span class="c2">Augmented Weapon </span><span class="c3">(2) - Nice little damage boost if you&rsquo;re using something like a Greatsword that&rsquo;s getting a 1d6 damage increase from it; great if you&rsquo;re picking up the Vital Strike chain, as it&rsquo;s based off of weapon damage dice. You&rsquo;re generally going to want to switch it out for Increased Size when you hit 9, but until then if you want maximum damage, it&rsquo;s probably Powerful Build+Increased Damage+Augmented Weapon+Crystallized Weapon for a maximum damage build.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span><span class="c28">Bra</span><span class="c13">wn</span><span>&nbsp;(2, M) - Enhancement bonus to Str. If you&rsquo;ve got an enhancement bonus to Str equal from an item equal to or greater than the amount you can give yourself through customizations, this is </span><span class="c28">worthless</span><span>. If you don&rsquo;t, this is </span><span class="c13">perfect</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;for a Str-based melee build. The advancement from this is generally faster than what you would normally get from WBL until mid levels.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span><span class="c13">Crystallized Weapon</span><span>&nbsp;(2) - Definitely take this</span><span>&nbsp;if you don&rsquo;t have Harness Power stone or another way to use your PP. In general, this is one of the highest-damage customizations, especially if you pick a psionic race that&rsquo;s going to be providing you with more PP.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span><span class="c13">Improved Damage</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(2) - It&rsquo;s more damage. If you want to increase your damage through customization points, here it is.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span><span class="c2">Increased Size</span><span>&nbsp;(2) - Great for crowd-control and Str-based damage builds. </span><span class="c11">Not as good</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;if the Wizard has been casting Enlarge Person on you from level 1, but this can free up actions for them in combat and can&rsquo;t be dispelled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span><span class="c13">Powerful Build</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">(2) - Become a Half-Giant for 2 customization points. Great for builds that are planning on focusing on crowd control and CMB. The best part is that it stacks with other size increases, including Improved/Increased Size.</span></p><p class="c5 c31"><span>-</span><span class="c11">Quickened Attacks</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(3) - Do you have another way to get a bonus attack each</span></p><p class="c1"><span>round (Speed weapon, spellcaster casting </span><span class="c19">haste</span><span>)? No? </span><span class="c13">Take this </span><span>(or buy them a wand of </span><span class="c19">haste</span><span>)</span><span>. Yes? </span><span class="c28">This doesn&rsquo;t stack</span><span class="c3">. This is a customization that&rsquo;s worth keeping in mind with your reconfigure ability; if you lose your +1 Big Stick of Speed, use reconfigure to get this to get your extra attack back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span><span class="c2">Ram</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(2, M, S) - Note heavily that the attack is treated as adamantine vs. objects. If you&rsquo;ve got enough time, you can head-butt your way through a stone wall or iron door.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>-</span><span class="c11">Retaliate, Improved</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(2) - They attack; they miss. You get to hit them anyway. Comes a bit late, but it&rsquo;s still worth considering if you&rsquo;ve got some CP to play with.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span><span class="c28">Frightful Presence</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(3) - Such a cool ability, but it scales of Cha, a dump stat, and is messed up by creatures with more HD than you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span><span class="c13">Reach</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(3) - Take it as soon as you can afford it. It&rsquo;s so much better than the Lunge feat, plus it stacks with size increases. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span><span class="c2">Increased Size, Improved</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(4) - You don&rsquo;t get it until late, but if you&rsquo;re here, you might as well pick it up.</span></p><p class="c5 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c24"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">Defense</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>-</span><span class="c11">Energy Resistance</span><span>&nbsp;(1, M, S) - Hard to justify walking around with this all the time, but if you know that you&rsquo;re going to be facing a specific energy type (i.e. a white dragon&rsquo;s lair where everything around it has been frozen into statues; a recurring villain who loves the </span><span class="c19">acid arrow </span><span>spell; a dungeon based in a volcano), this become </span><span class="c2">good</span><span>&nbsp;to </span><span class="c13">great</span><span class="c3">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span><span class="c11">Evasion</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(1) - If you&rsquo;ve got points for it, take it. However, your reflex save isn&rsquo;t that good to begin with (and you&rsquo;re probably not optimizing Dex), so you won&rsquo;t be making your saves too frequently.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>-</span><span class="c2">Improved Armor </span><span class="c3">(1) - It&rsquo;s bonus AC. Nothing great, but nothing bad.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>-</span><span class="c13">Stalwart</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(1) - Excellent. You&rsquo;ve got good Fort and Will saves - this makes you very hard to take down by targeting your saves.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>-</span><span class="c28">Adhesive Feet</span><span>&nbsp;(2, S) - A bonus to CMD and climb checks is OK...but you can also get flight and Powerful Build. </span><span class="c11">Situationally useful</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;if you need to climb something before you get flight, but then why wouldn&rsquo;t you just use the Climb customization?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>-</span><span class="c11">Energy Resistance, Improved</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(2, S) - See Energy Resistance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>-</span><span class="c13">Fortification</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(2, M) - Very nice. Crits kill characters; the bonus against sneak attack is just icing, for the most part.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>-</span><span class="c11">Hardy</span><span>&nbsp;(2, M) - See Brawn; if you don&rsquo;t have a +X Con item, this is </span><span class="c13">great</span><span class="c3">. Once you do, shuffle around your customization points elsewhere. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>-</span><span class="c2">Improved Damage Reduction </span><span>(2, M) - You can actually keep a pretty reasonable amount of DR with this customization - greater than half your HD; it just depends on whether you want to invest the resources in it or not.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>-</span><span class="c11">Nimble</span><span>&nbsp;(2, M) - See Brawn and Hardy. </span><span class="c13">Great</span><span>&nbsp;if you don&rsquo;t have an item of it, </span><span class="c28">worthless</span><span>&nbsp;if you do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>-</span><span class="c28">Power Resistance</span><span>&nbsp;(2, M, S) - PR/SR bites both ways; if you&rsquo;ve got allies regularly casting/manifesting friendly spells/powers on you, this is worthless. If you have no caster support, then this is </span><span class="c2">much more useful</span><span>, but you also don&rsquo;t have caster support, which is most of the time </span><span class="c28">going to end badly</span><span class="c3">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>-</span><span class="c28">Diehard</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(3) - Diehard is such a cool concept (to me, at least) but at three customization points, it&rsquo;s hard to justify it. If you find a spot for it in your build, cool, but there&rsquo;s probably something better you could have done with those points. Remember that a customization point is about equivalent to a feat...and you&rsquo;re spending three &ldquo;feats&rdquo; to get one feat. On the other hand, if you have the Rapid Augmentation feat, you could pick it up as a swift action if you realize you&rsquo;re suddenly going to need it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>-</span><span class="c11">Energy Immunity</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(4, S) - See Energy Resistance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>-</span><span class="c2">Improved Evasion</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(4) - Evasion only works when you make your save; this gives you benefits even when you don&rsquo;t. If you&rsquo;ve got room in your build, this is a great pick-up to negate some damage thrown at you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>-</span><span class="c2">Improved Stalwart</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(4) - The only thing keeping this from being blue is that you have to expend psionic focus to get the effect. Otherwise, this customization makes you almost impossible to stop using Fort/Will save-based abilities.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c24"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c10 c6">Utility</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span><span class="c11">Darkvision</span><span>&nbsp;(1, S) - If you have Darkvision from any other source, </span><span class="c28">skip this</span><span class="c3">. If your DM is a stickler about light rules and you&rsquo;re a human about to try to sneak into a Drow city...consider it, but also consider other places you might pick up Darkvision. Or, you know, a torch. It&rsquo;s better than nothing in an emergency, however. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span><span class="c28">Flexible Suit</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(1) - It&rsquo;s pretty &ldquo;meh,&rdquo; but remember that it helps with things like Acrobatics and Fly. Your Astral Skin suit form is another option that comes built-in for the class.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-</span><span class="c13">Harness Shard</span><span>&nbsp;(1, M) - If this doesn&rsquo;t look that good to you, you might want to look again at the </span><span class="c21"><a class="c17" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.d20pfsrd.com%252Fpsionics-unleashed%252Fequipment%252Fpsionic-items%252Funiversal-items%2523TOC-Shards%26sa%3DD%26sntz%3D1%26usg%3DAFQjCNGT38s03HYlfhGTzT39evQ5YsWNcA&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117679488000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2p6qaERl3o11YVsi01xS12">shards</a></span><span>. Consider this: You&rsquo;re a level 10 Aegis with Craft Wondrous Item (which you qualify for, thanks to Master Craftsman as a class feature) and 10 ranks in Use Magical Device. You can make an item that grants you a +10 competence bonus to UMD...for 500g and one PP each time you activate it. Of course, it&rsquo;s action-heavy as you have to spend a standard action to activate the shard in this way, but you can essentially double the number of ranks you have in any skill for a paltry amount of gold. This ability is obviously </span><span class="c28">worthless</span><span>&nbsp;if you don&rsquo;t have access to shards, but makes Craft Wondrous Item a serious build choice for every Aegis.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -</span><span class="c11">Speed</span><span>&nbsp;(1, M, S) - Eh. You go places faster. The big bonus is that you can still wear heavy armor while doing it, unlike most versions of this class feature.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c2">-</span><span class="c11">Swim</span><span>&nbsp;(1, S) and </span><span class="c11">Underwater Breath</span><span>&nbsp;(1, S) - Are you going to be going underwater? </span><span class="c13">Take these</span><span>. Are you not? Don&rsquo;t. A </span><span class="c2">good candidate</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;for reconfiguration/augment suit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>-</span><span class="c11">Chameleon</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(2,M, S) - You can boost your Stealth to some pretty absurd levels with this customization, but that brings up the point of why you would want to under most circumstances. Great situational use with reconfiguration/augment suit. Remember you can walk around in Astral Skin to gain some benefit of your Astral Suit without tanking your Stealth from an armor check penalty.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>-</span><span class="c11">Climb</span><span>&nbsp;(2, S) - See Swim. Shouldn&rsquo;t be a part of your main build, </span><span class="c2">great</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;to pick up situationally. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>-</span><span class="c13">Flight</span><span>&nbsp;(2, M) - Flight at level 5. Spend more customization points to increase speed and maneuverability. </span><span class="c19">Almost every Aegis should have at least two points in this from level 5 onward</span><span class="c3">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>-</span><span class="c11">Tremorsense</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(2) - Not bad, but be ready to ditch it once Blindsense and Blindsight come online.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>-</span><span class="c2">Unlock Psionics</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(2) - This is really good, but you need to invest resources in picking up wands, djores, etc. to really make it worth your while.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>-</span><span class="c2">Blindsense</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(3) - Invisible creatures can&rsquo;t sneak up on you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>-</span><span class="c11">Burrow</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(3, S) - Eh. How often are you really underground? Not much combat benefit, but there&rsquo;s some good RP opportunities for sneaking into/out of places.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>-</span><span class="c2">Blindsight</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(4) - It&rsquo;s a big investment, but also a big payoff. If your DM likes to send creatures with Greater Invisibility at you constantly, this will even the playing field immensely. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>-</span><span class="c11">Extra Passenger</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(4, S) - Turn yourself into a mini-mount. It&rsquo;s cute and fun, but it&rsquo;s not something to base a build around; definitely reconfigure/augment suit material.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c24 c46"><span class="c10 c6">Special</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11">Extra Arms</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The Extra arms line is a little strange: It can be used for utility, defense, or offense, depending on how deep you&rsquo;re planning to go with it. Extra Arms, Lesser is not a worthwhile build choice, but the other two are - potentially enough to base part of your build around them. </span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>-</span><span class="c28">Extra Arms, Lesser</span><span>&nbsp;(1) - Retrieve items as a swift action. It&rsquo;s got uses...very minor uses. Not useful under most circumstances, except having a hand free to reload a ranged weapon. &nbsp;However, if you want to progress up the line, it&rsquo;s a </span><span class="c2">required prerequisite</span><span class="c3">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>-</span><span class="c2">Extra Arms</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(2) - The big bonus is being able to hold a shield while using a two-handed weapon. Very nice bonus to AC when used in this way - not a damage option at all. It can be worthwhile to park yourself here in the chain and enjoy the bonus to climb checks and the extra AC from your shield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>-</span><span class="c2">Extra Arms, Greater</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(3) - Dual-wield two-handed weapons; if you&rsquo;re going for this, you have to go all the way and base your build around it, picking up the TWF chain of feats. The big problem is that this doesn&rsquo;t come online until 8th level, leaving you with not much to show for your investment until then. It&rsquo;s a very niche option.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13">Harness Power Stone</span></p><p class="c1 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>First, a quick refresher on </span><span class="c21"><a class="c17" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.d20pfsrd.com/psionics-unleashed/equipment/psionic-items/power-stones&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117679496000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0Tb3rrhVyZCbLZpGsqTMqA">Power Stones</a></span><span class="c3">: Power Stones are basically psionic scrolls. This means they&rsquo;re extremely cheap (25/150/375/700g for level 1/2/3/4 power stones), but they&rsquo;re generally 1 use items restricted by Spellcraft checks, class power lists, and key ability scores, making them very limited in usefulness to the aegis. </span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The Power Stone Repository/Harness Power Stone line essentially lets you choose a few powers through power stones and manifest from them as if you had them as powers known. You can take Power Stones from </span><span class="c19">any</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;list, so you have some incredible flexibility over your powers known. </span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c10 c15 c22"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15">Talk with your GM before taking this customization</span><span class="c3">, as it requires your GM to allow you to purchase or pick up power stones as treasure. If your GM is concerned about power stones &ldquo;not fitting in&rdquo; with his campaign world, you might remind them that power stones are functionally just scrolls - if there are scrolls in the world, there should probably be power stones. As a compromise, offer to pay 1.5 times the normal cost of the power stone to acquire a &ldquo;rare&rdquo; item, or completing a quest or test of strength to find someone to manufacture/acquire them for you.</span></p><p class="c1 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Once you know for certain you&rsquo;ll be able to get power stones in-game, you first pick up the customization </span><span class="c11">Power Stone Repository</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(1), which, by itself, just lets you attach power stones=class level to your suit and gives you a bonus on UMD checks to activate them. While a +20 to UMD at level 20 when activating power stones for 500g and a customization point is nice, this is mostly just a tax on your way to the good stuff.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>With Power Stone Repository in hand, take</span><span class="c13">&nbsp;Harness Power Stone </span><span>(1, M)</span><span>. This customization lets you choose a single level 1 power stone stored in your suit and spend PP to activate it with a manifester level of 1 </span><span class="c19">without consuming it</span><span class="c3">. You can take it a second time at class level 5 to have two level 1 powers to choose from. </span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Each time you take an improved version of Harness Power Stone, you gain a bonus to your manifester level on the previous versions of it selected. Each version grants higher level powers, and each can be take twice. Aside from Power Stone Repository, you do </span><span class="c19">not</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;need to take lower-level versions to gain higher level versions.

A decent target for reconfigure/augment suit</span></p><p class="c0"><span>-</span><span class="c28">Poison</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(2) - A very small amount of Str damage, but Str damage nonetheless; in general, you&rsquo;ve got better options. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>-</span><span class="c11">Spikes</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(2) - Not a bad ranged option for the early levels.

On the other hand, </span><span class="c21"><a class="c17" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/22678943.jpg&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117679536000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3vNgufJKXutEmOMKKGYtvQ">tentacles</a></span><span>. The Aberrant Aegis is a terrifying grappler and can stack 5 natural attacks with 5 customization points - doable by level 2 with the Extra Customization Feat.

Great dip for a </span><span class="c21"><a class="c17" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/341/937/5df.png&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117679537000&amp;usg=AOvVaw14EWme3A6zeq4a_Syw_ChP">Slenderman</a></span><span class="c3">&nbsp;build - or really, any monstrous creature. For a pure-combat, kick-in-the-door campaign, the Aberrant is worth several longing glances.</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Special: You can still take the Initiator&rsquo;s Soul line of customizations as an aberrant aegis, and if Path of War material is in play, you probably should. It&rsquo;s best to stick to disciplines with natural attacks as related weapons.</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6 c2">Ectoplasmic Artisan</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- Several potentially useful class features here: Ectoplasmic Cocoon is excellent; the mini-Eidolon is a great little meat shield, even if it lacks some of the raw power of the Summoner version. Disable Device, dealing damage that ignores hardness, and ectoplasmic creation are all nice things that change how you can interact with the world around you. The major weakness is that you&rsquo;re missing out on reconfigure. If you feel you won&rsquo;t miss that flexibility, this is a very powerful archetype - almost too much for what you&rsquo;re giving up.</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6 c28">Trailblazer</span><span>&nbsp;- Major trap. Lose Reconfigure and Augment suit - two of your absolute best class features - for the weak parts of being a Ranger? Lose Use Magic Device for Survival? Not a fair trade at all for a 1-20 Aegis. It does have one saving grace: Rapid Adjustment comes at level 1, so for a one-level dip in Aegis, it&rsquo;s a minor </span><span class="c11">net gain</span><span class="c3">. For anything else, flee this archetype.</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c13 c15">Crystal Warrior</span><span>&nbsp;(UP/PsiA) - Yes, it gives &nbsp;up a few customization points, but the benefits of this archetype are generally worth what it gives up. Psicrystal Affinity+Psicrystal Containment for free is pretty great, energy blast for 1 less customization point is OK, a few free daily uses of </span><span class="c21 c19"><a class="c17" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.d20pfsrd.com/psionics-unleashed/psionic-powers/b/battlesense&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117679540000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2fG2EAYu7spB0J_lF-MRRU">battlesense</a></span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">is great, but the real benefit comes from your psicrystal being an auto-turret spewing off little lasers while you continue to get the rest of your actions.</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c10 c15 c22">Racial-Specific Archetypes (Ultimate Psionics/Psionics Augmented)</span></p><p class="c5 c7"><span class="c9"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c15 c33">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c15 c11">Annihilator</span><span class="c6 c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c15 c11">(blue)</span><span class="c6 c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c36 c38 c39">- I have to admit, the iconic aegis is one of the first things that attracted me to the class, so I love the idea of playing a blue aegis. Unfortunately, this archetype solves the issue of playing a small-sized race by dropping augment suit - one of the aegis&rsquo; most powerful class features. If you are already 100% committed to playing a Strength-base blue aegis, this isn&rsquo;t really that bad - it just might be better to play a Medium-sized class to begin with. Playable? Certainly. Optimal? Not really.</span></p><p class="c5 c7"><span class="c36 c38 c39"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c38">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c2">War Hulk (half-giant)</span><span class="c38">&nbsp;- The bad news: It gives up Augment Suit. The good news: You can throw boulders that deal 8d8+Str mod damage at level 16 </span><span class="c38 c19">before further size increases</span><span class="c36 c38 c39">. To give a little perspective, that&rsquo;s approximately equivalent to 10d6+Str mod damage. This is a fun archetype that mostly gives up flexibility for raw defensive stats like free Toughness and more DR, plus a random great ranged attack at level 12+. Aegis+half giant is already a great combo - War Hulk is mostly a matter of taste.</span></p><p class="c5 c7"><span class="c10 c26"></span></p><p class="c24"><span class="c9">Suggested Feats</span></p><p class="c5 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c15">Special Note:</span><span>&nbsp;The Aegis, being fairly feat-independent, is an excellent candidate for Variant Multiclassing (VMC), which I wrote a guide for </span><span class="c21"><a class="c17" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1adD5wYmcP5lB4JYD8D3fUBFuumMeW4CKh9ZLVMgKSDc/edit?usp%3Dsharing&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117679543000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3qM-PLR90Z25BnfVJQgjXP">here</a></span><span>. VMC trades 5 of your level up feats for the class features of a specified class. I would recommend </span><span class="c19">considering</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c15 c13">Magus</span><span>, </span><span class="c15 c13">Wizard,</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c15 c13">Paladin;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c15 c2">Rogue</span><span class="c6 c2">&nbsp;</span><span>and </span><span class="c15 c2">Barbarian </span><span class="c3">are decent, but a bit more boring.</span></p><p class="c5 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c49">Student of the Astral Suit</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- Ultimate Psionics brought us this extremely powerful new tool for the Aegis. It increases your effective aegis level for the purpose of customizations (the absolutely most important thing for the aegis) by 4, up to your hit dice. That&rsquo;s basically 4 free levels of multiclassing (or turning a 3-4 level dip into Aegis into 7-8 effective aegis levels of customizations). If you&rsquo;re a multiclass aegis, this is insane to the point of being potentially overpowered.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">Rapid Augmentation</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- I wrote this feat, so sorry if I over- (or under-) value it. The main problem with augment suit is its action economy. Aegii aren&rsquo;t as reliant on their swift actions, so this can be a great pickup if you&rsquo;ve got a decent PP pool.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">Toughened Suit</span><span>&nbsp;- Pay a PP to gain temp HP=Aegis level whenever you summon your suit. Helps with day-to-day survivability, but really shines with Quick Suit/Raging Hulk/Dual Summon (Metaforge)/astral skin to increase </span><span class="c19">round to round</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;survivability.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c11">Quick Suit</span><span>&nbsp;- Lets you summon your suit as a free action 1/round. Just OK by itself, but potentially very useful for shenanigans like sneaking up on a foe, then suddenly being in juggernaut next to them. </span><span class="c2">Best</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;when combined with Toughened Suit.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c13">Improved Initiative</span><span>/</span><span class="c2">Ready Response</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- Improved Initiative is never a bad feat. Going first=Winning. Ready Response just takes it to another level, especially because the Aegis doesn&rsquo;t innately need psionic focus for anything.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">Extra Customization </span><span class="c3">- Think very carefully before taking this one. What are you going to get out of it? Is it worth more or less than a feat?</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c11">Extra Reconfiguration </span><span class="c3">- Reconfigure is a great class feature, but you&rsquo;re probably not going to be needing it too many times per day more than you get baseline.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c13">Power Attack</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- Are you doing a melee damage build? TAKE THIS FEAT. There is no excuse for not taking this feat if you are using a weapon two-handed and trying to deal a lot of damage. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c11">Furious Focus</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- It&rsquo;s not bad, but its usefulness falls off once you start getting iteratives.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c11">Vital Strike/Improved Vital Strike/Greater Vital Strike/Devastating Strike</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- The main use of the Vital Strike chain is that you can move and still hit hard. However, you have tricks like Harness Power stone plus a power stone of hustle. If you really like the feat chain, remember to take every size-increasing customization.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">Craft Wondrous Item/Craft Magic Arms and Armor/Craft Crystalline Focus</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- You get Master Craftsman and bonuses to your Craft checks for free. These are probably the best of the item creation feats, if you want to be your party&rsquo;s crafter.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">Toughness/Open Minded</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- +1 hit point per level and plus 1 skill point per level. They&rsquo;re there if you want &lsquo;em</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c11">Psionic Meditation</span><span>&nbsp;- None of your Aegis class features require expending psionic focus. A few customizations do, as do a few feats like Psionic Weapon. </span><span class="c2">Better </span><span class="c3">for Crystal Warriors, but in general, the Aegis is probably the psionic class that benefits least from this feat.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c11">Combat Expertise</span><span>/</span><span class="c13">Improved Trip</span><span>/</span><span class="c2">Felling Smash</span><span>/</span><span class="c2">Psionic Trip</span><span>/</span><span class="c13">Greater Trip </span><span class="c3">- Tripping is one of the few ways to &ldquo;tank&rdquo; in Pathfinder, turning yourself into more of a disrupter than a damage dealer. You&rsquo;re probably going to have the Intelligence to pick it up.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c11">Lunge</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- Always a fun little feat, but you have ways of getting reach through customizations.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c11">Improved Critical</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- It&rsquo;s there as a damage-increasing option. Just a boring feat, in my opinion.</span></p><p class="c5"><span>Two-Weapon Fighting/Improved Two-Weapon Fighting/Greater Two-Weapon Fighting - Leaving these unrated. TWF is almost always an unoptimized choice (especially because you don&rsquo;t have the bonus feats to sink into it), but if you&rsquo;re going for a TWF build, you need these.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">Weapon Focus</span><span>/</span><span class="c11">Dazzling Display</span><span>/</span><span class="c11">Shatter Defenses</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- Weapon Focus is fine for an accuracy boost - remember, damage is accuracy, but you don&rsquo;t have the Charisma focus to really commit to an Intimidate build.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">Combat Reflexes</span><span>/</span><span class="c11">Stand Still</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- You may not have the Dexterity to justify Combat Reflexes, but if you have it, you can get reach from your customizations. Stand Still is annoying because it&rsquo;s a CMB check (and not, say, a Trip or a Grapple check), so you can&rsquo;t take any additional feats to boost it. It&rsquo;ll fall off hard at high levels.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c11">Cleave</span><span>&nbsp;- Aaalmost useful before level 6 if your DM likes to swarm you with enemies.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">Improved Drag</span><span>/</span><span class="c2">Greater Drag</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- Another battle control option. In general, drag is strictly superior to bull rush because you don&rsquo;t need to put yourself out of position to use it.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c11">Improved Unarmed Strike</span><span>/</span><span class="c2">Improved Grapple</span><span>/</span><span class="c2">Greater Grapple</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- Yet another battlefield control option. Especially good with Aberrant, as you&rsquo;ll be getting big bonuses to grapple from tentacles. Ask your DM if you can substitute Hardened Strikes for Improved Unarmed Strike, as it basically accomplishes the same thing.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">Psionic Weapon</span><span>/</span><span class="c2">Greater Psionic Weapon</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- You don&rsquo;t need psionic focus for much, so this can add a nice little touch of damage to your build.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c13">Raging Hulk</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- DR from Barbarian and Aegis stacks, both classes count for customization/rage power prereqs, and you can activate your suit whenever you enter a rage. If you&rsquo;re going Barb/Aegis, there&rsquo;s no reason not to take this. If you can rage cycle, Toughened Suit gives you incredible survivability.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c11">Psionic Body</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- Psionic Body grants you 2 HP per psionic feat you have - equal to Toughness if you dump all your level up feats into psionic feats - it only really shines if your class grants you bonus psionic feats, like the Psion or Psychic Warrior. The Crystal Warrior can take advantage of it because it gets 2 free psionic feats (3 with Wild Talent from a psionic race).</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c28">Deep Focus</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">- Psicrystal Containment without the psicrystal. Unfortunately, you don&rsquo;t want Deep Body unless you&rsquo;re a Crystal Warrior, in which case you&rsquo;re getting Psicrystal Containment for free. Sort of a Catch-22 for the aegis. If an archetype ever comes out that grants the aegis a bunch of psionic bonus feats, a reason to use psionic focus, and no psicrystal, this could become interesting</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">Barroom </span><span class="c11">Brawler </span><span>- I&rsquo;m kind of in love with this feat - don&rsquo;t know what to do with your feat? Just pick it in the moment! Of course, you&rsquo;re giving up a lot of raw power for that flexibility. With this and Rapid Augmentation, you can instantly add a lot of tricks to your combat style.</span></p><p class="c5 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c24"><span class="c9">Favored Class Bonuses</span></p><p class="c24 c7"><span class="c10 c15 c22"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c15 c33">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">I&rsquo;d like to repeat what I said earlier regarding favored class bonuses: If you&rsquo;re planning on getting a lot of use out of your PP, pick a psionic race and put your favored class bonuses into PP. Why?</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of it like this: Getting 1 HP per level is approximately equivalent to one feat (Toughness); getting 1 skill point a level is approximately equivalent to one feat (Open Minded); getting one PP per level is approximately equal to 5 feats (taking Psionic Talent 5 times: 2+3+4+5+6 = 20 PP). </span></p><p class="c5 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Is it unbalanced? Not really - most alternate uses for favored class bonuses are more efficient than a feat (i.e. 1 extra round of rage per day is equal to &#8537; of an Extra Rage feat; over the course of 20 levels, that&rsquo;s 3.333 feats); it&rsquo;s just the most optimal way to build some extra PP onto your character.</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c28">Blue</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- Add 1 to the hit points restored using astral repair; if you&rsquo;re playing a Blue Aegis, take the PP.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Dromite</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- Add +1/4 to the dromite&rsquo;s armor bonus from his astral suit; it&rsquo;s 5 AC at level 20, but you&rsquo;re also playing a dromite in a class that usually doesn&rsquo;t want to be small. If you must be a Dromite Aegis, this isn&rsquo;t bad, but question what you&rsquo;ll lose by giving up the PP.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c13">Duergar</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- Increase the astral suit&rsquo;s damage reduction by +1/4; 8 (base) + 4 (customizations) + 5 (Favored Class) = 17 DR/- at level 20. Intruiging, at the very least.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c28">Half-Giant</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- Add +1 to the aegis&rsquo;s CMD when resisting a bull rush or grapple; bull rush and grapple are not that serious of effects when you&rsquo;re full BAB with good Str. Get PP instead.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11">Ophiduan</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">- Add +1/4 to the maximum dexterity bonus of the aegis&rsquo;s astral suit; interesting, could fit a TWF build, but make sure you don&rsquo;t need the PP first.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Gnome</span><span>&nbsp;- Gain +1/2 to Damage Reduction / cold iron; a very flavorful bonus, but it becomes less useful if you get to a point where almost all enemies are coming at you with +3 weapons, but still a solid choice. Too bad Gnome Aegis has </span><span class="c28">little synergy</span><span class="c3">. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c13">Half-Elf/Human</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- Add +1/4 to the aegis&rsquo;s customization points; that&rsquo;s 5 extra customization points at level 20, or about +20% of what you&rsquo;d normally have. A very nice pickup.</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c24 c32"><span class="c9">&nbsp;Build Options</span></p><p class="c24 c7 c32"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">As a full BAB class, any full BAB class is a decent dip option for you. Be careful with all dips, as they delay your customization progression unless you take Student of the Astral Suit. If you&rsquo;re planning on playing 1-20, I suggest playing straight Aegis at least to level 4 for Augment Suit (with Aegis 12 for 3 point customizations at your fingertips). Dips are very attractive for increasing your combat potential, especially with Student of the Astral Suit, but weigh the benefits and losses: Would you rather be Aegis 4/ Class 1 with some class features and Student of the Astral Suit or Aegis 5 a possibly more important feat? </span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">A side note for DMs: The Aegis is actually a nice 1-2 level dip for NPC manifesters; free armor (usually including a stat boost), free proficiency with that armor, and a nice chunk of health, and some customizations to throw some flexibility into the build. Throwing some defensive abilities on a Psion can make it more difficult for the party to kill without increasing the chances of a TPK.</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13">-Aegis 20 </span><span>or</span><span class="c13">&nbsp;Aegis 16+Student of the Astral Suit</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">- This is a perfectly viable build; gets you access to your customizations ASAP</span></p><p class="c1 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>-</span><span class="c2">Soulknife</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- By itself, Soulknife is a decent dip for the Aegis, but it really shines when you go into the Metaforge prestige class; see below for details.</span></p><p class="c1 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>-</span><span class="c2">Fighter</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- Aegii are feat-starved at low levels; Fighter can help you get off the ground faster with a few bonus feats. Fighter 1, 2, 4, and 5 are all good cut-off points. Fighter 5 nets the ability to move unhindered in medium armor.</span></p><p class="c1 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>-</span><span class="c11">Barbarian</span><span>,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c11">Ranger</span><span>, </span><span class="c11">Paladin</span><span>&nbsp;- These classes all share something in common: If you want to be an Aegis, they&rsquo;re mediocre dips for you - nothing incredible, nothing really harmful. If you want to play Barbarian, Ranger, or Paladin, then </span><span class="c13">Aegis</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;is a fantastic dip for you. For example, Paladin 2 doesn&rsquo;t do much for the Aegis; you&rsquo;re not optimizing Cha, Smite scales off Paladin level, and your swift-action self-heal is going to be dinky. Now compare Aegis 1 for the Paladin: Summonable armor, stat boosts, a PP pool, Evasion, Stalwart, and a customization to be named later.</span></p><p class="c1 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>-</span><span class="c2">Cavalier 4/Aegis x</span><span>&nbsp;- Probably the simplest way to build a mounted Aegis. Go with the </span><span class="c21"><a class="c17" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/horse-master-combat&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117679562000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3ajKjedo5RZV-KglQ_NWv1">Horse Master</a></span><span class="c3">&nbsp;feat. Cavalier is generally a weaker class than Aegis, so I would recommend a build with the least amount of investment possible in Cavalier. You want your mount as soon as possible so that you can actually do a mounted build, so I recommend something like this from level 1: Cavalier 1/Aegis 1/Cavalier 3/Aegis X.</span></p><p class="c1 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c10 c15 c22">Path of War/Initiation (Unfinished)</span></p><p class="c5 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Path of War (</span><span class="c21"><a class="c17" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.d20pfsrd.com/path-of-war&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117679563000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3qYeZSn-lwrunDWCcBHo2l">srd</a></span><span>) (and its successor, Path of War: Expanded) is Dreamscarred Press&rsquo; Pathfinder update/redesign/reimagining of the 3.5 book </span><span class="c19">Tome of Battle</span><span class="c3">.

On the other hand, you can use these to free up customization points; for example, drop a point of weapon enhancement to free up two points that might have gone into Light Fortification. It is also only a minute to transfer the weapon enhancement, making this a faster way to get some electricity resistance when you realize you&rsquo;re about to dive into a river full of eels that are sparking suspiciously.</span></li><li class="c5 c31 c29 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Dual Summon </span><span>- Summon your weapon and armor together using the longer action of the two, or expend psionic focus for the shorter actions of the two.
