class="c9 c26 c32">Introduction</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7"><br></span><span class="c1">Before the concept of the Vigilante came into play, the Monk was the original superhero. The Core Monk could leap tall buildings (or at least short walls) in a single bound and use pseudo-mystical abilities (aka powers) derived from ki. The only problem?<br><br>She was absolutely horrible. <br><br>The Core Monk was problematic because it wasn&rsquo;t very successful in any of its goals. As a &frac34; base attack bonus character, she couldn&rsquo;t go toe-to-toe with other martials. Many of her abilities were passive defenses that were at best boring and at worst, in the case of Diamond Soul, questionably working to an active detriment. Her powers included jumping really far and a healing touch that paladins openly mocked. Abundant Step, a short range teleportation, was questionably the only &ldquo;good&rdquo; class ability. </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fortunately, Paizo noticed this and came to the rescue&hellip; many, many times. The Monk has perhaps gotten the most upgrades of any class, because she needed it. The addition of Styles into the game was clearly to aid the Monk. The Qinggong &ldquo;archetype&rdquo; was really a way to create &ldquo;Monk Talents&rdquo; which, in the Unchained Monk, became Ki Powers. One archetype after another has given a little boost after a little boost after a little boost. <br><br>This was the problem; with one lone exception, everything added was a small piece of the puzzle that did little in isolation. </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The one exception was Zen Archer. </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By replacing many of the less powerful or interesting class abilities with a total synergy towards using the bow, the Zen Archer was viewed as being a head-and-shoulders upgrade to the Monk. She was combat effective, comparatively easy to make, and her abilities were both strong and made thematic sense. </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Zen Archer is the template for the Blended Archetype. </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Blended Archetype&rdquo;, in this context, is a combination of compatible archetypes in order to create a new combination which is thematically strong and more effective than the base monk. Both sides of this are equally important: the idea behind the combination should make perfect sense, and preferably have some sort of literary or real-life inspiration which would serve as the prototypical example of the Blended Archetype. As an example, the Ki Mystic, Monk of the Lotus, and Sensei archetypes all fit together to create the sort of character one would expect would look a lot like the character of Mr. Miyagi from the Karate Kid movies. This combination becomes known as the Blended Archetype Peaceful Sensei, using Mr. Miyagi as the example. These Blended Archetypes would be PFS legal, because they are merely combinations of existing rules that have been simply placed in another context. </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This guide is not an Optimization Guide. There is no promise that any Blended Archetype will be better or worse than the Zen Archer. The goal is to be thematically strong while upgrading the Core Monk. That is, admittedly, not a very high bar to cover. </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><a id="id.dfwv5g2yd5c0"></a><p class="c30"><span class="c9 c26 c20">Creating the Blended Archetypes</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There is, unfortunately, not a strong pattern that can be followed to determine which archetypes will stack together. There is a comprehensive list as of the Occult Origins book at the end of the guide.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that in mind, there are some definite highlights among the archetypes. The goal is to replace any of the abilities that are found wanting with abilities that are stronger and fit a theme. For these purposes, Abundant Step is the only class ability that will be deemed important (though at least one archetype, Monk of the Lotus, makes a substitution that can be considered equally strong); High Jump is the closest thing to second to it. As a whole, there are two things to look for: (1) Archetypes that focus the Monk in a direction that makes her stronger, and (2) Archetypes that broaden the potential abilities of the Monk. </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c22 c26 c32">Bringing The Pure Power</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Though there are no archetypes as strong and focused as the Zen Archer, Tetori (Grappling), Sohei(General Weapon Master) and Weapon Adept(Monk Weapon Master) all do a pretty good job of making your monk more viable at their chosen combat style. Additionally, Monk of the Mantis lets you get Sneak Attack damage with your Flurry and additional effects with your Stunning Fist.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c22 c26 c32">Making a Magic Monk</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Ki Mystic, Monk of the Lotus, Serpent-Fire Adept, and Monk of the Four Winds all give your Monk more &ldquo;powers&rdquo;. Ki Mystic allows you give allies the chance to reroll failures and gain divine insight in her dreams. Monk of the Lotus allows you to remove the will of others to fight, even converting enemies into allies. The Serpent-Fire Adept uses her chakras to fly, breath mystic energy, true see, and other abilities. Finally, the Monk of the Four Winds can engulf her fists and feet with elemental fire; this both gives her another pool of power, as it doesn&rsquo;t use ki, but can be combined with the Elemental Styles (Djinni, Efreeti, Marid, and Shaitan) to give your Monk&rsquo;s entangling ice fists, fire blasts that light her opponents on fire, deafening electrical storms, or columns of staggering acid. </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c22 c26 c32">Every Monk Needs A Sensei</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Sensei archetype is one of the stronger in the game, and is a frequent building block. The Sensei assists others in a manner similar to a bard, Inspiring Courage, Competency, and Greatness. Unlike other Monks, her Wisdom guides her offense and not her Strength, leaving her fewer important attributes. She can even grant others Monk class abilities.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c22 c26 c32">How Stella Got Her Ki Back</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are very few ways to regain ki. The Hungry Ghost Monk regains ki by stealing it from others in a vampiric manner, regaining points on killing blows and critical hits. The Drunken Master gains her power from a different source - the empty end of a bottle (and not to hit someone with). </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c22 c26 c32">Every Monk is a Qinggong Monk</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No time will be wasted listing Qinggong as an archetype. Qinggong Monk is being used in a manner similar to Rogue Talents; as areas of substitution become obvious, they will be listed at the bottom. </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c34 c26 c32 c7 c42"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c22 c26 c32">And Many, Many More!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is, obviously, not a comprehensive list of archetypes that can be combined. The above merely represent commonly used puzzle pieces that fit an easy to follow theme. A more comprehensive list follows at the end of the Guide. <br><br>Finally, note that some archetypes do not stack with anything. Hellcat and Zen Archer are examples of these.</span></p><p class="c30"><span class="c7"><br></span><a id="kix.femfuoc0tt4a"></a><span class="c9 c20">Archetype Compatibilities</span><span class="c1">:</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">New Blended Archetypes can be created using the compatibility lists below. Here are the steps:</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><ol class="c24 lst-kix_j55uivsg64st-0 start" start="1"><li class="c0 c15 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Find a combination of archetypes that are compatible. If three archetypes are all on the same list, they all stack. For example, Monk of the Iron Mountain and Master of Many Styles are both in the Hungry Ghost Monk list. Hungry Ghost Monk and Master of Many Styles are both in the Monk of the Iron Mountain list. Hungry Ghost Monk and Monk of the Iron Mountain are both in the Master of Many Styles list. As such, all three stack.</span></li><li class="c0 c15 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Create a concept that fits this combination. The combination of Hungry Ghost and Master of Many Styles Monks creates the Bloody Ghost Monk. So, adding in the defensive abilities of the Monk of the Iron Mountain could make a Bloody Stone Ghost. </span></li><li class="c0 c15 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Write a short description of what the new concept would be. </span></li><li class="c0 c15 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Copy the text of the archetypes picked into a word processor. Find and replace the archetype names with your new concept. </span></li><li class="c0 c15 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Add in suggestions for Styles and Qinggong replacements. If possible, give a Feat path for Blended Archetypes that use Master of Many Styles</span></li></ol><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Credit: </span><span

Peaceful Sensei stands out as unique in bringing a set of abilities to the table on the same scale and in the same design as the Sohei, Tetori, and Zen Archer. The trio of archetypes - Ki Mystic, Monk of the Lotus, and Sensei - all provide unique abilities that synergize well.</span></p><ul class="c24 lst-kix_oryagsbco2yr-0 start"><li class="c0 c15 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Wisdom controls most to-hit attack rolls, dodge bonus to AC, size of the Ki Pool, and the DC of any Monk abilities. While this doesn&rsquo;t make the monk Single-Attribute Dependent, there is considerably more flexibility by focusing many important abilities based on the same attribute.</span></li><li class="c0 c15 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">As a result of the Wisdom focus, the Psychic Sensitivity abilities synergize incredibly well, adding limited divination and movement options.</span></li><li class="c0 c15 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Touch of Serenity offers a Will Save based shut down that is rare for a martial character. More importantly, only the Monk of the Lotus and Tranquil Guardian Paladin force shut downs over multiple rounds. The sorts of enemies that often blow off your Stunning Fist will be forced to run against Touch of Serenity.</span></li><li class="c0 c15 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">The Sensei Inspire Competence ability stacks with using Ki Mystic via Advice to increase an ally&rsquo;s skill bonus.Note that this leaves a standard action open to Aid Another as well.</span></li><li class="c0 c15 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Mystic Wisdom allows you to share ANY class feature that utilizes ki. This include Qinggong substitutions. This includes the abilities for Ki Mystic, such as the example above. This includes any of the class abilities that may have been substituted out. At 10th level, you give these abilities to all allies around you. Your no-save mind control from Monk of the Lotus can be used whenever ANY ally reduces an opponent to 0 hp. There is no Mass Truestrike spell; that is something you can do.</span></li></ul><p class="c0"><span class="c22 c26 c32"><br>Peaceful Sensei</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c7">(Ki Mystic / Monk of the Lotus / Sensei)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c7">The consummate teacher, the Peaceful Sensei prefers meditation, exploration, and non-violent methods of problem solving. She wields great power in manipulation of ki, but only the foolish question whether the old teacher still has &ldquo;it&rdquo;...</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Skills</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 445.50px; height: 296.01px;"><img alt="" src="images/image10.png" style="width: 445.50px; height: 296.01px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A peaceful sensei gains Diplomacy, Linguistics, and all Knowledge skills as class skills.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Advice (Ex)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A peaceful sensei&rsquo;s advice is identical to bardic performance (using oratory), allowing him to inspire courage at 1st level, inspire competence at 3rd level, and inspire greatness at 9th level, as a bard of the peaceful sensei&rsquo;s level, usable a total number of rounds per day equal to his level + his Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This ability replaces flurry of blows, fast movement, and improved evasion.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Touch of Serenity (Su)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At 1st level, a peaceful sensei gains Touch of Serenity as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. At 6th level, and every six levels thereafter, the duration of Touch of Serenity increases by 1 round. Each round on its turn, the target may attempt a new Will save to end the effect. This duration does not stack; only the longest remaining duration applies. </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This ability replaces stunning fist.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Insightful Strike (Ex)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At 2nd level, a peaceful sensei may use his Wisdom bonus in lieu of his Strength or Dexterity on attack rolls and combat maneuver checks with unarmed strikes or monk weapons. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This ability replaces evasion and the bonus feat gained at 2nd level.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ki Mystic (Su)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At 3rd level, a peaceful sensei gains a pool of ki points equal to his Wisdom modifier. The pool increases to 1/2 his monk level + his Wisdom modifier + 2 at level 4. If the monk has at least 1 point of ki in his ki pool, he gains a +2 bonus on all Knowledge skill checks. As a swift action, the monk can spend 1 ki point immediately before making an ability, or skill check to gain a +4 insight bonus on the check.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This ability alters ki pool and replaces still mind.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Mystic Insight (Su)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At 5th level, a peaceful sensei becomes apt at giving just the right word of advice in just the nick of time. As an immediate action, the monk can spend 2 ki points to grant an ally within 30 feet the ability to reroll a single attack roll or saving throw. The ally must be able to hear the monk to gain the reroll benefit.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This ability replaces purity of body.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Mystic Wisdom (Su)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At 6th level, a peaceful sensei may use his advice ability when spending points from his ki pool to activate a class ability (using the normal actions required for each) in order to have that ability affect one ally within 30 feet rather than the peaceful sensei himself.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At 10th level, a peaceful sensei may affect all allies within 30 feet rather than himself (spending points from his ki pool only once, not once for each target). At 10th level, a peaceful sensei may instead spend 1 point from his ki pool (as a swift action) while using advice to provide a single ally within 30 feet with evasion, fast movement, high jump, purity of body, or slow fall.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At 14th level, a peaceful sensei may spend 2 points to grant one of the abilities listed above to all allies within 30 feet, or diamond body, diamond soul, or improved evasion to a single ally within 30 feet. These abilities function at the peaceful sensei&rsquo;s level and last 1 round.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This ability replaces the bonus feats gained at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Mystic Visions (Su)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At 11th level, a peaceful sensei may receive mystic visions when he rests. These visions can come as a dream, an epiphany, or even as the voice of an old friend whispering in the monk&rsquo;s mind. The effect is similar to a divination spell with a caster level equal to the monk&rsquo;s level. The divination has no casting time; it is just part of the normal dreams or visions that occur every night. Using this ability costs 2 ki points that are removed from the next day&rsquo;s total.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This ability replaces diamond body.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Touch of Surrender (Su)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At 12th level, a peaceful sensei makes a foe into a friend with a single show of mercy. As an immediate action, when one of his melee attacks would reduce a creature to 0 or fewer hit points, the monk can spend 6 ki points to make the target of that attack surrender. When the target surrenders, it is reduced to 0 hit points, becomes disabled, and is charmed, as if the monk had cast charm monster with a caster level equal to the monk&rsquo;s level. The target does not get a saving throw against this effect. This charm lasts until its duration expires, until the monk dismisses it or uses it on another creature, or until the target is again reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, whichever happens first. The monk can only have one creature charmed with touch of surrender at a time. This is a mind-affecting charm effect. </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This ability replaces abundant step.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Mystic Prescience (Su)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At 13th level, a peaceful sensei gains a +2 insight bonus to AC and CMD.

The monk can use touch of peace once per day, and must announce his intent before making his attack roll. On a successful hit, the attack deals no damage, but the target is charmed as if the monk had cast charm monster with a caster level equal to the monk&rsquo;s level. The target does not get a saving throw against this effect. The creature is charmed for 1 day per level. If the monk or his allies attack the charmed creature, or if the monk asks or commands the charmed creature to take hostile actions, the effect ends. This is a mind-affecting charm effect. </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This ability replaces quivering palm.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Learned Master (Ex)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At 17th level, a peaceful sensei gains all Knowledge skills and the Linguistics skill as class skills.

The aura emanates out to a 20-foot radius. The monk and all allies within the aura can roll two dice when making an attack roll or a saving throw and take the better result. The aura lasts for 1 round, plus an additional round for every 2 ki points spent when the monk created the aura. The monk can dismiss the aura at any time as a free action, but the ki points for the full duration of the aura are lost.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This ability replaces empty body.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Style Suggestions</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Crane Style is conducive to the peaceful sensei. </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Qingong Substitutions</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The following Qinggong substitutions complement the peaceful sensei: </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Slow Fall: Barkskin<br>High Jump: No substitution recommended<br>Wholeness of Body:True Strike<br>Timeless Body: No substitution recommended</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Stylistic Variations</span></p><ul class="c24 lst-kix_z9top6belnxh-0 start"><li class="c0 c15 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Drunken Master for Ki Mystic: Trade out some of your buffing and dice-control abilities for considerably more ki.

He does not need to meet the prerequisites of that feat, except the Elemental Fist feat. Starting at 6th level, a bloody ghost monk can choose to instead gain a wildcard style slot. Whenever he enters one or more styles, he can spend his wildcard style slots to gain feats in those styles&rsquo; feat paths (such as Earth Child Topple) as long as he meets the prerequisites. Each time he changes styles, he can also change these wildcard style slots.<br><br>This ability replaces a monk&rsquo;s standard bonus feats.<br><br></span><span class="c7 c12">Fuse Style (Ex)</span><span class="c7"><br>At 1st level, a bloody ghost monk can fuse two of the styles he knows into a more perfect style. The bloody ghost monk can have two style feat stances active at once.

He may only have two style feat stances active at a time.<br><br>At 8th level, the bloody ghost monk can fuse three styles at once.

If the monk scores a confirmed critical hit against a living enemy or reduces a living enemy to 0 or fewer hit points, he can steal some of that creature&rsquo;s ki. This ability replenishes 1 spent ki point to the monk&rsquo;s ki pool, as long as the monk has at least 1 ki point in his pool. He cannot exceed his ki pool&rsquo;s maximum. At 11th level, each time the monk successfully steals ki, he can make an immediate saving throw against one disease he is suffering from. There is no penalty for failing this saving throw.

If the monk has at least 1 ki point in his ki pool and scores a confirmed critical hit against a living enemy or reduces a living enemy to 0 or fewer hit points, he heals a number of hit points equal to his monk level. As with steal ki, some monks believe that life funnel is an unsavory act, no better than what the undead do to the living. A monk with this ability cannot steal both ki and hit points at the same time.<br><br>This ability replaces wholeness of body.<br><br></span><span class="c7 c12">Life from a Stone (Su)</span><span class="c7"><br>At 11th level, a bloody ghost monk can steal ki or life force from any creature, not just living creatures.

The temporary hit points disappear 1 hour later. The monk can only use this ability when he has at least 1 ki point in his ki pool.

At 15th level, the monk may sacrifice his ki to cast resurrection. The monk must have at least 8 points of ki in his ki pool to use this ability. These rituals do not require material components.

When the monk does this, he is truly and utterly destroyed. A monk destroyed in this way can never come back to life, not even by way of a wish or miracle spell or by the power of a deity.

As a swift action, the monk can expend 6 ki points to gain three standard actions during his turn instead of just one. The monk can use these actions to do the following: take a melee attack action, use a skill, use an extraordinary ability, or take a move action. The monk cannot use these actions to cast spells or use spell-like abilities, and cannot combine them to take full-attack actions.

Once made, this choice cannot be changed. This spirit grants the monk a new appearance and new abilities, as well as changing or augmenting the monk&rsquo;s personality in some way. Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. The monk must abide by the alignment restrictions of the aspect. If the monk ever changes his alignment to something outside the aspect&rsquo;s alignment restrictions, he loses this ability and cannot regain it unless his alignment later changes again to match that of the aspect. </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c20">Aspect of the Carp</span><span class="c1">: The monk&rsquo;s skin becomes a coat of golden, iridescent fish scales, his neck grows gills, and his fingers become webbed.

The ki-rin is honorable, honest, and self-sacrificing&mdash;a monk must be lawful good to take on the aspect of the ki-rin.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c20">Aspect of the Monkey</span><span class="c1">: The monk&rsquo;s face becomes that of a monkey, and he grows a prehensile tail. The monk can pick up objects and make unarmed attacks with his tail (though the tail does not grant additional unarmed attacks or natural attacks). In addition, the monk gains a climb speed equal to his land speed. The monkey is a creature of whimsy and a lover of pranks&mdash;a monk of any alignment can take on the aspect of the monkey.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c20">Aspect of the Oni</span><span class="c1">: The monk&rsquo;s skin becomes pitch black, and his hair turns white, black, red, or violet. He can assume gaseous form (as the spell) as a standard action for 1 minute per day per monk level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. The oni is treacherous and deceitful, and it hungers for the pain and death of living creatures&mdash;a monk must be evil to take on the aspect of the oni.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c20">Aspect of the </span><span class="c1">Owl: The monk grows feathers, and his head becomes avian, with wide, unblinking eyes.

His eyes become catlike, with vertical pupils, and his canines enlarge. Once per hour, the monk can move at 10 times his normal land speed when he makes a charge and is treated as if he had the pounce ability. The tiger is swift, fierce, and deadly&mdash;a monk of any alignment can take on the aspect of the tiger.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This ability replaces timeless body.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Firewater Breath (Su)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At 19th level, a drunken sensei can take a drink and expel a gout of alcohol-fueled fire in a 30-foot cone. Creatures within the cone take 20d6 points of fire damage. A successful Reflex saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the monk&rsquo;s level + the monk&rsquo;s Wis modifier) halves the damage. Using this ability is a standard action that consumes 4 ki points from the monk&rsquo;s ki pool.

If the monk starts and ends his turn in the same space, he gains a +2 shield bonus to AC and CMD until the start of his next turn.

If the attacker is flanking the monk, the flanking opponent who is not attacking becomes the target of the attack. Use the same attack roll, and if the attack hits the new target, that creatures takes half damage (or full damage if the attack is completely avoided). Any associated effects from the attack (such as bleed, poison, or spell effects) apply fully even if the attack deals only half damage.

What I found was a way to make a Holy monk that becomes both more adept in battle and considerably more versatile. The Reliquarian archetype of the Occultist represents someone that researches and gets power from holy items of their deity; for a class steeped in tradition and history, this is a great theme for a monk. Plus, your pool of Mental Focus is based off of Wisdom, which limits increasing your MADness. Here are the negatives:</span></p><ul class="c24 lst-kix_595usoaj553-0 start"><li class="c5 c15 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">You delay your BAB by one.

Here are the positives:</span></p><ul class="c24 lst-kix_sg9o69t1umlu-0 start"><li class="c5 c15 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Your skill list grows considerably. It is easier to list the class skills you do NOT have: Bluff, Handle Animal, Survival, Knowledge (dungeoneering), Knowledge (Geography), Knowledge (Local), Knowledge (Nature). If you happened to take Sensei or Perfect Scholar, cut that list down to only the first three.</span></li><li class="c5 c15 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">You now gain all martial weapons. Disarm, blocking, and trip options are now available with the tonfa, sansetsukon, double chicken saber, etc..</span></li><li class="c5 c15 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">You gain a domain (see The Monk Doctor, above, for the application of Blessed Surgery).</span></li><li class="c5 c15 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">You are now a spellcaster. This is fun by itself; add Magical Knack and Craft Wondrous Item and you can begin making your own magic items!</span></li><li class="c5 c15 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Transmutation is your implement.
