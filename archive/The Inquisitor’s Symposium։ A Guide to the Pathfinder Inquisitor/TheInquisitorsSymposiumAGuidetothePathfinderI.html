Yet if you look online in forum topics about the Inquisitor, you&#39;ll see many players who think that the class is something of a walking identity crisis, at least mechanically. As a &frac34; divine caster, you can&#39;t control the battlefield or slay enemies with spells like a Wizard or Sorcerer; as a &frac34; BAB class with a d8 hit die, you can&#39;t expect to hop into combat and tank all day; as a 6 + INT skill class, you can&rsquo;t get away with zero out-of-combat contributions. You&#39;re MAD, requiring decent scores in at least four attributes</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c28">STR, DEX, CON, and WIS</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">with visible benefits to boosting the other two. You get Teamwork feats aplenty, but not the ability to share them with teammates; your spell list mirrors the &ldquo;me first&rdquo; attitude. The Inquisitor class chassis is a mysterious parcel addressed to you, the player, with no note.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c48"><span class="c28">Behind the purely mechanical questions of how to build and play Inquisitors lie broader questions about what Inquisitors</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;are:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;where they fit into the scheme of faith and religion on Golarion, and where the similarities and differences lie between Inquisitors and their other divine brethren (notably Clerics, Warpriests, and Paladins). Being a newer class in the scheme of the Pathfinder system, Inquisitors have fewer publisher-official guidelines than do Clerics or Paladins, which have existed in some iteration since Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Larger supplements like </span><span class="c6">Inner Sea Gods</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;can get us part of the way there, but the rest of our conclusions are left to extrapolation. To help us explore the mechanical and existential niche of the Inquisitor, therefore, we&#39;ll look at the class alongside three other divine classes, and in the end make some educated guesses about how Paizo sees Inquisitors as distinct from the rest of the pack. As a standard disclaimer that applies to this entire guide, I (like everyone who plays RPGs) have a limited knowledge base to draw from. Rules are complex; sometimes I misinterpret them. My understanding of Golarion&rsquo;s politics, pantheon, and history is imperfect. I may not be up to date on the latest errata. I may make mistakes! Send me an e-mail about those mistakes, and I promise to amend them as best I can while crediting you, the reader.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c48"><span class="c12">And now, cry &ldquo;Onward!&rdquo; to some general thoughts about Inquisitors:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><ol class="c44 lst-kix_8bsodnhcdngh-0 start" start="1"><li class="c17 c97 li-bullet-0"><span class="c28">As with all of the divine classes,</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;there is no such thing as a &quot;stock&quot; Inquisitor, because each Inquisitor serves a different deity;</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;even two Inquisitors worshipping the same deity might cleave to different aspects of that deity&rsquo;s aims or domain portfolio, leading to wildly divergent roleplay styles.</span></li><li class="c97 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c28">My opinion is that, whichever deity you choose, </span><span class="c19">Inquisitors are best built and roleplayed with the aims of your deity in mind.</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Although you can cheese your way into a strictly &quot;optimal&quot; Inquisitor who takes all the right feats at exactly the right times, what&rsquo;s the use of playing a divine servitor of Gozreh if you don&rsquo;t whip out your +3 </span><span class="c6">Trident of Sub-Optimal DPR</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;every once in a while? Inquisitors get plenty of tricks on their own without </span><span class="c6">any</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;investment from the player, and frankly speaking, your GM will probably thank you for not munchkining the class too much, because they&rsquo;re already capable of putting out nauseating levels of damage. As a GM myself, I advocate </span><span class="c6">strongly</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;for bonus flavor feats, the bonus skill point system introduced in Pathfinder Unchained, and other house rules that some would deride as Power Creep. However, I also insist that my PCs not optimize too heavily: compelling characters have realistic flaws and weaknesses, and it&rsquo;s a royal pain in the arse to have to accommodate one uber-gamer in the bunch when everyone else is just trying to tell a good story. Your mileage may vary! Throughout this guide, you&rsquo;ll often see traditionally sub-optimal choices marked </span><span class="c24 c19">in black.</span></li><li class="c97 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c28">Unlike Clerics and Paladins, who are bound to codes of conduct and try to embody all aspects of their deities, </span><span class="c19">Inquisitors are morally flexible, often choosing to follow only one of their deity&rsquo;s aspects, duties, or qualities.</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Perhaps you&#39;re okay with going sober for a night as an Inquisitor of Cayden Cailean if it means that you&#39;ll be able to liberate those slaves more effectively; perhaps an Inquisitor of Pharasma might work with a lesser necromancer temporarily, as long as doing so enables them to crush that powerful cult trying to turn one of their members into a lich. Morality and ethics can be hazy to an Inquisitor, as they always are when your motto is &quot;The Ends Justify the Means.&quot;</span></li></ol><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c48"><span class="c28">From the minute you decide to play an Inquisitor, it behooves you to start thinking about which &quot;corner&quot; of your deity&#39;s broader agenda you want to devote yourself to. Which tenets are you willing to give your life to uphold? Which are you willing to bend</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">or even break? Which transgressions goad you into immediate action, and which are you willing to bide your time over? More than many other classes, Inquisitors have the potential to make our mutual Pathfinder story richer through their convergence of the ideals of faith and brutal, pragmatic reality. It&#39;s your job (and your GM&#39;s job) to make that story as fascinating as possible.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c24 c35 c102 c107"></span></p><h1 class="c71" id="h.v79mztvitwxp"><span class="c24 c75 c35">&nbsp;</span></h1><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h1 class="c71 c27" id="h.cxnldcg4heus"><span class="c24 c75 c35"></span></h1><h1 class="c71" id="h.97oky42723m1"><span class="c24 c75 c35">INQ102: Survey of Divine Classes</span></h1><p class="c2"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="c62" id="h.pzch8cxfhdhd"><span>The Inquisitor vs. The Cleric</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c48"><span class="c12">Let&rsquo;s begin with pure mechanics: class structure, spell list, and domain powers. For starters, Clerics get a full 9 levels of spellcasting; although Battle Clerics exist thanks to divine casters&rsquo; lack of spell failure in armor, most Clerics will lean into the caster side of their role. Clerics also prepare their spells each day, similar to the Wizard, which means that they can react more flexibly to different situations, as long as they had a good hunch at preparation time which spells the day might call for. Domains affect Clerics more strongly than they do Inquisitors (for those unfamiliar with divine casters, Domains are thematic suites of abilities granted by deities that grant bonus spells as well as special abilities that can typically be used several times per day): one Cleric with the Nobility and Luck domains might be a powerful buffer, whereas a different cleric might go the debuffing route with the Madness or Darkness domain. Inquisitors get one Domain that grants them zero bonus spells, causing them to feel less wedded to the theme than Clerics do.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c48"><span class="c28">In contrast with the more caster-ish feel of Clerics, Inquisitors were clearly designed to feel more at home amid the chaos of battle. Their Judgment, Bane, and Solo Tactics abilities coupled with their self-buffs put their offensive capabilities far ahead of Clerics. To make up for their sheer damage output, Inquisitors are less versatile than Clerics in their spellcasting, due to their spontaneous casting mechanic</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c28">think of them like divine versions of the Bard class. As an Inquisitor player, you&#39;ll be able to cast any spell you know at any time, but that makes your choice of </span><span class="c6">which</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;spells you know that much more important: a spell has to be consistently, universally effective in order to get the nod from an Inquisitor, while Clerics can afford to mix and match niche spells as needed. Outside of combat, Inquisitors are able to conserve spell slots through their skill bonuses, and can easily take on the role of party face with minimal investment. Clerics, meanwhile, are often stuck casting spells to get results.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c48"><span class="c28">In terms of roleplay flavor, Clerics feel much more attached to the everyday goings-on of their religion: they often live and interact with other clergy members or faithful on a daily basis, and are expected to regularly perform all the rites, rituals, and duties of their office. Clerics also attempt to align themselves as closely as possible with the ideals of their deity</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">indeed, they can incur divine retribution if they don&#39;t. Inquisitors get to occupy a much more nebulous space within the overall tapestry of their faith (which suits them just fine!) leading to more heterogeneous roles and personalities. Maybe you see members of your faith every day; maybe you spend months infiltrating other religions or cults. Maybe you answer to the ecclesiastical hierarchy of your church; maybe you answer only to your own interpretation of your deity&#39;s code. Maybe you wear the symbol of your god openly on your person; maybe no one knows which god you serve until it&#39;s too late. If Clerics are the black and the white, then Inquisitors are the gray.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c48"><span class="c19">tl;dr for combat:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Clerics are good, versatile spellcasters, but will never be combat monsters without specific builds; Inquisitors are combat-effective very quickly thanks to Judgment and Bane, but have weaker, more rigid spellcasting.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c48"><span class="c19">tl;dr for out of combat:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Clerics need spells to make up for skills, and strive to embody all aspects of their deities; Inquisitors use skills well already, and pick and choose aspects of their deity to fight for, usually not subscribing part and parcel to the doctrine.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="c18" id="h.18h14dpyjjb5"><span class="c24 c58">The Inquisitor vs. The Paladin</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c48"><span class="c28">Speaking of the black and the white: Paladins. To the outside observer, Paladins seem like those Lawful Stupid guys and gals who just can&#39;t leave well enough alone; much like Clerics, however, there&#39;s a very good reason </span><span class="c6">why</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;they can&#39;t leave well enough alone: they risk having their powers and abilities stripped from them if they fall too far from the ideals of their deities. As the player of a Paladin, you care less about </span><span class="c6">whether</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;you achieved the aims of your faith than about </span><span class="c6">how</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;you achieved the aims of your faith. If a Paladin of Abadar has to lie, cheat, swindle, and extort in order to topple that corrupt judge, then she is no Paladin in the eyes of her god. The victory was no victory at all. An Inquisitor of Abadar, however, may have considerably more latitude in how to restore justice: catch the judge accepting a bribe that the Inquisitor herself arranged? Fake a religious vision to scare the judge straight? Preach to the masses until an armed mob stages a coup? Abadar is Lawful, but his Inquisitors don&#39;t necessarily need to act lawfully at all times</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c6 c55">so long as the overall agenda of law, order, and civilization is advanced.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c55">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c48"><span class="c28">Paladins&#39; reputation of being Lawful Stupid also comes from the fact that they&#39;re, well, </span><span class="c6">limited</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;by which stats they&#39;re incentivized to bump. You need good CHA for spells, smites, saves...but you also need STR, CON, and some DEX to be an adequate front-line tank. Naturally, you dump both INT and WIS to achieve good scores in the other four attributes. Now what? Your Perception is shit, and even when you notice that someone is acting suspiciously, your Sense Motive is also shit. 2 + INT skill points per level doesn&#39;t leave much breathing room in out-of-combat roles, so you&#39;ll probably pick Diplomacy and Knowledge (Religion) and call it a day. Congratulations, you&#39;re now stuck roleplaying a Golden Retriever. Inquisitors, on the other hand, feel much more flexible: Stern Gaze gives you excellent bonuses to both Intimidate and Sense Motive, and with 6 + INT skill ranks per level, a WIS focus, Perception on the class list, and your various </span><span class="c6">detect [alignment]</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;spells, the wool just can&#39;t be pulled over your eyes. You&#39;re wool-proof. Having so many of the bases covered naturally leaves Inquisitors free to specialize: do you want to be a mage hunter, a divine rogue, a social skill monster, an assassin for your deity, a tactical terrifier? The choice is entirely yours.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c48"><span class="c28">The price that the Inquisitor pays for her increased flexibility and spell levels, of course, is that they&#39;re much more up-and-down combatants than Paladins. Inquisitors require one swift action for Judgment, one swift action for Bane, possibly several standard or swift actions to self-buff, and a few move actions to get positioned for Teamwork feats before they&#39;re &quot;ramped up&quot; and ready to truly wreck face. Paladins? They don&#39;t need any wind-up time. They just run in and beat enemies to a pulp with full BAB, heavy armor, unbeatable saves, self-healing, and immunity to fear, disease, and charm effects; the only tactical decisions they have to make in the course of a combat are when and whom to Smite. Their steady strength actually turns Lawful Stupid to their advantage: they&#39;re as obvious as a fox in a hen house on the battlefield, which diverts attention away from the squishier party members</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c28">including you. In combat, Inquisitors let the Fighters and Paladins have the spotlight for a bit as they make their preparations and get their buffs rolling. Once Bane, Judgment, </span><span class="c6">wrath,</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c6">divine power</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;are in effect, any enemy of any alignment can be turned into a fine red mist within a round or two.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c48"><span class="c19">tl;dr for combat:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Paladins are steady-state tanks who don&#39;t need much help to perform in combat; Inquisitors need a period of &quot;wind-up&quot; at the start of combat, after which they excel at high levels of single-target burst damage.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c48"><span class="c19">tl;dr for out of combat:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Paladins are bound by their alignment, stat blocks, and limited skills, making Lawful Stupid and a sole focus on Diplomacy or face skills too easy to fall into; Inquisitors can solve problems laterally, both in terms of their skill set and how they&#39;re willing to employ that skill set.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="c18" id="h.rhz17fkvs566"><span class="c24 c58">The Inquisitor vs. The Warpriest</span></h2><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c48"><span class="c12">In combat, Warpriests feel like a combination of Paladins and Inquisitors. Like Paladins in that they are sturdier (thanks, heavy armor and swift-cast healing) and smashier (thanks, bonus combat feats); like Inquisitors in that their action economy is complicated (thanks, swift-cast buffs), they take a few rounds to reach their peak, and their damage is capable of spiking to sickening levels (thanks, Sacred Weapon) once they hit that peak. If we were to draw an analogy to modern military roles, Warpriests are the shock troopers, while Inquisitors are special ops; they&#39;ve got about the same damage output, but they achieve it in entirely different ways. Thanks to Warpriests&#39; ability to mimic full-BAB classes for the purpose of meeting feat prerequisites, their bonus combat feats, and their boosts to weapon damage regardless of what the weapon is, Warpriests can often go for more complex or later-blooming builds like Vital Strike, Cleave, unarmed, or thrown weapon builds that Inquisitors simply don&#39;t have the feats or early entry for. As an Inquisitor player, you will likely need to stick to the basics with your combat feats in order to come up with a fully-baked, effective build.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c48"><span class="c28">Those distinctions carry over into general adventuring, too</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">Warpriests are never subtle. They&#39;re the kind of people who won&#39;t shut up about whether you&#39;ve accepted Sithrak as your god yet or not, and might just burn your house down if you take too long to decide. Admirable wrecking balls when pointed in the right direction, but not the kinds of people you want undertaking sensitive, independent investigations. Compounding the issue is their lack of skill ranks per level, which forces them to rely on spells out of combat. Relying on a skill monkey is fine when you&#39;re with the whole group, but Warpriests would have difficulty interrogating someone, navigating through an aristocratic party, or picking out the perp with their eyes shut. The skill ranks that Inquisitors get lead to mechanical independence, which in turn leads to RP independence.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c48"><span class="c19">tl;dr for combat: </span><span class="c12">Warpriests put out egregious amounts of damage, and more closely resemble Fighters in their builds; Inquisitors stick to a few tried-and-true combat builds, while relying on buff spells, Teamwork feats, Bane, and Judgment to keep their damage output high.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c24 c19">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c48"><span class="c19">tl;dr for out of combat:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Warpriests are divine Hulks (AM SMASH) with all the subtlety that role entails; Inquisitors can operate alone or in a team, shuffling skill ranks around as needed to fill just about any role in a team&#39;s composition.</span></p><p class="c103 c9"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c24 c52">&nbsp;</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h2 class="c18 c100" id="h.x6da1du9x9bf"><span class="c24 c58"></span></h2><h2 class="c18" id="h.1y4sa65s4bcg"><span class="c24 c58">Conclusions</span></h2><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c48"><span class="c12">If we were to rank our four divine classes in various areas, they might look like this:</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Offense:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Inquisitor = Warpriest = Paladin (vs. Evil enemies) &gt; Paladin (vs. non-Evil enemies) &gt; Cleric</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Defense:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Paladin &gt; Warpriest = Cleric &gt; Inquisitor</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Spellcasting:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Cleric &gt; Inquisitor = Warpriest &gt; Paladin</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Utility:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Inquisitor &gt; Cleric &gt; Warpriest &gt; Paladin</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c48"><span class="c12">Some conclusions we can draw about the niche that Inquisitors are meant to fill:</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><ul class="c44 lst-kix_qhsb9fwmvl75-0 start"><li class="c7 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c19">Inquisitors should not try to tank.</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;You can take a hit decently enough, and you have some tools for escaping sticky situations, but you never want to leave an enemy alive long enough to retaliate if you can help it. Medium armor, d8 hit die, and no real bonus to saves (</span><span>stalwart</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;excluded) do not a tank make, so try to ensure that the deadliest targets in a combat are also the deadest, preferably before they realize they should be focusing their tender ministrations on you.</span></li><li class="c7 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c19">Inquisitors should try to get as many extra attacks as possible, within reason.</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Thanks to Judgment, Bane, and self-buffs, Inquisitors can boost themselves into full-BAB territory when attacking. Core Monks will look on you with greenest envy as you proclaim that accuracy has &ldquo;just never been an issue.&rdquo; Importantly, however, Inquisitors are </span><span class="c6">not</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;a full-BAB class: at &frac34; BAB, you qualify for BAB-gated feats slowly and your iterative attack progression is delayed. Because Inquisitors can deal an additional 2d6 damage </span><span class="c6">per attack</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;(4d6 in later levels) through Bane, you need as many extra attacks as you can reasonably get. Two-Weapon Fighting, as we&#39;ll see in the Combat Styles section, isn&#39;t a great way of achieving this goal, but buff spells like </span><span class="c6">haste</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;and feats like Rapid Shot are just the drugs to satiate our attack habit.</span></li><li class="c7 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c19">Inquisitors should use their spell slots primarily to self-buff.</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;You will never have the save DCs of full casters. Repeat that to yourself every time you sit down at your table like you&#39;re at a &frac34; Casters Anonymous meeting. Unless you invest significantly (and even with significant investment your offensive casting is likely to be mediocre) you will not be able to use debuff, blast, or save-or-suck spells reliably, ever. This limitation is a blessing in disguise, however, because it clarifies the purpose of your spellcasting: to self-buff. The Inquisitor spell list features some wonderful self-buffs that you should be positively salivating to get your hands on. </span><span class="c6">Divine power, wrath, magic circle, acute senses</span><span class="c64">&mdash;</span><span class="c28">the list goes on and on. You get some team buff spells like </span><span class="c6">bless</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;or </span><span class="c6">communal protection from energy</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;and should use them as pre-combat buffs if possible. In combat, however, your spells are for you, so don&#39;t feel bad about buffing yourself into a frothing cloud of steel and divine retribution and tearing the field apart like you were meant to.</span></li><li class="c7 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c19">Inquisitors should pick spells that are always, always useful. </span><span class="c28">It&#39;s an old precept for spontaneous casters, but a good one to remember: barring certain favored class bonuses, you will only ever know 6 spells per spell level. That&#39;s not a great variety. When you find yourself thinking about choosing a spell for your spells known on your next level-up, first ask yourself whether you&#39;d use it every day (or nearly). If your answer is &quot;no,&quot; you&#39;re not picking a good spell known</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">you&#39;re picking a good scroll or wand. Spells known should be your warhorses, your standbys, your old chestnuts. The best ones can function in and out of combat, against every enemy type, with a good effect, and preferably without a save if it affects an enemy. Tall order, yes, but those criteria really help separate the wheat from the chaff.</span></li><li class="c7 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c19">Inquisitors should leverage their skills wisely. </span><span class="c28">Monster Lore makes you great at Knowledges; where does your team have gaps in those skills? Stern Gaze makes you excellent at sniffing out lies and intimidating people; how can you turn those skills to your advantage? Some archetypes can do stealth, trapfinding, bluffing; does your party need a Rogue alternative? Inquisitors can do lots of things (and some, like Intimidate, even have uses in combat) but the responsibility of deciding exactly </span><span class="c6">what</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;your Inquisitor does lies with you.</span></li><li class="c7 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c19">Inquisitors should work toward the goals of their deity without worrying too much about their methods. </span><span class="c12">Inquisitors are the living embodiment of the famous Machiavelli quote: &quot;The ends justify the means.&quot; If you can keep your hands clean and still accomplish something, extra brownie points to you, but Inquisitors aren&#39;t afraid of getting their hands dirty, either.</span></li><li class="c7 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c19">Summing up.</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;You specialize in single-target burst damage after one or two rounds of &quot;wind-up.&quot; Through judicious use of skills, spells, class abilities, and Teamwork feats, you have a plethora of combat tricks up your sleeve, and while your access to them will be patchy at first, you&#39;ll eventually have enough coverage between them to keep you combat-effective all day long. Your 3/4 BAB progression, lack of bonus feats, middling spell DCs, and spontaneous casting don&#39;t allow many of the tricks of full martials (maneuvers; feat-heavy combat builds; oodles of iteratives) or full casters (save-or-suck spells; preparation of situational or niche spells; metamagic feats like Quickened Spell) but you&#39;ll be able to do everything at 85% where they&#39;ll be stuck doing one thing at 100% and everything else at 20%. You can be built into damn near anything, which means that you&#39;ll need to discuss the party&#39;s composition needs closely with your GM and teammates.</span></li></ul><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c24 c43"></span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c24 c43"></span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c24 c43"></span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c24 c43"></span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c24 c43"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c24 c43"></span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c24 c43"></span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c24 c43"></span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c24 c43"></span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c24 c43"></span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c24 c43"></span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c24 c43"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 480.50px; height: 373.47px;"><img alt="" src="images/image5.png" style="width: 480.50px; height: 373.47px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c122">(</span><span class="c66"><a class="c40" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.moviemaker.com/wp-content/uploads/christoph-waltz-in-inglourious-basterds_650.jpg&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117384724000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0cqx5beOxHvvLVyiPnCDzf">Image Source</a></span><span class="c28 c41 c122">)</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c28 c41 c122"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c24 c43">&ldquo;I love rumors!

Try your utmost to pick up these options.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Green</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;abilities are almost universally useful, a good pick for nearly any build.

Stay away from these.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Black </span><span class="c28">abilities are mostly for flavor.

Good, plain combat fare for the Inquisitor, yessir.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">&frac34; Casting Progression:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;You&#39;re a spontaneous divine caster, so choose your spells known wisely, remembering that you won&#39;t have the DCs to consistently hit with spells that require a save. We&#39;ll prefer self- and team buffs, and leave the offense, debuffs, and battlefield control to the full casters who do it best.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Armor Proficiencies:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;You&#39;re proficient with light armor, medium armor, and shields. I really would have preferred heavy armor be made available at the outset, as it is for the Paladin and Warpriest. The front line needs you, so many melee Inquisitors will have to come up with the proficiency through a feat or invest in a Mithral Breastplate to make do with medium armor.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Good Fortitude and Will Saves,</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c19 c37">Bad Reflex Save:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">This could be a great deal worse. The old adage goes that failed Reflex saves will hurt you, failed Fort saves will kill you, but failed Will saves will kill your entire team. That&rsquo;s not far from the truth. You can pick up feats like Lightning Reflexes if you&#39;re really worried about the Reflex save, but I prefer strong Fortitude and Will saves any day of the week.

Your list is excellent, and includes Perception, all the interaction skills, and all the relevant Knowledge skills for monster identification. Think about getting the Dangerously Curious trait and the Divine Deception feat to pump Use Magic Device, because wands and scrolls (especially from the Cleric list) greatly expand your spellcasting options.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Dom</span><span class="c16">ain:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">You only get one, unlike a Cleric, and you don&#39;t get any of the bonus spells unless you&rsquo;re a Green Faith Marshal. That said, the domains feature powerful options to fit just about any playstyle. Even if there are no good domains in your deity&rsquo;s portfolio (lookin&rsquo; at you, Gozreh) you can always substitute an Inquisition for your domain.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Weapon</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c16">Proficiencies:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">You&#39;re proficient with </span><span class="c35 c51 c37">simple weapons, hand crossbow, shortbow,</span><span class="c35 c51">&nbsp;</span><span class="c14 c51">repeating crossbow,</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c35 c42 c51">longbow.</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;The other weapon proficiency you get is up to your choice of deity; these options can range from great, like Gorum&#39;s </span><span class="c35 c42 c51">greatsword,</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;to terrible, like Irori&#39;s </span><span class="c46 c35 c51">unarmed strike.</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Your race selection might also provide options for expanded weapon proficiencies, a fact that I encourage you to consider as you build an Inquisitor.</span><span class="c73 c35">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c12"></span></p><h2 class="c18" id="h.mifppnmw9x3c"><span class="c24 c58">Class Features</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c48"><span class="c19">(1)</span><span class="c19 c21">&nbsp;Judgment:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Judgment is one of your better class features, and I think it&#39;s a shame that I see it used so artlessly so much of the time. &quot;Which Judgments are you pronouncing?&quot; I&rsquo;ll ask in a session. &quot;Justice and Destruction,&quot; comes the expected answer, right on cue. From a design perspective, those choices make sense: Pathfinder at higher levels devolves into a game of rocket tag where players are penalized for doing anything other than liquefying their enemies as quickly as possible. When the enemy is slinging around world-ending magic that can kill you with one or two unlucky die rolls, any action other than murdering as fast as possible starts to look like a sucker&rsquo;s move.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c48"><span class="c28">In an ideal world, however, I believe that each of the Judgments would have a niche in which it could operate on equal footing with the other Judgments. Up against a horde of weaker enemies? Resiliency for DR. Up against one big bruiser? Protection for AC. Up against casters or undead? Purity. Up against elementals? Resistance. The issue is that many of the Judgments are simply too weak to justify picking them, an issue that I think merits some buffs to the &ldquo;lesser&rdquo; Judgments. As it stands, there are no meaningful alternatives to Justice, Destruction, and Purity; consequently, there are no incentives for using Judgment creatively to invent new tactics. This dynamic leads to an exodus out of the base class and into archetypes, many of which trade away Judgment entirely. I&rsquo;ll be proposing my changes to Judgment below, and I&rsquo;d encourage fellow GMs not to see that as threatening. Judgments need to be equivalent in order for the opportunity cost of picking one over another to be impactful, and defense will never be such an overwhelmingly powerful option in Pathfinder that you risk making a player OP. Inquisitors constantly opting for the boost to damage and to-hit? Now </span><span class="c6">that</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;breaks encounters...and mechanics aside, I know you&rsquo;re tired of handing your players nails just because they won&rsquo;t pick up any tool other than that damn hammer.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Destruction:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Straightforward and good. No fixes needed.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c20 c28">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Healing:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Rare will be the combat that lasts long enough for this to heal a significant amount of damage. If you are anticipating a longer fight, sure, drop it at the beginning and let it do its work</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">every little bit helps.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c84"><span class="c12">((Three fixes to this one: first, bump the fast healing up to 2 to begin with. Second, make the Judgment last half your level in rounds, minimum 1, after combat finishes, as long as it remained unchanged throughout combat. Third, stabilize automatically when reduced to negative hit points, again as long as Healing Judgment had been active for the entire combat. Taken together, these three changes make your healing factor a bit more potent, net you some free post-combat recovery, and prevent you from bleeding out absent a Heal check.))</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Justice:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Sacred or profane bonus, which will stack with just about every other bonus you can get. This is what makes you equivalent to a full-BAB class, and much as I hate to say it, it&#39;ll be your go-to Judgment for your whole career if your GM doesn&#39;t like the fixes provided here.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Pierc</span><span class="c19 c21">ing:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Spell Resistance is a definite problem for full casters who want to land debuffs or save-or-dies. Remember that grinding sound you heard coming from your Sorcerer&rsquo;s teeth when she whiffed on that </span><span class="c6">disintegrate?</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Yeah, that was SR at work. </span><span class="c28 c37">You won&#39;t be needing much SR penetration,</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;because you won&#39;t be casting debuffs or save-or-dies (saves-or-die, like attorneys general?) with any regularity; the </span><span class="c28 c21">better bonus</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;is the boost to concentration for when you&#39;re casting defensively, which will be much of the time.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c84"><span class="c12">((Honestly, the bonus to concentration checks seems out of place here, being more defensive than offensive. I&#39;d keep the SR penetration, but add +1 to the save DC of a particular spell or school at 1st, 7th, 13th, and 19th levels. You still won&#39;t be able to compete with full casters (not much room for metamagic, fewer spells per day, lower DCs despite the buff) but it would bridge the gap enough that a dedicated WIS build could feel more confident stepping into a combat casting role.))</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Protection:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;The bonus here is just too piddly. Past 13th level or so enemies are capable of buggering your AC six ways from Sunday no matter how hard you&#39;ve focused on it, so it&#39;s always been to your benefit in Pathfinder to focus on other elements of defense (e.g., saves, DR, energy resistance) that can help you when AC starts to fall flat.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">((I can think of three potential fixes to this Judgment, all different, and all with their own benefits and drawbacks:</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c12"></span></p><ol class="c44 lst-kix_wb3arzn57bpi-0 start" start="1"><li class="c7 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c12">Double the bonus AC at every increment and give the same bonus to CMD. It&#39;s simple, but a little inelegant.</span></li><li class="c7 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c12">At 1st level, you gain a bonus equivalent to what partial cover would give you (+2 AC, +1 Reflex); at 7th, the bonus jumps up to the equivalent of regular cover (+4 AC, +2 Reflex); at 13th, you get a constant 15% miss chance, and at 18th, that miss chance jumps to 30%. In this scenario, you still provoke AoOs, and your bonuses only stack up to what normal cover or concealment would provide (i.e., you do not receive additional bonuses at 1st level for partial cover, and total concealment at 18th level only gets you to 50%, not 80%).</span></li><li class="c7 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c12">Add the ability to negate some amount of AoOs or iteratives per round with a Sense Motive/Intimidate check, flavored as the Inquisitor being able to intuit how and where an enemy will attempt to strike, or striking enough fear that the enemy falters for a split second. This option capitalizes on Stern Gaze and helps characters survive later levels, where iterative attacks, reach, and horrible riders on successful hits are commonplace.))</span></li></ol><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Purity:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Awesome bonus to all saves, and double for curses, poisons, and diseases at 10th level. Too awesome, even.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c84"><span class="c12">((My only nerf on the list. Either lose the bonus to all saves, or else give us a flat +2 or something vs. curses, poisons, and diseases. It&rsquo;s too much.))</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Resiliency:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;DR is universally great. The issue you&rsquo;ll run into later is that nearly every enemy will have the means to bypass your DR.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c84"><span class="c28">((If I were going to fix this ability, I&#39;d bump up DR every third level instead of every fifth, move DR/Alignment to 7th level, and make 13th level DR/</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c28">. If DR/</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;was too excessive, I&#39;d maybe keep it at DR/Alignment and add SR to the DR gained every third level, maybe starting at 10 or 15. It won&rsquo;t break the bank, because players would be opting out of offensive options in order to use Resiliency. Just remember that: opportunity costs.))</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Resistance:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;You won&#39;t always need it, but when you do, it&#39;s invaluable. Stacks with </span><span class="c6 c55">resist energy.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c84"><span class="c28">((As with so many of the defensive options on this list, I just think Resistance is too lackluster. Why should you have to wait until 13th level to get the amount of benefit you could have gotten by casting </span><span class="c6">resist energy,</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;a 2nd-level spell? Makes no sense to me. So, my proposed change: linear growth, 1 point of energy resistance per level, but does not stack with </span><span class="c6">resist energy</span><span class="c12">. You get to decide whether you want to burn the spell slot for full protection or burn a Judgment for a less heavy duty effect.))</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Smiting:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;The Inquisitor&rsquo;s Bane class ability functions as a temporary increase to enhancement bonus, not a permanent increase, as in the weapon enchantment. Practically, this means that we can&rsquo;t penetrate greater forms of DR just by switching on Bane. We&rsquo;ve got </span><span class="c6">align weapon</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;on our spell list, but the rest is up to us. That makes Smiting pretty decent!</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c84"><span class="c28">((Looking at what you&#39;ve got already makes it clear what you need: the ability to pierce DR/</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c28">. Based on the trajectory of the base ability, I&#39;d stick that in around 14th level. If that&#39;s off the table (and I get it, monsters have DR/</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;for a reason) you might arrange some kind of ability to &quot;sunder&quot; or otherwise negate natural armor bonuses (Flensing Strike is a good example of how this might be done), nullify supernatural senses, or ignore select immunities/resistances of monsters you&rsquo;ve identified. Again, GM fiat reigns supreme here, but they&#39;re all options to discuss.))</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c48"><span class="c19">(1) </span><span class="c16">Monster Lore:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">Monster Lore&#39;s one of those abilities that effortlessly improves your ability to play multiple roles in just about any party; it gives you your WIS bonus in addition to INT on all Knowledge rolls made to identify creatures, which can be some of the most critical checks to pass to identify fast healing, regeneration, DR, SR, etc. It&#39;s a favorite for archetypes to trade away, but try to keep it if you can</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c28">it&#39;ll serve you well, especially if your GM insists that you pass a check to gain meta-knowledge of monster type weaknesses or other vulnerabilities. Nothing worse than watching your Rogue friend try to </span><span>sneak attack</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;an Elemental because &quot;Johnny O&rsquo;Gankshanks didn&#39;t know it was an Elemental!&quot; (Thanks to /u/Ro9ge for reminding me that Constructs, happily, can be sneak attacked!)</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c28 c41 c21">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c48"><span class="c19">(1) </span><span class="c19 c21">Stern Gaze:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Stern Gaze is the ability that puts mechanical </span><span class="c6">oomph</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;behind your roleplaying inquisitoriality</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c28">and yes, I&#39;m sticking with that word</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">by giving you a bonus equal to half your level (minimum +1) to Sense Motive and Intimidate. If that shopkeep is wondering whether he managed to cheat you out of a few extra gold, gulp, he definitely didn&#39;t. Then you crack your knuckles and remark on what a lovely shop he has, and what a pity it would be if anything happened to it. Inquisitors are savvy, perceptive, slightly foreboding figures in their faiths, and Stern Gaze gives you the firepower you need to project that image. Some favored class bonuses (notably the Half-Orc&#39;s) can give you a boost to Stern Gaze, making for even more powerful fear-wielders.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c48"><span class="c19">(1) </span><span class="c19 c21">Detect Alignment:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Unless your enemies are packing some high-caliber abjuration magic, </span><span class="c6">detect alignment</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;will let you flag potential enemies before they reveal themselves to </span><span class="c6">be</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;enemies. If you&#39;re banking on encountering many enemies of the same monster type within a certain area, Monster Lore can help give you information about which alignment to &quot;scan&quot; for (e.g., you&#39;d want to use </span><span class="c6">detect chaos</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;when scanning for Fey).</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c48"><span class="c19">(2) </span><span class="c16">Cunning Initiative:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Getting your WIS bonus to initiative in addition to DEX is amazing because, well, it&#39;s always better to shoot first. Han would have made an excellent Inquisitor. Going first lets you pronounce Judgment faster, lay down self-buffs, move into an advantageous position, etc. Very few reasons not to be an initiative junkie in a game like Pathfinder, where the upper levels encourage a &ldquo;who shoots first, shoots last&rdquo; mentality. Combine with traits like Reactionary or feats like Improved Initiative for even more madness.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c48"><span class="c19">(2) </span><span class="c19 c37">Track:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Using Survival to follow tracks is situational, to be sure, but nearly nobody does it better than you, between Track and the spells you get that also improve the Survival. It&#39;s thematic, too, what with Inquisitors being the &quot;you can run, but you can&#39;t hide&quot; class.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c48"><span class="c19">(3) </span><span class="c19 c21">Solo Tactics and Teamwork Feats:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;I&#39;m going to include these together, as they&#39;re basically a single feature. You&#39;ll get a whole mess of Teamwork feats throughout your career; rather than grant these feats to teammates as a Cavalier would, however, you act </span><span class="c6">as if</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;they had those feats for the purposes of determining which benefits you get, which neatly eliminates the problem of getting your team to coordinate feat selection. Allied Spellcaster, Coordinated Charge, Outflank, Lookout, Shake It Off</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">there are more Teamwork feats published all the time, and some of them are very powerful. Many players tend to forget about these or trade them away, despite their strength if your tactics are solid.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c28 c41 c42">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c48"><span class="c19">(5) </span><span class="c16">Bane:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">You merely adopted the dark! Bane is amazing and definitely qualifies as one of the class-defining abilities of an Inquisitor. Of note, the +2 enhancement bonus stacks past +5, but I&rsquo;ve heard conflicting reports about whether that enhancement bonus allows you to penetrate exotic forms of DR (Cold Iron at +3, Adamantine at +4, and Alignment at +5). Check with your GM, because I&rsquo;ve not been able to find a Paizo-official errata about it yet. You&#39;re probably starting to notice that Inquisitors are strapped for swift actions between Bane and Judgment. Thankfully, many of your best self-buffs are standard actions, so you can Judgment + Move + Buff in Round 1 to get near your position, then Bane + 5-ft. Step + Full Attack in Round 2. In general, I think it&#39;s okay to metagame your knowledge of types and subtypes a little here</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">if you&#39;re clearly fighting goblins, there&#39;s no reason to roll a knowledge check for it before declaring your bane.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c48"><span class="c19">(5) </span><span class="c19 c37">Discern</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c19 c21">Lies:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;The immediate action means that you should be able to activate it as someone says an utterance to fact-check it. Will negates, and there&#39;s no restriction on being intentionally evasive. Then again, Inquisitors specialize in squeezing straight answers out of, shall we say, </span><span class="c6">uncooperative</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;persons, so you might need this power only occasionally.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c48"><span class="c19">(8) </span><span class="c16">Second Judgment:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;You get two Judgments instead of one whenever you activate the ability. Manifestly great.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c28 c41 c21">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c48"><span class="c19">(11) </span><span class="c19 c21">Stalwart:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">It&#39;s basically </span><span>evasion</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;for Fortitude and Will saves</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">if a passed save would do half effect, you instead get no effect. There aren&#39;t as many Fort- or Will-partial spells/abilities as there are Reflex-partial spells/abilities, which is the only reason it gets green instead of blue. It also doesn&#39;t function in heavy armor, which screws Inquisitors who dumped DEX and invested.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c48"><span class="c19">(12) </span><span class="c16">Greater Bane:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Woooooo woooooo, all aboard the Bane Train! Yessiree, 4d6 damage on top of every hit turns you into even more of a buzzsaw than you were already.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c48"><span class="c19">(14) </span><span class="c19 c37">Exploit</span><span class="c19 c21">&nbsp;Weakness:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Sure, why not? Not every enemy has DR, and you won&#39;t be dealing a critical every round unless you built around that, but it&#39;s a nice effect when it happens.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c48"><span class="c19">(16) </span><span class="c16">Third Judgment:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Your final Judgment expansion doesn&#39;t disappoint, of course.

Most CR 20 creatures have Fort saves in the 18-25 ballpark; assuming your WIS caps out at 22-26, you&#39;re looking at save DCs in the 26-28 range.

It&rsquo;s nothing concrete, just a handful of design decisions that together encourage or discourage you from pursuing certain options in a fracas. Here are your incentives and disincentives:</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><ol class="c44 lst-kix_lfmnw5o3yaom-0 start" start="1"><li class="c97 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c19">Inquisitors have &frac34; BAB and spell progressions.</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;These incentivize you to cast personal- or team-oriented spells, rather than enemy-targeted spells; they also discourage you from pursuing high-BAB feat lines like the Improved Critical, Vital Strike, or Two-Weapon Fighting families. With lower BAB comes lower CMB, as well, meaning your maneuvers won&rsquo;t ever be workable without specific help (the Crime Inquisition, e.g., grants a bunch of Steal feats, and the Battle Mystery can help Ravener Hunters get pretty good at one maneuver).</span></li><li class="c97 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c19">Inquisitors get no bonus feats.</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;This incentivizes you to stick with builds that can be combat-effective with as little feat investment as possible.

Because you can&rsquo;t rely too heavily on save DC boosts, however, it&rsquo;s best to supplement with methods of lower your opponents&rsquo; saves. Some domains (Madness especially) can drop Will saves down, but your best bet is to make enemies shaken and sickened, both of which apply a -2 penalty to saves.

Nonlethal damage is its own discussion, but the big advantage of Enforcer is the fact that you cause them to be shaken for a number of rounds equal to the damage you dealt.

Don&rsquo;t bother with the Merciful Bane feat</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">the lethal damage from Bane and the nonlethal damage from your weapon will meet in the middle somewhere.

Every deity has five domains available to his or her adherents, but there are a variety of Empyreal Lords, Archdevils, and other powerful planar beings that may have a domain portfolio, too. The class that normally interacts the most with the domains is the Cleric: they pick two domains, each of which grants them an exclusive list of domain-only bonus spells. As I mentioned earlier, Inquisitors also get access to domains, but on a much more limited basis. Where Clerics get two domains, Inquisitors get one; where Clerics get bonus spells, Inquisitors do not. Other than that, Inquisitors&rsquo; domain abilities function as their Cleric brethren and sistrens&rsquo; do. In addition to the normal domains available to you depending on your choice of deity, Inquisitors also have the option of picking an Inquisition; these &ldquo;mini-domains&rdquo; are based around ideals that an Inquisitor might pursue regardless of deity. Green Faith Marshals get access to the Animal and Terrain Domains, so I&rsquo;ll be reviewing those, too.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span

If you intend to use seduction as a tactic in your game, clear it with your group and be prepared to give up the tactic if anyone expresses discomfort: remember, you will never know who at your table has been sexually assaulted. Respectful player decisions lead to group cohesion and immersion, and group cohesion and immersion lead to lots of fun, so make sure you explicitly ask your group (including your GM!) what they&rsquo;re comfortable with before RPing any sexy times.</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c96"><td class="c53" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Disarming Flirtation:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Coercing someone who wouldn&#39;t normally talk to you into talking to you is mostly fluff, but the bit about using it to feint and denying them attacks against you is interesting.

In addition to having fewer spell slots available to you at any one time, your save DCs will never measure up to the full casters&rsquo;. Practically, this means that Inquisitors will only want to learn spells that allow for a save if they&rsquo;re really, </span><span class="c6">really</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;good. Otherwise, you simply can&rsquo;t afford the risk that you&rsquo;ll charge up, spend your standard action to cast in the middle of a frantic combat, possibly take an AoO or roll a concentration check...only to have the enemy pass their save effortlessly. Nothing is more frustrating than a wasted spell slot, so we&rsquo;ll focus on buff spells and debuff/damage spells that have partial effects even on successful saves.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c28">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spontaneous casting also differs enough from prepared casting to merit some discussion. Prepared casters such as Clerics can afford to prepare situationally useful spells (think </span><span class="c6">consecrate, zone of truth,</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;or </span><span class="c6">sanctify corpse</span><span class="c28">) if they feel that those scenarios will be likely during an adventuring day. Inquisitors need to think more concretely. Will the spell be useful to me </span><span class="c6">every</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;day? Will the spell work consistently across many enemy types, with many configurations of saves and abilities, across many levels? What are my &ldquo;desert island&rdquo; spells? Only the best of the best should pass muster for spontaneous casters, because you&rsquo;ll always be limited in the number of spells that you know. Now, this same math does not hold for scrolls and wands, which allow Inquisitors to prepare for less common circumstances as long as they&rsquo;re willing to supplement their spellcasting financially. A table of scroll and wand costs is included below; spells that are ideal candidates for scrolls or wands will be highlighted in </span><span class="c19">black.</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Our calculus will favor scrolls and wands for out-of-combat applications, where they&rsquo;re the least dangerous to use, and spells for in-combat applications.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a final note, I&rsquo;m not paying any attention in this list to which spells are legal in Pathfinder Society, mainly because I don&rsquo;t play. Archives of Nethys puts a symbol next to each spell that can give you that information.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><a id="t.e05e7aad1bc5c2a1a844db9248debeb46dc42ae6"></a><a id="t.122"></a><table class="c113"><tbody><tr class="c167"><td class="c91 c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0"><span class="c31">Spell Level &amp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c31">Minimum Inquisitor Level</span></p></td><td class="c15" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0"><span class="c31">Scroll</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c31">(Spell Level x Caster Level x 25 gp)</span></p></td><td class="c54 c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0"><span class="c31">Wand</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c31">(Spell Level x Caster Level x 750 gp)</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c88"><td class="c91" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0"><span class="c24 c19">Orisons (0th-Level) at 1st Level</span></p></td><td class="c89" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0"><span class="c12">12.5 gp</span></p></td><td class="c54" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0"><span class="c12">375 gp</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c88"><td class="c91" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0"><span class="c24 c19">1st-Level Spells at 1st Level</span></p></td><td class="c89" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0"><span class="c12">25 gp</span></p></td><td class="c54" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0"><span class="c12">750 gp</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c88"><td class="c91" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0"><span class="c24 c19">2nd-Level Spells at 4th Level</span></p></td><td class="c89" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0"><span class="c12">200 gp</span></p></td><td class="c54" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0"><span class="c12">6,000 gp</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c88"><td class="c91" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0"><span class="c24 c19">3rd-Level Spells at 7th Level</span></p></td><td class="c89" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0"><span class="c12">525 gp</span></p></td><td class="c54" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0"><span class="c12">15,750 gp</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c88"><td class="c91" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0"><span class="c24 c19">4th-Level Spells at 10th Level</span></p></td><td class="c89" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0"><span class="c12">1,000 gp</span></p></td><td class="c54" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0"><span class="c12">30,000 gp</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c88"><td class="c91" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0"><span class="c24 c19">5th-Level Spells at 13th Level</span></p></td><td class="c89" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0"><span class="c12">1,625 gp</span></p></td><td class="c54" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0"><span>&mdash;</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c88"><td class="c91" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0"><span class="c24 c19">6th-Level Spells at 16th Level</span></p></td><td class="c89" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0"><span class="c12">2,400 gp</span></p></td><td class="c54" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0"><span>&mdash;</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 class="c18" id="h.t14r8up1byyi"><span class="c24 c58">Orisons</span></h2><p class="c7"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Detect Magic:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;You&#39;ll need it, so get it.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Guidance:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Competence bonus.

Yes, Bless is good. Good use of spells known, good way to help the team.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Divine Favor:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Luck bonus. Good bonus, stacks with luck-enhancing traits like Fate&#39;s Favored, long enough duration to last during a combat. All signs are go for a blue.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Fallback Strategy:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Torag worshiper only. A non-specific reroll on any d20 you want for minutes per level is formidable. Torag is truly the god of contingency planning.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">False Face:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Nice long duration, and you can maintain a stable of identities that are ready to be assumed at a moment&rsquo;s notice. Great for intrigue, infiltration, or simple catfishing.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Keep Watch:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;A super underrated quality of life spell, especially if someone on your team is into crafting. The fact that it will eventually scale to include everyone in its effect is cool, too.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Wrath:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Morale bonus. Stacks with </span><span class="c6">divine favor,</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;and gives Improved Critical on top of that at level 12.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Bane:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">Bless</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;is better, but </span><span class="c6">bane</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;still isn&#39;t too bad. Just don&#39;t count on the BBEG failing his save...for you.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Barbed Chains:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;A gem of a spell in the early and mid game: trip is good, shaken is good, frightened is even better. Later, when you&#39;re fighting big enemies, enemies that fly, enemies with ungodly CMD scores, etc., this doesn&rsquo;t do much.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Ears of the City:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Get the low-down on any location, topic, or rumor without tipping anyone off or spending time. And use your Perception skill instead of Diplomacy to do it! Win, win, win.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Expeditious Retreat:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Enhancement bonus. Can always find a use for more movement speed, and at minutes/level it wouldn&rsquo;t make a bad wand. The enhancement bonus won&#39;t stack with </span><span class="c6">haste</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;or Boots of Springing and Striding.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Hedging Weapons:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">Deflection bonus. Won&#39;t stack with your Ring of Protection, but can definitely help alleviate the pain of not having one if you truly need that ring slot. Depending on your deity, the weapons might deal more damage than your real favored weapon, and in DR-ignoring, incorporeal-hitting force damage, too. A strong contender to beat </span><span class="c6 c55">spiritual weapon.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Heightened Awareness:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Competence bonus. Nice duration, and synergizes naturally with your WIS focus and Monster Lore ability. The initiative boost is just icing.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Litany of Sloth:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Swift action cast is interesting, as is the clause about preventing someone from casting defensively. Pity it only lasts one round.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Opportunistic Loyalty:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Help yourself to an enemy caster&rsquo;s buffs! Quite, quite good.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Protection from [Alignment]:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Deflection and resistance bonuses. Good AC and save bonuses, though they won&#39;t stack with Rings of Protection or Cloaks of Resistance. The enchantment and bodily contact clauses are more interesting. </span><span class="c6">Protection from Evil</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;is likely your best bet if you have to pick one.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Secret Sign:</span><span class="c28 c21">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">Not at all your typical powergaming selection, </span><span class="c6">secret sign</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;is nevertheless a great pick for creative players. Tell the town watch that the spy will be designated by a certain invisible mark, then watch your rival get nicked. Set a mark for a heist that your group is pulling. Fill a room with cursed or trapped items and mark the one safe item. Convince someone they&rsquo;re receiving messages from the gods because they really are the only one who can see the writing on the wall. Options galore, with the only limit being &nbsp;your </span><span class="c19">i m a g i n a t i o n</span><span class="c12">.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Secret Speech:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">Calistria worshiper only. It&rsquo;s weird</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">it&rsquo;s not a language of its own, like Thieves&rsquo; Cant, but rather a flexible message that you can hide within any parcel of spoken language: whether my mouth says &ldquo;It&rsquo;s lovely weather we&rsquo;ve been having lately, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; or &ldquo;So, how did you begin your career in burlesque dancing?&rdquo; you (and everyone that I mentally designate) still understand &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t drink that soup, it&rsquo;s poisoned.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s a nice ability.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Strand of the Tangled Knot:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Nifty defensive ability that could absorb some big blows if your timing is good.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c20 c19">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Aspect of the Nightingale:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Competence bonus, Shelyn worshiper only. The best aspect of this spell (if you&rsquo;ll forgive the pun) is the reroll against Charm spells. Minor buffs to Perform and Diplomacy are mostly fluff.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Cause Fear:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Decent for early levels, but doesn&#39;t scale at all.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Compel Hostility:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Of more use if you&#39;re a tankier Inquisitor.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Detect Demon:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;It&#39;s ironically better at early levels</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">if you use it at higher levels, you&#39;re likely to accidentally stun yourself by detecting a demon with very high mental scores.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Detect Undead:</span><span class="c28 c37">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">Similar to </span><span class="c6">detect demon.</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Note that you can get an at-will version of this through an Exorcist&#39;s Aspergillum (Wondrous Item).</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Ear-Piercing Scream:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;You&#39;re no blaster, but this scales reasonably well and sonic damage is rarely resisted. Worth consideration.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Egorian Diplomacy:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">The main downside to using Intimidate in social contexts is that people tend not to respond positively when you threaten to murder their family. This spell can take that downside away, pending a Will save. I&rsquo;d still recommend using Diplomacy as often as you can</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">more flies with honey, and all that jazz.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Hide from Undead: </span><span class="c12">This could actually be pretty useful in some situations.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Hide Weapon:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;For Cloaked Wolves and other weapon-hiders only.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Lend Judgment:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Judgments can be very powerful, and allies can always benefit.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Litany of Weakness:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Forcing that big bruiser not to run or charge at the start of combat could be an interesting tactical choice.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Lock Gaze:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Concealment for the rest of your team is good, but you&#39;re unlikely to be able to stick this on the BBEG as you&#39;d usually want to, since Will negates.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Longshot:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Good especially for Black Powder Inquisition or thrown weapon builds.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Lucky Number: </span><span class="c12">Luck bonus. A fun little spell that will find a use no matter what the initial roll comes up as. Low? Reroll! Middling? +2!</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Remove Fear:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">It&#39;s a good bonus, but situational.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Shadowfade:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">It&rsquo;s </span><span class="c6">invisibility,</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;but only functioning in areas of darkness.

Useful before you get that Ring of Protection. </span><span class="c6">Hedging weapons</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;probably retains a little more high-level utility.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Abadar&rsquo;s Truthtelling:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Abadar worshiper only. It&rsquo;s </span><span class="c6">zone of truth,</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;but as a 1st-level spell. Decent scroll.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Alarm:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Situational, but potentially useful. I&rsquo;d sooner pick up </span><span class="c6">keep watch,</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;which has other benefits, too. Either one you pick, a wand won&rsquo;t cost you much and will keep you going for many, many nights of adventuring.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Brand of Conformity: </span><span class="c12">This is a really cruel spell, actually; it permanently destroys the target&#39;s ability to speak its native language. That&rsquo;s cool flavor for an evil Inquisitor, but mechanically only worth a scroll.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Cloak of Secrets:</span><span class="c28 c37">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Excellent for intrigue-heavy campaigns and all the private whisperings therein. A scroll will suffice.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Cure Light Wounds: </span><span class="c28">The wand pick </span><span class="c6">par excellence.</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;You&rsquo;ll take enough damage in a day that you can&rsquo;t afford to burn all your spell slots on </span><span class="c6 c55">cure light wounds.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Deadeye&#39;s Lore:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Sacred bonus. This spell plus your existing Track ability is interesting, and you might need to track at some point.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Disguise Self: </span><span class="c12">Untyped bonus. Just get a Hat of Disguise, or a scroll if you absolutely can&rsquo;t muster the gold to buy the item.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Funereal Weapon: </span><span class="c6">Funereal weapon</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;is a decent spell for its level, but if you can hold out a little longer, you&rsquo;ll get </span><span class="c6">huntmaster&rsquo;s spear,</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;which pierces </span><span class="c6">all</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;DR for specified enemies. I&rsquo;ll bite as a scroll, though.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Nature&#39;s Paths:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s definitely no candidate for a spell known, but would be excellent as a wand or scroll for outdoor tracking and general expeditioning, especially if you don&rsquo;t have a Hunter, Ranger, Druid, etc. on the team.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Peasant Armaments:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Milani worshiper only. Here&rsquo;s what </span><span class="c6">desperate weapon </span><span class="c12">wanted to be: weapons for the whole team, they function as the closest simple or martial equivalents, and everybody gets proficiency.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Recharge Innate Magic: </span><span class="c12">Okay if you have some.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Refine Improvised Weapon: </span><span class="c28">If you&rsquo;re not a worshiper of Milani, here&rsquo;s your other option for the times when you find yourself weaponless. I&rsquo;m 99% sure that Samwise Gamgee was just constantly casting this on his cast iron frying pan throughout the events of </span><span class="c6 c55">Fellowship.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Sanctify Corpse:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">Sanctify corpse</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;is a scroll, if it&rsquo;s anything. Even then, only good in necromancy-heavy campaigns.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Shield of Fortification:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Sneak attacks and crits will mess you up but good. </span><span class="c6">Fortification </span><span class="c28">armor, however, is extraordinarily expensive, clocking in at +1, +3, or +5 enhancement bonus (for 25% chance to negate, 50% chance, and 75% chance, respectively). As a 1st-level spell, </span><span class="c6">shield of fortification</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;could conceivably make a good wand, protecting you over many battles. If you&rsquo;re looking for more than a 25% chance to negate, you&rsquo;ll have to wait for a scroll of </span><span class="c6">greater shield of fortification</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;when you get access to 3rd-level spells.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Speechreader&rsquo;s Sight:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;As a scroll, it&rsquo;s good at its job. Getting it made permanent for 2,500 gp is an interesting option in intrigue-heavy campaigns.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Sure Casting:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s kind of like </span><span class="c6">true strike,</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;but for Spell Resistance. That won&rsquo;t become prevalent for a while, but it&rsquo;s never too early to pick up a wand</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">you&rsquo;ll use it later on.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">True Strike:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Insight bonus. When you need it, you really need it. For my money, a wand is best.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">True Appraisal:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Maybe, </span><span class="c6">maybe</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;as a scroll for that one time when you come across an enormous hoard of treasure and have to assess it accurately and quickly. Otherwise, get someone in town to do this. I don&rsquo;t know of many GMs who are willing to put up with the finicky Appraise rules solely for the purposes of cheating their players out of a few gold.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Weaponwand: </span><span class="c28">Wands are great, hence the ability to use them without sacrificing a hand to wield is also great. Although there&rsquo;s a danger of recursion and subsequent space-time paradoxes, a wand of </span><span class="c6">weaponwand</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;used in conjunction with </span><span class="c6">sure casting </span><span class="c28">or </span><span class="c6">true strike</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;would be quite potent.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Animal Purpose Training:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp; Sacred Huntsmasters will be training Handle Animal anyway. No one else needs it.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Authenticating Gaze:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;I like it for flavor; it&rsquo;s far too niche for a spell known or even a scroll, however.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Batrachian Surge:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Grippli only. Water breathing, swim speeds, etc. are great bonuses; however, at a handful of rounds per casting, the benefit won&rsquo;t stick around long enough for you to enjoy them. At least it&rsquo;s a swift action to cast.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Bed of Iron:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Sleep out of your armor, or get a </span><span class="c6">comfort</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;enchantment for a few gold.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Bless Water:</span><span class="c28 c46">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Just ask a local Cleric to make some for you.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Blessing of the Watch:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">Morale bonus. Welp, they did it: they found a way to make </span><span class="c6">bless</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;bad. This is an NPC spell, really.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Bowstaff:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">You&#39;re better off just having a back-up weapon.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Burst Bonds:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">Escaping manacles or shackles is far too situational, and later on you&rsquo;ll have </span><span class="c6">freedom of movement.</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Scrolls don&rsquo;t really work, either, as anytime you&rsquo;re bound you&rsquo;re likely to have your possessions stripped, too.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Command:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">One round, limited commands, Will save negates. Meh.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Curse Water:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">Of even less use in most campaigns than </span><span class="c6 c55">bless water.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Deadeye&rsquo;s Arrow: </span><span class="c12">Erastil worshiper only. It&rsquo;s a weak blast, and you&rsquo;ve got mundane ways to achieve the beacon effect.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Desperate Weapon:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">It doesn&rsquo;t eliminate any of the penalties for using an improvised weapon, so even if you do find yourself needing a weapon desperately, this spell does no better than just picking something up at random.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Detect [Alignment]:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Only good if you&#39;ve taken an archetype that traded away your at-will version of all four of these.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Detect Faithful:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;If you need to find out where other members of your faith are, ask around. Won&rsquo;t be a problem unless you worship Lamashtu or something.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Doom: </span><span class="c12">Standard action demoralize isn&rsquo;t a good use of actions when using Intimidate, and it&rsquo;s no better in spell form.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Fabricate Disguise:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;All it does is shorten how long it takes to create a mundane disguise, a power that is the very definition of niche.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Forbid Action:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">There are too many ways to mess you up that don&rsquo;t involve your forbidden action.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Forced Quiet:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">Short duration, limited use. Wait a level for </span><span class="c6 c55">silence.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Gorum&rsquo;s Armor:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a tiny amount of damage, and only applies against natural attacks. Skip.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Grappling Scarf: </span><span class="c12">Some free silk rope is okay. Everyone will be flying eventually, though.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Guardian Armor:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">People have the armor they have for a reason. Monks don&#39;t need it; arcane casters don&#39;t want it due to spell failure; everyone else probably has armor the same as yours or better than yours. Why are you casting this, again?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Handy Grapnel:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Grappling arrows already exist.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Haze of Dreams:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Desna worshiper only. Short duration, will save negates, one target, weak effect.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Hex Ward:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">How often will you fight witches?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Hidden Diplomacy:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Two chances to fail: the Intimidate check itself and the Will save. Just get Pearly Colgate the Paladin to use Diplomacy.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Hide Bruises:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Even for Evil characters, the benefit is minor. NPC spell.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Hobble:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Targets get a save every round, and the spell doesn&rsquo;t prevent 5-foot steps.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Horn of Pursuit:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Announce your presence to everyone, why don&#39;t you?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Inflict Light Wounds:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Maybe hit them with a weapon instead?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Instant Clot:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Bleed effects are fairly rare.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Instant Portrait:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">For those many times when you need to describe a perp to the city watch. /s</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Interrogation:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;One question per two caster levels, and they&#39;re still free to lie to you? Nope.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Invisibility Alarm:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Somehow even less useful than </span><span class="c6 c55">alarm.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Itching Curse:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Weak effect, Will save negates, doesn&#39;t scale past 5 HD. Pass.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Know the Enemy:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Insight bonus. It&rsquo;s a good benefit that suffers from a 1-minute casting time. Unusable in combat.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Linebreaker:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Half-orc only. You probably won&#39;t be doing much bull rushing or overrunning.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Open and Shut:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">So it&#39;s an illusion spell...but only for doors.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Peacebond:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">A standard action will foil you here, as the people whose weapons you most want to glue to their bodies will be the most able to beat the STR check.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Persuasive Goad: </span><span class="c12">Circumstance bonus. Neither the bonus nor the damage scales. You&rsquo;re better off using some items to achieve a higher Intimidate score.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Pick Your Poison:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Cayden Cailean worshiper only. At best, it buys you a little time to cure the poison that&rsquo;s actually affecting your teammate and prevent ability damage.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Pierce Facade:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Better to pump your general Perception score, rather than boosting it specifically to see through disguises.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Planar Orientation:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">This is niche even for a prepared spell, and that&rsquo;s saying something.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Poisoned Egg:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Norgorber worshiper only. Most poison is mechanically bad. This poison is mechanically worse.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Preserve Grace:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Develop your own moral compass, please.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Returning Weapon:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Pretty useless. Even thrown weapon builds will want a Blinkback Belt or something similar, because the </span><span class="c6">returning</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;enchantment fails if you move after throwing.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Reveal Secrets:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Will negates, which might be a Very Big Deal&copy; since your target immediately becomes aware that you tried to magically compel them to reveal the secret. Most folk don&rsquo;t take kindly to that.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Sanctuary:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Sooner or later, you need to attack.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Scarify:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;</span><span>nonlethal</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;damaged is healed in parallel with lethal damage, but that&rsquo;s the only perk to this spell. I&rsquo;d sooner just heal a little extra lethal damage with a wand of </span><span class="c6 c55">cure light wounds.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Speak Local Language:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Hindered by the fact that </span><span class="c6">you</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;have to know the language that you&rsquo;re imparting. You probably won&rsquo;t be putting many skill ranks in Linguistics, so...</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Spiked Armor:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Here&#39;s an idea: get armor spikes!</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Stalwart Resolve:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Great effect that will won&rsquo;t do you a bit of good at rounds per level.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Stunning Barrier:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s the same basic idea as </span><span class="c6">strand of the tangled knot,</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;but this spell has a tiny bonus where the other spell has a huge bonus.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Theft Ward:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Tengu only. Whoa! Whoa! Who&rsquo;s in my personal space? &nbsp;No one, ya dingus. Stop letting your shit get stolen.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Tireless Pursuit:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Do you know anyone who uses the rules for forced marching? No? Neither do I.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Touch of Combustion: </span><span class="c12">Ifrit only. Terrible damage spell. As weak as they come.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Unerring Weapon:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Bonuses to confirmation rolls are weak; you&#39;re not a Swashbuckler. Duration is too short, too.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Vocal Alteration:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Good for Vigilantes, not for you.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Wartrain Mount:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;If you&#39;re a Sacred Huntsmaster, you&#39;ll be investing in Handle Animal anyway.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Weapons Against Evil:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Iomedae worshiper only. Your weapons won&rsquo;t function against anything that has DR higher than 5/, which limits the spell&rsquo;s shelf life considerably.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Winter Feathers:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Tengu only. It&rsquo;s </span><span class="c6">endure elements,</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;but only for cold climates and only for birds. You do the math.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h2 class="c62 c100" id="h.k5iej251wh63"><span class="c24 c104 c35 c109"></span></h2><h2 class="c18" id="h.qrp3mqaepsr0"><span class="c24 c58">2nd-Level Spells</span></h2><p class="c7"><span class="c28 c41 c21">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Anticipate Thoughts:</span><span class="c28 c42">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Insight bonus. On a successful save, you get an excellent defensive buff; on a failed save, you also get a potent offensive buff. Both bonuses get better as rounds progress. Only downsides here are the relatively short duration and the [mind-affecting] tag.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Boneshaker:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;I love this spell. It&#39;s flavorful as hell, the damage scales pretty hard for a 2nd-level spell, and you can use it to abuse AoOs against the undead. Non-intelligent undead don&#39;t even get a save.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c42">Defending Bone:</span><span class="c46">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Pharasma worshiper only. DR against a wide swath of damage types that is never bypassed by enhancement bonuses or special weapon materials, and it lasts for a ridiculously long time. Great defensive spell to keep you on your feet during protracted fights.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Focused Scrutiny:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Untyped bonus. An absolute must for nearly any important social interaction. It even comes with nice perks for demoralize builds.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Ghost Whip:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">Fuck yeah, </span><span class="c6">ghost whip!</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;15-foot range, hits against incorporeals&rsquo; Touch AC, ignores even total cover, impossible to sunder or disarm, and grants free drag, trip, disarm, and reposition maneuvers? I hear sick a guitar riff every time I think about this spell.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Huntmaster&rsquo;s Spear:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Doesn&rsquo;t get much better than a 24-hour duration, and you&rsquo;ll usually have a decent idea of what enemies you&rsquo;ll be facing in a day. Add on the ability to get free </span><span class="c6">bane</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;rounds and pierce any amount of DR on a masterwork spear (with reach!) and you&rsquo;ve got a hell of a package.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Inflict Pain:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Even a successful save leaves an enemy fucked up for one round. It&rsquo;s [mind-affecting] and [pain], so be smart about when you attempt it.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Litany of Duty:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Untyped bonus. Oh, man. Reroll any enchantment spell you&rsquo;ve been subjected to as an immediate action. Incredible.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Mortal Terror:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;The debuffs start nice and get nasty fast, with a chance to reduce anyone failing their saves to a gibbering heap within a few rounds. On a successful save they&rsquo;re shaken for one round, which isn&rsquo;t much by itself, but better than nothing. Definitely a top-shelf spell.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">See Invisibility:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Enemies will go invisible, and that&#39;s a fact.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Silence:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">Excellent for covert ops and brutal against casters, </span><span class="c6">silence</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;has never been a bad pick.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Stricken</span><span class="c16">&nbsp;Heart:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">You&rsquo;ll grow old waiting for that spell crit, but staggered is still a powerful condition that prevents full attacks from melee bruisers and forces casters into an unpleasant choice. And no save, either, which takes it at least to green, possibly to blue, depending on how much time you spend in melee.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Acute Senses:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Enhancement bonus. Acute indeed! Perception is an important roll to make, and this makes you insanely good at it. Pity the duration isn&#39;t longer, or this would be blue.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Blistering Invective:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">You diss someone so hard they literally catch on fire. It&#39;s flavorful, mechanically strong, and a delight to unleash.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Bloodhound:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Competence bonus. The duration is excellent, and adding unusual modes of perception like scent is never a bad idea.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Brand of Hobbling:</span><span class="c28 c21">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Fail a Fort save, cut someone&rsquo;s speed in half (including 5-foot steps) more or less permanently. If you can tag a runner with it, so much the better.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Brow Gasher:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;No-save bleed damage and a progressive debuff that eventually blinds the enemy. I like what I see.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Build Trust:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">The duration is good, the ability to reroll failed CHA-based skill checks is good, and there&#39;s no wording stating that you&#39;re limited to Diplomacy checks. Make sure you&#39;re doing whatever you can to pass those checks, though, because each reroll prompts a new Will save.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Darkness:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;You never know when this might come in handy.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Escaping Ward:</span><span class="c28 c46">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Halfling only. Useful spell for positioning and defense.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Fear the Sun:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">AoE light sensitivity that you can easily turn into a save against blindness with any one of your numerous illumination control spells. Have at ye!</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Guarding Knowledge:</span><span class="c28 c21">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">Insight bonus. A natural synergy with Monster Lore, </span><span class="c6">guarding knowledge</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;will protect you from some of the very worst monster abilities.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Hidden Presence:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Will negates, but suppressing even extraordinary or supernatural senses is quite the selling point.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Honeyed Tongue:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Nice long duration, and best-of-two is a great mechanic, especially if you&#39;re having to be nice to someone for a change.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Inheritor&rsquo;s Smite:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Sacred bonus, Iomedae worshiper only. Uncommon bonus, swift action cast, buff to hit, free bull rush with no AoO...all systems are go.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Invisibility:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Perennially useful.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Mark of Blood:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">The ability to find someone at all times is highly useful.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Perceive Cues:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Competence bonus. Good boost to skills you&#39;re already going to be using a lot. Nice long duration. Stacks with </span><span class="c6">acute senses.</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;All systems are go!</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Protection from [Alignment], Communal:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Pick Good or Evil, whichever your group faces most often, and enjoy.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Psychic Reading:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Even with the chance for some inaccurate information, your Sense Motive skill checks are likely to be sky high, and this is a form of divination that doesn&rsquo;t allow for a save, making it excellent against other casters. Just take what you learn with a grain of salt, including information like alignment.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Resist Energy:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;It scales pretty quickly, and can make tough fights easy when combined with </span><span class="c6 c55">quell energy.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Spiritual Weapon:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">It gets iterative attacks, penetrates DR, hits incorporeal creatures, and can attack an enemy without continued action input from you. It won&#39;t ever be a powerhouse, but free damage is still a win, win, win.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Sun&rsquo;s Disdain:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">Fear the sun </span><span class="c28">is for crowds, but </span><span class="c6">sun&rsquo;s disdain</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;is for solo operators. Permanent light blindness? I&rsquo;ll have what she&rsquo;s having.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Tactical Acumen:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Insight bonus. You&#39;re already a Teamwork feat powerhouse, and feats like Outflank paired with </span><span class="c6">tactical acumen</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;can be powerful indeed.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Tactical Miscalculation:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Enemies with reach and Combat Reflexes will be more than a little put out by this spell. Keep the [mind-affecting] and [emotion] riders in mind.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Voluminous Vocabulary:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">Tongues</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;doesn&#39;t give you the ability to read or write, and this does. Besides, you&#39;ll mostly be using </span><span class="c6">tongues</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;to understand one language you don&#39;t speak, not many.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Weapon of Awe:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Sacred bonus. Excellent pre-combat buff spell.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Bestow Insight:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Insight bonus, human only. It&#39;s good for skill buffing. You&#39;re probably better off saving your 2nd-level slots and using </span><span class="c6">guidance</span><span class="c12">, though. Less effective, but far more efficient.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Detect Magic, Greater:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;It&#39;s a nice upgrade to </span><span class="c6">detect magic,</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;but you probably won&#39;t want to be burning 2nd-level spell slots on it.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Detect Thoughts:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;What are &quot;surface thoughts,&quot; exactly? Who knows? That&#39;s half the fun. Careful using this around BBEGs, as a high enough INT score will stun you.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Diminish Resistance: </span><span class="c12">Fort saves will get sky-high in the later levels, so don&rsquo;t count on landing this. Definitely useful if you manage to, though.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Flames of the Faithful:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">Not the greatest, but some enemies do have fire vulnerabilities. Might be better off hitting them with </span><span class="c6">blistering invective,</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;though.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Hold Person:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Will negates. Probably best off leaving this to the Wizard, since they get a save every round.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Holy Ice Weapon:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Undeniably cool, but holy crap, you have to tote around 5 lbs. of powdered silver?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Hunter&#39;s Lore:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Thanks to the Monster Lore class feature, Inquisitors are pretty good at identifying enemies. This makes you better.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Instrument of Agony:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Morale bonus. The boost to Intimidate isn&#39;t bad if you&#39;ve got a demoralize build, and nauseated is a hell of a condition if you can proc it successfully. Passing that ability through SR, a Will save, and the [mind-affecting] tag will severely limit your target choices, though.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Iron Stake:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Haha, this will fuck up fey and demons pretty badly. Definitely a must-get if you&rsquo;re going up against the denizens of the First World or the Abyss.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Mindshock:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Pairs well with the Enforcer feat. If you don&rsquo;t have that, you might not get much mileage out of </span><span>nonlethal</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;damage, especially since so many immunities (mind-affecting, critical hits, pain effects, etc.) will negate the bonus.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Qualm:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Even if you stick the landing on the Will save, you&rsquo;re effectively just dazing them for a round, which isn&rsquo;t that great.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Quell Energy:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;You still get one round of effect even if the target passes its Will save. Could be effective against dragons, elementals, etc.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Righteous Blood:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Great as a buff spell for a frontline Paladin or Warpriest. If you don&rsquo;t have those on your team, skip.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Rovagug&rsquo;s Fury:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Rovagug worshiper only. No way your trip will succeed against most larger targets, but hordes of minions? Good there.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Savage Maw:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Adding a natural attack is never a bad idea. A free swift action Dazzling Display is icing.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Shadowmind:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Useful for blinding enemies that see in supernatural darkness, pending a save.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Shield Other:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Good tanking spell.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Spell Gauge:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;It&#39;s actually pretty nifty, but many times SLAs are the ones you have to watch out for. Also, a Will save negates. That&#39;s bad news when you&#39;re targeting nothing but casters with it.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Spindrift Spritz:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">The spell&rsquo;s chassis is solid; I think it&rsquo;s more appropriate as a 1st-level spell in terms of power, however, given the low severity of the listed conditions.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Surmount Affliction:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">What </span><span class="c6">soothing word</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;wanted to be.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Tremor Blast:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">This could be nice against large groups of weaker enemies.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Undeath Sense:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Lasts a bit longer, comes out of the gate a bit faster. Modest trade-off with </span><span class="c6 c55">detect undead.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Urgathoa&rsquo;s Beacon:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Strong if you&rsquo;re a necromancer; useless if you&rsquo;re not.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c28 c41 c46">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Align Weapon:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;There&rsquo;s been some discussion as to whether the +2 bonus from the Bane class ability allows Inquisitors to bypass DR/Alignment earlier than other classes. My inclination would be to say yes, but your GM may differ. If the answer is no, </span><span class="c6">align weapon</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;becomes a good wand pick vs. Outsiders, etc.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Brittle Portal:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Rovagug worshiper only. Go ahead and punch your way through that stone wall! The World Ender loves you for your destruction, and creative players will appreciate the possibilities of moving laterally through a dungeon.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Consecrate:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;This is not something you&rsquo;ll be slinging around every day, but keeping a scroll on hand for hallowing unclean sites is an okay idea.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Cure Moderate Wounds: </span><span class="c28">Cure Light is just as good, and the wands are cheaper. You&rsquo;ll be able to wield wands of </span><span class="c6">cure moderate</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;if you find them, though, and that&rsquo;s a boon.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Delay Disease:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Ratfolk only. You could theoretically keep this running permanently, only letting it lapse once you finally heal the underlying condition.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Delay Poison: </span><span class="c12">Nice long duration. Poisons can be no bueno, and this spell will help stave off ability damage until someone can cure it.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Desecrate:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;As </span><span class="c6">consecrate,</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;but for Urgathoan Inquisitors or similar.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Discovery Torch:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Enhancement bonus. It&#39;s a neat little spell, </span><span class="c6">light</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;combined with a few skill bonuses. Duration isn&#39;t bad. Pairs nicely with </span><span class="c6 c55">fear the sun.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Enchantment Sight:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Such a useful spell! People who&rsquo;ve been magically compelled to do something are often the worst kinds of trouble in a campaign, full of backstabbery and sabotage; </span><span class="c6">enchantment sight </span><span class="c28">lets you figure out which enchantment spells are active on anyone in your surroundings, as well as the approximate levels of the spells affecting them. Another strong contender for </span><span class="c6">permanency</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;at 2,500 gp.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Find Traps: </span><span class="c6">Acute senses</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;will work for most applications. </span><span class="c6">Find traps</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;still has its role to play as a scroll, however.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Follow Aura:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Far too narrow for a spell known, but tracking auras is one more reason you&rsquo;re the tracking master.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Garrulous Grin:</span><span class="c19 c37">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">Could find a use or two in an intrigue-heavy campaign. Use with </span><span class="c6">secret sign</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;for extra shenanigans: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been marked as a drug mule using an invisible sign upon his person, my lady, a sign which through my magics I am able to reveal to you. If you question him about it, he is likely to become evasive</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">the final proof of his guilt.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Invisibility Bubble:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">Underwater </span><span class="c6">invisibility.</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;What will those crazy kids at Paizo think up next?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Knock:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Could be useful, but the DCs get quite high. An auto-success would have been better.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Nondetection, Lesser:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Good for general anti-divination use, and without all of the expensive material components. At minutes per level, however, you&rsquo;re not going to be able to screen yourself for any significant portion of the day. Probably best in focused social encounters where you know someone with divination magic might be trying to glean information about you.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Open Book:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Might be useful on a BBEG or other important figure in campaign, but you probably won&#39;t be the one casting it, as it&rsquo;s much better for prepared spellcasters. Will negates.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Remove Paralysis: </span><span class="c12">It&#39;s a nasty condition, so I&rsquo;ll always recommend a scroll or two.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Restoration, Lesser:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Scroll scroll scroll, especially if you don&rsquo;t have two other casters on the team who can cast it.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Rotgut: </span><span class="c12">Good for getting targets drunk, either to coerce/ambush them, or else as a tactic against some groups of humanoids who might be delighted to discover that their water has, by some miracle, turned into wine.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Shackle:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;A scroll if there ever was one. Who knows? You might need to take prisoners at some point.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Spiritual Squire: </span><span class="c12">A longer duration would have been great. Aid another is probably the best use of its actions.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Tongues:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;This spell has always been a good pick. A scroll will do, though.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Undetectable Alignment:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;It&#39;s an okay benefit, but you won&#39;t need it that often. Scroll it.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Whispering Wind:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Tactical communication is always difficult during coordinated operations, but a scroll of </span><span class="c6">whispering wind</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;might alleviate the pain a little.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Zone of Truth: </span><span class="c12">Interrogations do come up, but note that smart enemies will dodge the truth or pass their Will save.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c28 c41 c46">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Abeyance:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Far too limited, can only be used once, doesn&#39;t cure the curse. Pass.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Aid:</span><span class="c28 c46">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">Morale bonus. </span><span class="c6">Bless</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;gives you the same benefit for multiple party members as a 1st-level spell.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Ally Across Time:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">One duplicate won&rsquo;t be helping you out much. We&rsquo;ll wait for </span><span class="c6 c55">army across time.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Beacon of Guilt:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Highly situational spell for when you&rsquo;re trying to catch a thief or something similar.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Bestow Weapon Proficiency:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">One minute per level? Nah.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Billowing Skirt:</span><span class="c28 c46">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">The clothing clause is restrictive, and it&rsquo;s a standard action to cast. Isn&rsquo;t half the point of </span><span class="c6">feather fall</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;that you can use it as an immediate action?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Blessings of Luck and Resolve:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Halfling only. </span><span class="c6">Remove fear</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;does it just as well, and as a 1st-level spell.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Bloodbath:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Generally speaking, it&#39;s not a good idea to deal damage to yourself just to deal damage to enemies.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Bullet Ward:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Even with all things serving the Beam, how often do you face enemy Gunslingers?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Calm Emotions:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Will negates, and concentration is bad.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Castigate:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Why not just demoralize instead?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Conditional Favor:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;I&rsquo;d rather use something like </span><span class="c6">conditional curse</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;or </span><span class="c6">geas</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;to extract good behavior from someone. This is too finicky.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Confess:</span><span class="c28 c46">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">As flavor, it&rsquo;s as inquisitorial as they come; 2d4 sicken is not a great use of a 2nd-level spell slot, however.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Corruption Resistance:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Way too narrow.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Death Candle:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Will negates, and the effect isn&#39;t very strong.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Death Knell:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;See above.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Delay Pain:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Only guards against a few conditions, none of which are life-threatening.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Demand Offering:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s like a Disarm or Steal maneuver in spell form. Probably just as likely to work, too.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Detect Relations:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Really seems like you shouldn&rsquo;t need a spell to figure out whether two people are family.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Disguise Other:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Same issues as </span><span class="c6">disguise self.</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;There are better methods available.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Display Aversion:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">For use against vampires only, who will most likely make their save and realize that it&rsquo;s just a figment.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Distressing Tone:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Blergh. Short duration, limited targets, Fort negates, and you have to spend a full-round action.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Early Judgment:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Flavorful, but mechanically useless.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Effortless Armor:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">If it were hours per level, this would be a hell of a spell. Minutes? Blech.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Enshroud Thoughts:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Too narrow. Hopefully nobody&rsquo;s trying to modify your memory on the regular.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Enthrall:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Will negates, it takes a full round to cast, and you probably have an average CHA score.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Escape Alarm:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Stop right there, criminal scum! Fun but mechanically poor.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Fairness:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Abadar worshiper only. Far too narrow.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Fleshy Facade: </span><span class="c12">NPC spell.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Flickering Lights:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">I mean, this will just fuck shit up and make your team hate you. If you want light, cast </span><span class="c6">daylight.</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;If you want darkness, cast </span><span class="c6">deeper darkness.</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;I don&#39;t know of any group that wants the lighting to randomly switch between supernatural darkness and bright daylight.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Force Anchor:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">I want to love this one</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">it&#39;s so cool. The damage sucks, though, and the debuffs aren&rsquo;t meaty enough for a 2nd-level spell.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Ghostbane Dirge:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">Will negates. Again, better off buying some weapon blanches...or using the </span><span class="c6 c55">GHOST WHIP!</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Ghostly Disguise:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Too narrow.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Haunting Reminder:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Fun as making someone permanently scared of you sounds, is there a mechanical benefit to it? Nah, probably not.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Healing Token:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">You won&rsquo;t really have the spells available to be a dedicated healer. Leave this role to the Cleric.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Hidden Blades:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Way too niche for anyone but a Cloaked Wolf.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Hold Fey:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">See </span><span class="c6">hold person </span><span class="c12">above. This is even more situational.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Howling Agony:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">Yeah, casters are just going to choose the &quot;scream&quot; option and </span><span class="c6">disintegrate</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;you with their remaining standard action.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Improve Trap:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Traps? Nope.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Inflict Moderate Wounds:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Yeah, no. Much better options available.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Inner Focus:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Best for Evil characters who can&rsquo;t reveal their faiths in public.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Instant Weapon:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">Only for melee characters. If you&#39;re getting this for its simulated </span><span class="c6">ghost touch</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;ability, you&#39;re better off just buying some weapon blanches or using the incomparable </span><span class="c6 c55">ghost whip.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Kalistocrat&rsquo;s Nightmare:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">The anti-Midas Touch...and about as useful as that sounds.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Know Peerage:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Wow, what a niche spell. Not for you.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Light Prison:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Iomedae worshiper only. The damage is terrible, and the blind isn&rsquo;t much better, with so many options already available to you.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Litany of Defense:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Duration is faaaar too short. Besides, you need your swift actions.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Magic Siege Engine:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">How often do you use siege engines, again?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Muffle Sound:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Duration is very short, and the spell failure chance will just piss most people off. Only rogues would see much use.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Necrostasis:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">They still have to fail their save, which seems out of character for most undead-specific spells. I&rsquo;d pass.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Protection from Outsiders:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;You have specify type and subtype of outsider, which might get too fine-grained for most adventuring parties.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Quick Change:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Inquisitors can&rsquo;t change shape.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Retributive Reparations:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;About the only thing I&#39;d put this on is a component pouch/divine focus, but you can just buy extras.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Returning Weapon, Communal:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">For when you have an entire group of thrown weapon builds!</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Revealing Light:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Of dubious effectiveness, even against stealthy creatures.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Rumormonger:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Too narrow.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Sacred Bond:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Expensive material components for your level.

YOU ARE THE ONE WHO KNOCKS.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Sense Madness:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Too narrow.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Shamefully Overdressed:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Well, let&#39;s see: it would only be useful against enemies that wear clothing; it can&#39;t be used to remove armor, per the donning rules; there&#39;s no guarantee that they&#39;ll remove a magical piece of attire; and enemies get SR and Will to negate. As a combat spell, it&rsquo;s ridiculously bad. As flavor? You&rsquo;ll never find better.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Shared Suffering:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Please don&rsquo;t plunge a dagger into yourself just to deal some damage.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Shield of Shards:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Even for shield users, the damage is incredibly low and you lose your protection while the spell is active.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Shifted Steps:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">Better off having someone else cast </span><span class="c6 c55">ghost sound.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Soothing Word:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">It would be good if you were under the effects of multiple conditions, but if that&#39;s the case, you&#39;re already toast.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Spellcurse:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Most enemies won&#39;t be buffed this much, and the damage (especially if they pass their Will save) is anemic.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Spiral Descent:</span><span class="c28 c46">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">But you don&rsquo;t get the ascent version? Strange.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Stoke the Inner Fire:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">As you&rsquo;ll see later, the </span><span class="c6">flaming</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;weapon enchantment is as weak as they come.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Telepathic Censure:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Too narrow.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Unholy Ice Weapon:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Unless you&#39;ve been stripped of possessions and imprisoned by Good-aligned outsiders...?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Vexing Miscalculation: </span><span class="c28">Only guards against one critical.

Holy crap, that&rsquo;s good. I don&rsquo;t even care that a Fortitude save negates. The only real fly in the ointment is that you have to be Red Mantis or using a sawtooth sabre, an arrangement that&rsquo;s unlikely for most inquisitors unless they worship Achaekek.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Channel Vigor:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Whoa, whoa, whoa. </span><span class="c6">Haste?</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;+6 to Fort or Will saves? +4 to ranged attack rolls? Switch between effects as a move action?

At minutes per level, you stand a good chance of building up to maximal effect: +5 to hit, +5 damage, and DR 10/</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c28">. </span><span class="c6">Juggernaut&rsquo;s Pauldrons</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;can give you this spell for free three times per day</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">give them some thought if you&rsquo;re playing with Automatic Bonus Progression rules.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Dispel Magic:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Versatile and powerful. Perfect for a spell known.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Forced Mutation:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;-4 to CON is a hit against anyone, and -4 CHA might hinder some casters or feint/demoralize builds as well. Add a free deformity on top of that, and you&rsquo;re looking at a strong spell.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Hunter&#39;s Eye: </span><span class="c28">Competence bonus. Ignore most forms of concealment, functional </span><span class="c6">see invisibility,</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;and a huge boost to Perception, all wrapped up in a nice little package.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Magic Circle vs. [Alignment]:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Deflection and resistance bonuses. Protect the squishy back line or your front line partners for a good duration. </span><span class="c6">Magic circle vs. evil</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;will likely see the most use.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Righteous Vigor:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Morale bonus. Great boost to attack and HP, and can be cast on others in case you&#39;ve got morale bonuses going already.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Second Wind: </span><span class="c28">Emergency swift/immediate action </span><span class="c6">cure moderate wounds</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;when you&rsquo;re below &frac14; HP. Hell. Yes. This might be the only thing standing between you and perma-death in some cases.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Shield of Darkness:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">50% miss chance for rounds/level that beats </span><span class="c6">true seeing</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;and blindsense. You&rsquo;ll still need to worry about tremorsense, blindsight, and scent, but even taking those limitations into account, this is a powerful ability.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Terrible Remorse:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;It&#39;s a pretty brutal spell that&#39;s especially effective at shutting down big bruisers with weak Will saves and high STR. Even better because it staggers and gives a penalty to AC on a successful save!</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Apparent Treachery: </span><span class="c12">No flanking, no buff spells, and targets provoke AoOs from their own erstwhile allies. If you&rsquo;ve got a friend with illusion magic, you could get some serious in-fighting rolling with this spell.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Blinding Ray:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">Dhampir only. </span><span class="c6">Fear the sun </span><span class="c28">or </span><span class="c6">sun&rsquo;s disdain + blinding ray</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;allows you to give a target light sensitivity, then blast them for damage and long-lasting blindness. This targets Fort saves, too, so good against casters.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Burst of Speed:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Untyped bonus. With its ability to ignore AoOs and move you through enemy spaces (not to mention its swift action cast) </span><span class="c6">burst of speed</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;is ideal as a mid-combat positioning tool or substitute for a full-round Withdraw action.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Claim Identity:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Untyped bonus. The duration is excellent, you get a boost to the Disguise check, and nobody will believe the target when he says he&#39;s you. You&#39;re not naturally great at infiltration, Bluff and Disguise not being such important skills for the base Inquisitor, but this would be a good way to do it if you needed to.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Clay Skin: </span><span class="c28">The worst part about </span><span class="c6">stone skin</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;is the material component costs. What if you could still get DR/Adamantine with no material costs, though? That&rsquo;s what </span><span class="c6">clay skin</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;is here for. It won&rsquo;t soak quite as much damage, but 50 damage you don&rsquo;t take is 50 HP you don&rsquo;t have to heal later.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Damnation:</span><span class="c19 c37">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Will only negates half of the damage, and you&#39;re likely to fight a lot of enemies who use Evil spells or SLAs. This one will continue to grow as you level because it&#39;s keyed off of your opponent&#39;s spell levels, not your own.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Daylight:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Necessary for dispelling magical darkness.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Deeper Darkness:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;More tactical options than </span><span class="c6 c55">daylight.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Dimensional Anchor:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Great against those tricksy casters and Outsiders.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Frosthammer: </span><span class="c12">Kostchtchie worshiper only. It&rsquo;s decent damage with no save and a free trip attempt using your CL and WIS modifier instead of CMB and STR. Quite good!</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Heroism:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Morale bonus. I mean, yep, it&#39;s great, no surprises there.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Hide from Undead, Greater: </span><span class="c12">Now the spell doesn&rsquo;t cancel if you attack or cast! For non-intelligent undead, this means death as you cut them apart.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Invisibility Purge:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Help out your martial teammates. Only invisible stalkers are immune.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Keen Edge: </span><span class="c28">Its duration is plenty good, and it saves you some enchantment costs if you don&rsquo;t want to spend the +1 on </span><span class="c6 c55">keen.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Litany of Eloquence: </span><span class="c12">No save, but the duration is only one round and fascinated is a difficult condition to take advantage of directly. Best used as a distraction on a BBEG while you handle a minion or two.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Magic Vestment:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Nice long duration, great effect. If you&rsquo;re playing as a Ravener Hunter with access to some of the armor Revelations, talk to your GM about whether they qualify for </span><span class="c6">magic vestment.</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;They should.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Night of Blades:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Norgorber worshiper only. I love wall spells, no matter the variety.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Nondetection:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;By this level, you&#39;ve probably pissed off a few BBEGs with divination magic, and you don&#39;t want them to know where you are. Good for infiltrating organizations, too.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Penumbral Disguise:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">Competence bonus. Gives a hefty boost to Disguise and Stealth that stacks with </span><span class="c6">adjustable disguise</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;or </span><span class="c6">disguise self</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;in all but bright light. If you&#39;re a sneaky Inquisitor, this is an awesome spell that Rogues would love to poach.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Prayer:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">Luck bonus. Won&#39;t stack with </span><span class="c6">divine favor,</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;but this is still a nice little combo buff/debuff.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Quell Energy: </span><span class="c12">Great debuff against elementals and others that use elemental energies. Even a successful save gives you some protection.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Selective Invisibility:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Hmmm. Issue is that enemies will notice if one of their compatriots just gets up and starts fighting with thin air. Maybe for shrugging off hits while you focus on one big enemy? But if you&rsquo;re going for that, why not use...</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Shield of Fortification, Greater:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Crits and sneak attacks </span><span class="c6">will</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;kill you. This spell gives you the equivalent of a +3 armor enchantment for as long as it&rsquo;s up, so go ahead and take advantage!</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Shield of Wings:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Ragathiel worshiper only. A flight speed plus fire resistance (and eventually immunity) is wicked. Gonna have to play a Ragathite Crimson Templar one of these days!</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Witness:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Nothing says your target has to be human. Excellent for spying, and gives you some meta-knowledge about which senses your target has.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Bloody</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c19 c37">Arrows:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Stackable bleed damage! Nice. Zen Archers and others with crazy amounts of ranged attacks will love you for this buff. Good for self-buffing </span><span class="c28 c21">ranged Inquisitors,</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;obviously.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Cast Out:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Even if the enemy passes the Will save, you still dispel one ongoing enchantment or possession effect. Friends might not thank you for dealing damage to them in order to get the dispel, however.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Coordinated Effort:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Similar to the Tactical Leader archetype&rsquo;s special ability. Quite good, but limited by the fact that you need to be part of any &ldquo;team&rdquo; in order to proc the selected feat.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Daybreak Arrow:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">Another option to consider in the </span><span class="c6">blinding ray/fear the sun/sun&rsquo;s disdain</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;suite of light sensitivity tactics.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Draconic Malice:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Nullifies fear immunity </span><span class="c6">and</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;immunity to mind-affecting conditions...but only for living creatures. Womp womp.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Eldritch Fever:</span><span class="c28 c37">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Disease immunity will stop it outright; however, a single Fort save in return for permanent sickened and constant concentration checks can make a caster&rsquo;s life hell.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Fearsome Duplicate:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Halfling only, competence bonus. You could probably find a use for a larger, more intimidating version of yourself from time to time.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Find Fault:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Insight bonus. You tend to be pretty good at monster identification due to Monster Lore, but archetypes that gave it up will find this useful. The boost to your next attack roll is just gravy.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Halt Undead:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Non-intelligent undead get no save. Not a bad way to take three enemies out of a fight with minimal fuss.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Litany of Order:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Double damage vs. chaotic creatures is ridiculously good; only the Paladins, Warpriests, and Clerics of the party will see any benefit, however.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Litany of Warding:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">I&#39;d sooner pick up Combat Reflexes, but more AoOs never hurts.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Locate Weakness:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;The utility depends on the threat range of your weapon. Could be </span><span class="c28 c21">green</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;for crit-fishing builds.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Magic Weapon, Greater:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Enhancement bonus. Won&#39;t bypass DR, and won&rsquo;t stack with your normal enhancement bonus.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Protection from Energy:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;I prefer </span><span class="c6">resist energy</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;in most circumstances.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Raven&#39;s Flight:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;You&#39;re limited to one turn, but having access to flight is never bad. The main use I would envision for this spell is getting positioned at the start of battle, but </span><span class="c6">burst of speed</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;can probably do it just as well.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Resist Energy, Communal:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Particularly good against enemies with strong elemental affinities, like dragons or elementals.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Stage Fright:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Multiple targets, Will negates. A decent anti-caster tool that Spellbreakers and Witch Hunters should consider.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Adjustable Disguise:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;The ability to change the disguise and a good duration make this a worthier choice than </span><span class="c6">disguise self,</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;but you probably still won&#39;t be doing enough disguising to make this worth a spell known.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Align Weapon, Communal: </span><span class="c12">The duration will last you only one combat, but everyone penetrating DR/Alignment can make for severely foreshortened fights against Outsiders and the like.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Arcane Sight:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;It&#39;s definitely better than </span><span class="c6">detect magic,</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;but one is an orison that you can use at-will, and this is a 3rd-level spell</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">a precious resource. A scroll will probably suffice.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Blood Biography:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;A great quality of life spell that will help you dissect what happened in crime scenes, battlefields, etc.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Cleromancy:</span><span class="c19 c37">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">The full-round cast makes </span><span class="c6">cleromancy</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;an unlikely choice for mid-combat. For skill checks outside of combat, it&rsquo;s quite nice.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Cure Serious Wounds: </span><span class="c12">Again: excellent spell, but any healing you do needs to come from a wand. Your spell slots are for combat and skills.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Detoxify:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Just the slightest bit too niche for a spell known, but still a nice effect.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Gullibility:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Untyped bonus. Some good applications if you&rsquo;re trying to run a con or something similar.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Insect Scouts:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Man, I really like this spell. You get information about joints you&#39;re casing (I still think like a Rogue, even after all these years) and the ability to reroll some saves or skill checks if you fail them in the course of breaking in. It&#39;s probably too situational for a spell known, but a scroll might be handy.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Locate Object:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a fairly weak spell for 3rd level, but hey, you never know.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Planar Inquiry: </span><span class="c12">You&#39;ll be getting an Outsider that&#39;s aligned with your philosophies, hence one that generally wants to help you and not, ya know, slaughter you. Your GM will decide how much meta-information the Outsider is able to furnish, though.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Remove Curse: </span><span class="c28">The cleric will always be better at this, but you should </span><span class="c6">for sure</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;keep a scroll or two handy.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Remove Disease:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;See above.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Retributive Reparations:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Not as a spell known, but quite the pick for a scroll if you&rsquo;re trying to hang onto a McGuffin.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Riversight:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Cool in concept, too narrow in execution for anything but a spell.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Speak with Dead: </span><span class="c12">So they can lie to you, or refuse to answer? Jeez, these guys. Might be useful as a scroll. Occasionally.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Spiral Ascent: </span><span class="c12">Teleporting up is generally more useful than teleporting down.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">They Know:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Every Inquisitor should grab a scroll of </span><span class="c6">they know</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;at some point; it&rsquo;s just too, too flavorful.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Agonizing Rebuke:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Hobgoblin only. [Emotion], [mind-affecting], [pain], SR applies, and Will to negate, all for a little bit of </span><span>nonlethal</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;damage. Blergh.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Anti-Summoning Shield:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Your chances to prevent summoning cap out at 75%.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Aquatic Trail:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Seafaring campaigns only.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Aura of Inviolate Ownership:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Unless your DM is fond of the Steal or Disarm maneuvers, this won&#39;t be of any use.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Banish Seeming:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;It has its uses, but by and large </span><span class="c6">dispel magic</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;will always trump it.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Battle Trance:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Half-orc only. Can&#39;t move away from enemies that attacked you, take INT damage, lose ability to cast spells without passing a concentration check. Hell, no.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Bite the Hand:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Narrow application + Will save = no thanks, Tom Hanks.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Blessing of the Mole: </span><span class="c12">Competence bonus. Most races have darkvision already, and the Stealth bonus certainly isn&rsquo;t taking home any prizes.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Blood of the Martyr:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Gross as hell and not mechanically strong. You have </span><span class="c6">cure light wounds,</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;others have </span><span class="c6 c55">infernal healing.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Blood Scent:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Orc only. You have </span><span class="c6">bloodhound,</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;which gives you scent as a 2nd-level spell. Pass.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Continual Flame:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">Light</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;or an ioun torch will serve for normal visibility purposes, and you&rsquo;ll want something like </span><span class="c6">daylight</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;to dispel magical darkness.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Countless Eyes:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Useful for the tanks in the party; leave it for a full caster, though.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Delay Poison, Communal:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">Delay poison</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;is nice because you can delay for a long time; if you split up the duration, everyone will wind up getting poisoned.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Detect Anxieties:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Long cast time, Will negates, risk getting stunned, mechanically weak...but what flavor!</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Detect Desires:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Same basic problems and flavorful eccentricities as above.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Disrupt Link:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;If you&#39;re focusing on taking out the familiar or animal companion instead of its bonded Wizard or Druid, you&#39;re focusing on the wrong thing.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Disrupt Silence:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Too narrow.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Divine Illumination:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">You can&#39;t channel.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Domination Link:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;If vampires are the main targets in your campaign, pick it up. If not, don&rsquo;t.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">False Alibi:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Norgorber worshiper only. Highly, highly situational, and without a doubt an evil spell to cast.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Fester:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Far too limited in scope. Most monsters with fast healing or regeneration also have ways to stop that regeneration.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Flexile Curse:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Fortunately for your wealth by level, the broken conditions eventually go away (unlike Sundering or something similar) but when are you going to have hours to wait while an enemy&#39;s armor degrades?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Free Swim:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Good if your campaign is aquatic, bad if not. You know the drill by now.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Full Pouch:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Alchemical items are cheap, and this is way too weak for a 3rd-level spell. 1st-level, maybe.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Glimpse the Hidden:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Strictly inferior to </span><span class="c6 c55">see invisibility.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Glyph of Warding:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Not for a spell known. A Wizard might prepare this while fortifying an area, but you need something that you could reliably use every day.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Guardian Monument, Lesser:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Again, a cool spell for a Wizard to reward a village with, but not for you.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Hidden Speech:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Too niche for a spell known.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Holy Javelin:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Low damage, short duration, and minimal effort for opponents to remove the javelin. Pass.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Horrifying Visage:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Best case, enemies get the sickened condition under restricted circumstances. Not worth it to me.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Improve Trap:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Kobold only. An NPC spell.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Inflict Serious Wounds:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Bleh. Just attack.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Instant Fake:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;More suited to Arcane Tricksters.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Isolate:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Most enemies later on will be able to see invisibility, hence will be immune to the effects of this spell.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Light of Iomedae:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Iomedae worshiper only. The best application is as an anti-invisibility tool, but you already have </span><span class="c6">see invisibility</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c6">invisibility purge.</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;This only affects undead, so I&rsquo;d let it go.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Lightning Lash:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Measly damage, with a Fort save negating what little there is. The image is cool, but nah.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Litany of Entanglement:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Will negates, and won&#39;t work on flying creatures, which get more common as levels progress.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Litany of Righteousness:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;You don&#39;t have an aura.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Mantle of Calm:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;I don&#39;t care if everyone&#39;s raging, you don&#39;t want to take a -2 hit to attack while giving them +2 to all saves.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Meticulous Match:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Way too narrow. Another prepared spell.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Miasmal Dread:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Half-orc only. Why are you not using Dazzling Display instead? Why waste a 3rd-level spell?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Mythic Severance: </span><span class="c12">Anyone with mythic power is going to beat your save DC. Skip.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Obscure Object:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Too narrow.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Pack Empathy:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">You&#39;ve got better ways to do a sit rep than this.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Pillow Talk: </span><span class="c12">A lot of potential downside here, with not a lot of upside in sight.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Reaper&#39;s Coterie:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">Profane bonus. The bonus type is hard to come by, but at rounds/level, how much of a boost do you expect to get? You can&#39;t kill fast enough to rack up anything decent. Get </span><span class="c6">deadly juggernaut</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;instead</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">that lasts minutes per level.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Respectful Quiet:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Chelaxian only. I&rsquo;d stick with </span><span class="c6 c55">silence.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Retribution:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">Inflict pain</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;does it just as well</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c28">if not better</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">as a 2nd-level spell.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Sadomasochism:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Zon-Kuthon worshiper only. Don&#39;t take damage to demoralize. Just demoralize.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Searing Light:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;At the level you get this, on average you&#39;ll be dealing 13-18 damage with it. For reference, many CR 7 undead in the Bestiary have 75+ HP. Not worth it.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Seek Thoughts:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">Slightly better than </span><span class="c6">detect thoughts,</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;but still not great for a 3rd-level spell.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Selective Alarm:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">Why not use </span><span class="c6 c55">alarm?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Slave to Sin:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Worst case scenario for an enemy is sickened and staggered. We&rsquo;re starting to get into the higher levels, where we need to ask more of our spells.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Soul Vault: </span><span class="c12">Far too niche.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Spotlight:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;I think you&#39;ve got better ways to exploit light sensitivity, and the main guys you&#39;ll try to be tagging with this (stealthy, invisible, etc.) will probably pass a Reflex save.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Stunning Barrier, Greater:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;You&#39;ve got </span><span class="c6">magic circle.</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Stop trying to get hit!</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Sweat Poison:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Grippli only. Puny Fort save DC.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Trial By Fire:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;If you&#39;re trying to deal damage, there are better ways; if you&#39;re trying to demoralize, there are better ways.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Unhallowed Blows, Greater: </span><span class="c12">You&rsquo;re not undead, I think?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Wall of Split Illumination:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">If you could see through the wall, this spell would be blue. If the wall stopped movement through it, this spell would be blue. As is, it provides no tactical advantage beyond forcing enemies to spend a move action getting onto your side of the wall.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Ward the Faithful:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">Magic circle</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;has a smaller bonus, but includes everybody, even the heretics.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Winged Weapon:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Don&#39;t need no stinking throwing weapons.</span></p><p class="c103 c9"><span class="c24 c68"></span></p><h2 class="c62" id="h.82o3hl8wjal"><span class="c24 c104 c35 c109">&nbsp;</span></h2><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h2 class="c62 c100" id="h.ng8o7z5wtzx7"><span class="c24 c104 c35 c109"></span></h2><h2 class="c18" id="h.ef8jjyxq9sfp"><span class="c24 c58">4th-Level Spells</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c28 c41 c46">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Army Across Time:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Much, much better than its little brother. You&rsquo;re the teamwork feat master, and this spell gives you the ability to abuse that mastery to no end. All the Aid Other actions will help, as well.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Beacon of Luck:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Sacred bonus, Desna worshiper only. +2 to all saves is worth the price of admission on its own. An uncommon bonus type and giving allies rerolls on saves pushes this spell well into the blue zone.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Blade of Light:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Sacred bonus. To-hit buffs, free </span><span class="c6">daylight</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c6">ghost touch,</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;automatic confirmations against sunlight-vulnerable enemies, extra damage...the benefits of this spell just keep on rolling. Definitely an &ldquo;I win&rdquo; button for melee Inquisitors when facing undead of any kind.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Divine Power:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Luck bonus. Strictly better than </span><span class="c6">divine favor</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;(by a wide margin) but won&#39;t stack with it. Learn both, in case one level of spell slot is in higher demand that day. Fate&rsquo;s Favored is a tacky trait choice in my opinion, but it will improve this spell noticeably.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Enchantment Foil:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Untyped bonus. With a metamagic rod of Extend Spell, this can easily last all day. As I say continuously, enchantment effects are some of the worst in the game; the ability to bluff your way into making the enemy caster think that they own you is gravy.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Freedom of Movement:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Perennially excellent. This spell is the reason people love the Liberation domain so much.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Judgment Light:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Fantastic spell. You can put out the Judgments whose effects you want, use </span><span class="c6">judgment light,</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;then switch Judgments as a swift action next turn if you want a different active Judgment.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Smite Abomination:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Untyped bonus, Pharasma worshiper only. Whooooa! Free Smite against any one Undead creature, using your WIS bonus instead of CHA? What sorcery is this?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Thaumaturgic Circle:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">Magic circle&rsquo;s</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;older cousin, and good for a variety of planar adventures. I like that you get to pick which elemental affinity or Outsider race you&rsquo;re protecting against as you cast it</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">versatility is exactly what Inquisitors need from a spell.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Undeath Ward:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Keeps non-intelligent undead and intelligent undead with fewer HD out, no save. A great &ldquo;oh shit&rdquo; button in cases of emergency, or else a phenomenal protective tool for ranged Inquisitors.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Battlemind Link:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Pretty good even for regular Inquisitors; probably </span><span class="c28 c42">blue</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;for Sacred Huntsmasters.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Brightest Light:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Good for dispelling darkness</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">what more needs to be said?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Cleansing Fire: </span><span class="c28">Don&rsquo;t come here for the damage, because it&rsquo;s meager. What&rsquo;s good about this spell is the constant, pulsing </span><span class="c6">dispel magic</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;on [evil] effects. Great for stripping enemies of buffs or shutting down nasty necromancy spells as they&rsquo;re cast.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Cold Iron Fetters:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s obviously OP against fey and demons, but it&rsquo;s also versatile enough to shine against larger, slower enemies or flying enemies. Watch out, though, because any GM worth their salt will try to sunder the shackles and have done.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Conditional Curse:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">Bestow curse</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;is powerful, and </span><span class="c6">conditional curse</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;is still just as good. After all, you can set just about any condition you want, as long as it doesn&#39;t ensure death. Highly hazardous to life and limb? Sure. Few things apart from &quot;spend a full week swimming in an active volcano&quot; ensure death, so you&#39;ve got a lot of leeway here.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Coward&#39;s Lament:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Trivializes spellcasters and ranged enemies.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Death Ward:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Undead and their ability drain can go get stuffed.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Denounce:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Oh, but I love the flavor of this spell. You can use it to cause infighting during combat, or to turn the tide of a social encounter in your favor.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Fear:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;You still get the equivalent of a successful Dazzling Display even if enemies pass their saves. If they fail, well, panicked is a terrific debuff condition.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Fleshworm Infestation:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Wow, gross. This will shut down casters and fast movers pretty quickly.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Forceful Strike:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Extra DR-penetrating force damage, free bull rush with a hefty bonus, made as part of a full attack...good stuff.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Invisibility, Greater:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Excellent for combat, and </span><span class="c28 c42">blue</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;for an Inquisitor with </span><span>sneak attack</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;dice. If you&rsquo;re just after the miss chance from concealment, remember </span><span class="c6">shield of darkness</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;from earlier levels.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Litany of Escape:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;As a swift action, save your friend from being pinned or swallowed whole. Worth my money.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Named Bullet:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">Obviously </span><span class="c28 c42">blue</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;for ranged builds, </span><span class="c6">named bullet</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;lets you go nova with a guaranteed critical on the first round of combat. Great even for melee Inquisitors if they have the time to pre-buff.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Protection from Energy, Communal:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Monster Lore will let you identify which element an enemy is liable to use. The shortened duration isn&rsquo;t an issue, because you&rsquo;ll only use this spell to make it past a hard fight or elemental hazard.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Shared Wrath:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Morale bonus. </span><span class="c6">Wrath</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;is good. Give it to your friends!</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Stoneskin:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;It&#39;s powerful indeed, but features an expensive material component. I&rsquo;d keep </span><span class="c6">clay skin</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;around for most workhorse uses, then bust out </span><span class="c6">stoneskin</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;for truly difficult fights.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Transplant Visage:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;&quot;Three lives were owed to the Many-Faced God. A debt must be paid, girl...&quot; Holy crap, it&#39;s the Faceless Men spell! Obviously evil to use, but what flavor...</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Awaken the Devoured: </span><span class="c12">I doubt you&rsquo;ll pass the Will save often, but if you do, the damage scales pretty well and bestowing the confused condition for rounds per level will straight-up end encounters. Even affects multiple enemies. Your enemies have to be daemons, however, so probably only useful as a spell known in campaigns like Wrath of the Righteous.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Brand, Greater:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Making an enemy permanently sickened whenever they&#39;re within 30 ft. of you is pretty cool, especially if you&rsquo;re doing a &ldquo;trust but verify&rdquo; and expect that you might run into an enemy again.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Deathless:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Ideal for casting on party members with the Diehard feat. If no one has that, I&rsquo;d probably skip the spell.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Flash Forward:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Inquisitors of Gorum will find a lot to like with their deity&rsquo;s Divine Fighting Technique and this spell. Too bad you still have to act as if charging, though</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">that opens up a lot of issues with difficult terrain, conditions like blindness that might be affecting you, etc.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Geas, Lesser:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;7 HD limit isn&#39;t ideal, and Will negates; even so, there are some powerful things you could do with this spell.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Glimpse of Truth:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;You can do some worthwhile things with this spell</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c28">tag an invisible enemy, spot an illusion, discover a magically concealed door</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">but it&#39;s hard to parlay into combat effectiveness.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Holy Smite:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;It&#39;s got a similar problem as the other alignment-based nukes you get this level (i.e., nuking your teammates as well as your foes) but at least you&#39;ll probably be fighting many more Evil enemies than Lawful, Chaotic, or Good enemies.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Leashed Shackles:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">The rare Reflex save! Casters will dispel it, which stinks, and you might not be able to hit the faster foes to entangle them in the first place. If it&#39;s got a use, it&#39;s on the big bad bruiser, who will remain entangled even if he destroys the anchor point.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Mark of the Reptile God:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">The best use is a quick and dirty -2 to an enemy&rsquo;s saves on a ranged touch attack. Treat any CHA damage you get as a happy coincidence.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Order&#39;s Wrath:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Same issue as the other alignment-nuking spells in 4th level.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Sphere of Warding:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;I like that possession effects simply end without a save. Maybe worth a look in undead-heavy campaigns.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Tough Crowd:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Insight bonus. Duration&#39;s good, skill bonuses are good. Only gives a boost to one save, though, so it seems a little underwhelming for a 4th-level spell.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3 c41">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Aerial Tracks:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Likely won&#39;t come up enough to be worth a spell known.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Aura Sight:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">Detect [Alignment]</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;will work just as well for most adventuring purposes. If you wanted to, however, the 7,500 gp price tag is well worth it to have constant </span><span class="c6">aura sight</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;running.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Brand of Tracking:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;High-level casters will still have plenty of tools to foil your tracking. It&rsquo;s thematic and unique to Inquisitors (good as an intimidation tactic!) but I&rsquo;d leave this kind of thing to Wizards and the like at this level.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Crusader&#39;s Edge:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;The duration is much better than your Bane, so it might be worth getting a scroll if you anticipate facing a lot of evil Outsiders. Probably not a good spell known outside of Outsider-centric campaigns, though.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Cure Critical Wounds:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Again, you need to spend your resources on wands of </span><span class="c6">cure light wounds,</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;as they&rsquo;re the most reliable, cost-effective, and alignment-neutral means of healing in Pathfinder.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Curse of the Outcast:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">Curse of the outcast + brand of conformity =</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;One permanently fucked up life. Good in intrigue-heavy games or against enemy Bards.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Deceitful Veneer:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Another intrigue spell.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Divination:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;As with </span><span class="c6">planar inquiry,</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;how much you actually benefit from a successful casting will depend on what meta-information your GM is willing to give up.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Dungeonsight:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Similar to </span><span class="c6">insect scouts,</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;and a similarly good candidate for a scroll.

I&rsquo;d still leave it to a full caster, if possible.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Restoration:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;It&#39;s got expensive material components. Probably best to leave to the Cleric of the group unless you&rsquo;re playing as a backup healer.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Sending:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;As teleportation, planar shifts, and other shenanigans begin getting more common in later levels, you should have something to contact lost team members.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Ardor&#39;s Onslaught:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;The text doesn&#39;t specify that you hit only enemies, just &quot;neutral creatures.&quot; This will probably make it a big no-no in most groups.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Ban Corruption:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Even if your GM wants to use the corruption rules, this still requires concentration, and Will negates.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Blightburn Weapon:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Hurts you, too. Pass.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Burst of Glory:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Sacred bonus. I dunno, I&rsquo;m just not excited about it: the radius is small, the bonus is small, the temporary HP are small, and the light isn&rsquo;t anything you couldn&rsquo;t already do with a cantrip. As a 1st-level spell, this would be something to get excited about. As a 4th-level spell? No.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Chaos Hammer:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Same issue as </span><span class="c6 c55">ardor&#39;s onslaught.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Charon&rsquo;s Dispensation: </span><span class="c12">Far too niche. How often do you come into contact with the River Styx in Pathfinder?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Curse of Magic Negation:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Will negates, and the spellblight itself isn&#39;t too good. Casters who fumble their spell don&#39;t lose the slot, and the check to beat their SR never gets too difficult.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Daze, Mass:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;This spell is somehow even worse than </span><span class="c6">daze</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;because...well, who in their right mind would use a 4th-level spell slot to cause a group of humanoids with 4 HD or less to lose one turn?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Death Knell Aura:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;This spell makes it easier to get off a </span><span class="c6">death knell,</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;but the effect is far too weak at this level to be worth it. Plus, successive </span><span class="c6">death knell</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;castings don&rsquo;t stack</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">the bonuses come from the same source.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Defile Armor:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">Magic vestment</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;will serve you better in the end.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Detect Scrying:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Knowing when an enemy is scrying you is useful information, and the duration is permanent right off the bat; however, your spells known are limited. Let the Wizard take care of anti-divination duty.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Discern Lies:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;This is part of your Inquisitor package already. If you traded it away, just rely on Sense Motive instead.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Dismissal:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Most powerful planar entities will beat the save or have a way to return back to your current plane when dismissed. Again, best for full casters.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Forced Repentance:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;You have better ways of shutting down a single enemy.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Harvest Knowledge:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;An evil Psychic who knows everything about the world because she&rsquo;s been slowly bottling up souls and using this spell on their receptacles: devious. Not great for PCs, though.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Healing Warmth: </span><span class="c12">Maximum 5d8 healing. Just use your wand.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Hold Monster:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Enemies get a save every round, and it only affects living creatures. You&rsquo;ll never stick this on someone for long, if at all.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Hollow Heroism:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;I mean, you wouldn&#39;t ever </span><span class="c6">have</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;to utter the keyword, enabling you to use this spell as a normal </span><span class="c6">heroism.</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;The circumstances where you could betray someone with it are limited.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Inflict Critical Wounds:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;No, no, no. Still no. DROP IT.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Interrogation, Greater:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;It&#39;s...still bad.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Litany of Admonition:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;I thought the point of the Litany spells was to give you a one-round debuff with no save? This allows a Fort save but still only gives you a single round of debuff. Useless.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Litany of Dependability: </span><span class="c12">Many enemies pass their checks on average rolls. Not much of a debuff, is it?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Litany of Sight:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">Glimpse of truth</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;gives you </span><span class="c6">true seeing</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;for one round as a 4th-level spell, and </span><span class="c6">see invisibility</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;is a 2nd-level spell. Why does this spell exist?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Magic Siege Engine, Greater:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Uh...?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Peacebond, Greater:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Not much better than Peacebond. Enemies fearsome enough that you&#39;d want to remove their weapons are probably strong enough to pass a STR check with flying colors, not to mention that manufactured weapons get rarer as you level.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Perceive Betrayal: </span><span class="c12">Truly dangerous plotters are likely to have made themselves immune to thought detection, rendering this spell irrelevant in most cases.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Persistent Vigor:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;The duration is too short to give you much healing or protection against conditions.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Planeslayer&#39;s Call:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Meh, a minor boost to CL isn&rsquo;t worth it. Casters will be smart enough not to cast fire spells at fire creatures, too.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Probe History:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Not demonstrably better than making a Knowledge check.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Quieting Weapons:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">Silence</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;is better for ambushes.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Rebuke:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;The damage is laughable for this level, and it&rsquo;s Fort for half. The spell gets better if you&#39;re fighting worshipers of the same god, but how often do you expect to be doing that?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Red Hand of the Killer:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Will negates, the hand can be covered, and anyway, it&#39;s waaaaaay too narrow for spells known.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Remove Radioactivity:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Too niche except in Fallout-style games.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Reprobation:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Spells targeting members of your own faith again.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Rune of Ruin:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;You&#39;re destroying the usefulness of your own loot.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Sanctify Armor:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">Magic vestment</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;will do this just as well.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Sessile Spirit:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Okay in occult games, but nowhere else.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Shadow Barbs:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Actively hurts you.

Useless unless your team uses the rules for forced marching.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Unholy Blight:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;The last of the alignment nuke spells in your arsenal, and also the least likely to be used in most campaigns.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Ward Shield:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Doesn&#39;t work against many spells, and most Inquisitors won&#39;t be using shields anyway.</span></p><p class="c103 c9"><span class="c24 c68"></span></p><h2 class="c62" id="h.sxl6nxxauvf5"><span class="c24 c104 c35 c109">&nbsp;</span></h2><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h2 class="c62 c100" id="h.z73rlfqg05yn"><span class="c24 c104 c35 c109"></span></h2><h2 class="c18" id="h.khobj5601ath"><span class="c24 c58">5th-Level Spells</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c20 c28">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Dimensional Blade:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;You know how Gunslingers are super deadly because they can target ranged touch AC? Yeah, this spell lets melee folk do that for a round. </span><span class="c6">Dimensional blade</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;will let you cut through certain enemies like butter, especially with iterative attacks. Against enemies that use mostly DEX or spells for AC, it won&#39;t do much; fortunately, touch AC tends to be the lowest of the ACs as you go up in level because of the predominance of oversized enemies. If you&#39;re anticipating only making one attack, </span><span class="c6">true strike</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;is probably better.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Disrupting Weapon:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;The usual caveat about Inquisitor DCs not being all that high applies, but you&#39;re still going to be forcing a lot of saves on your hapless undead friends. No SR, either!</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Heretic&rsquo;s Tongue:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Geryon worshiper only. Absolutely incredible anti-caster tool, with some AoE crowd control effects, too. Pity about the faith restriction.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Righteous Might: </span><span class="c6">Inuk chuk!</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;DR 10/Alignment, a size increase, and stat bonuses for rounds per level? Where do I sign?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Wall of Silver:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;One of the very, very few battlefield control powers that Inquisitors get, and consequently highly valuable. The damage and debuffs for evil creatures get downright nasty, and the wall blocks [evil] spells entirely. Great stuff.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Banishment:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Again, the DC is never going to be as high as a Cleric&#39;s, but the option to add to it if you&#39;ve done your homework is a nice touch.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Break Enchantment:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">Dispel magic</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;will suffice in a majority of situations, but when it doesn&#39;t, there&#39;s </span><span class="c6 c55">break enchantment.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Divine Pursuit:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Inquisitors don&rsquo;t get many movement buffs on their spell list, so this spell is valuable. Don&rsquo;t go haring off on your own, though, unless you feel like dying.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Forbid Action, Greater:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Its little brother is kind of a stinker, but this is actually quite good because enemies don&#39;t get repeated saves in future rounds; if they fail that Will save, they&#39;re going to be stuck not attacking or casting for 13+ rounds.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Foster Hatred:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Fomenting riots, playing enemy groups off of each other, destroying friendships through prejudice</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">you&rsquo;ve got a lot of opportunities for creativity with this spell.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Freedom&rsquo;s Toast:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Cayden Cailean worshiper only. </span><span class="c6">Freedom of movement</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;will probably do the job just as well, but it&rsquo;s undoubtedly fun. Get your mate out of the clink with the power of alcohol!</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Hunter&rsquo;s Blessing:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;All-day Favored Terrain and Favored Enemy. The spell never scales past +2, but with the ability to swap out your enemies and terrains every day, I&rsquo;d say you&rsquo;re still getting a deal.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Lend Greater Judgment:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;That&#39;s a potent buff for a friend, but remember that they lose the benefit if you swap Judgments midway through combat. Obviously useless if you traded away Judgment to an archetype.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Spell Resistance:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Remember that SR makes it difficult for allies to target you with spells, too, although you can always choose to lower your SR for your own spells.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Stoneskin, Communal:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Still just as expensive as </span><span class="c6">stoneskin.</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Ideal for boss fights only.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Sun&rsquo;s Disdain, Mass:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Mass blinding is a great tactic. Honorable mention goes to </span><span class="c6">mass sun&rsquo;s disdain + blade of light</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;for instant crit confirmations.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Telepathic Bond:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;What </span><span class="c6">sending</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;wanted to be. Perfect for scouting and tactical coordination.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">True Seeing:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Of course </span><span class="c6">true seeing</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;is powerful</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c28">the question is whether you want to spend on the material cost. Remember that you&#39;ve got </span><span class="c6">glimpse of truth</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;as a 4th-level spell if you just need the effect for a moment, although the cost effectiveness of GP/duration is in </span><span class="c6">true seeing&#39;s</span><span class="c12">&nbsp; favor.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c20 c19">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Alaznist&rsquo;s Jinx:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Magehunters will probably love this spell, especially with some means of tanking an enemy&rsquo;s saves or feats like Disruptive that make defensive casting harder. For most, the save DC just won&rsquo;t be reliable enough against enemy casters.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Chains of Light:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;CR 13 creatures have Reflex saves that usually run in the 8-12 range, which means that most creatures at that CR will make the save around 50% of the time (DC 10 + 5th-level spell + WIS modifier of +5, as an example). That&#39;s not great, especially since they get a save every round, but paralyzed is a powerful condition, and the ban on extradimensional travel is icing. If you&#39;ve got ways to boost your DCs or cripple an enemy&#39;s saves (Touch of Madness from the Madness Domain or the Spell Bane feat, for example) this probably goes to </span><span class="c28 c21">green</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;or even </span><span class="c28 c41 c42">blue.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Decapitation:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Bumping up the critical modifier and damage is nice, but it only works with slashing weapons. If you&#39;re running a slashing weapon build, it deserves some consideration.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Geas/Quest:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">No combat utility due to the casting time, but otherwise as powerful as </span><span class="c6">lesser geas.</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;I prefer </span><span class="c6">conditional curse</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;in most scenarios.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Litany of Thunder:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Fort negates. Might be good on casters, though, who definitely care about being deafened.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Litany of</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c19 c37">Vengeance:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Sacred/profane bonus. A good &quot;focus fire&quot; spell, if you can coordinate your team for a round. </span><span class="c28 c21">Green</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;if you traded away your Judgments</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">Justice doesn&#39;t stack with this.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Atonement:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Thematic yet extraordinarily expensive.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Commune:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Relies on the GM&#39;s goodwill; has an expensive material component and long casting time.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Hallow:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Clerics will probably do this better, but a scroll is okay for you, too.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Mark of Justice:</span><span class="c28 c46">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">Maybe as a scroll? The only benefit this has over </span><span class="c6">conditional curse</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;is forcing compliance out of someone.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Unhallow:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Same as for </span><span class="c6 c55">hallow.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Banishing Blade:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Bull rush isn&#39;t a great maneuver at this stage in the game. You&#39;ve got better tools for dealing with Outsiders.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Blood Ties:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Wow. Evil, evil, evil. Also way too narrow. This is probably an NPC spell.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Castigate, Mass:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Fear and mind-affecting immunities are starting to become extraordinarily common by this level, as are high Will saves. You won&rsquo;t get any significant mileage out of it.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Claim Identity, Greater:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;It&#39;s got a component cost and isn&#39;t appreciably better than </span><span class="c6">claim identity.</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;If you&#39;re stealing someone&#39;s identity, you&#39;re probably knocking them out or otherwise rendering them helpless anyway</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">you don&#39;t need to tote them around as a porcelain mask.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Command, Greater:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Still has limited commands and an overreliance on failed Will saves.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Compelling Rant:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;A spell to be used by NPC cult leaders, etc. You certainly don&rsquo;t want to take any kind of WIS damage voluntarily.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Cure Light Wounds, Mass:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Bad, bad, bad.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Dispel Balance:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">You&#39;ve already got a number of deflection bonuses up and running, and they won&#39;t stack.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Dispel [Alignment]:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">You have </span><span class="c6">banishment, dispel magic,</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c6">break enchantment,</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;all of which are better and more versatile than these spells.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Flame Strike:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;I&rsquo;m begging you, don&rsquo;t blast.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Ghostbane Dirge, Mass:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;I&#39;m not saying you&#39;ll never fight a group of incorporeal enemies, but is it worth a 5th-level spell known when you have such easy access to </span><span class="c6">ghost touch</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;weapons or spells?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Guardian Monument, Greater:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;DR 4/magic isn&rsquo;t even a speed bump to enemies at this level.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Inflict Light Wounds, Mass</span><span class="c28 c46">:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Incredibly, this is even worse than </span><span class="c6 c55">mass cure light wounds.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Mage&#39;s Decree:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;It&#39;s better than </span><span class="c6">sending,</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;but you still probably won&#39;t want to spend a spell known on it.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Profane Nimbus:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;It&#39;s a paltry amount of damage for this level.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Resounding Blow:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Puny damage, Fort negates.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Sabotage Construct:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;It&#39;s limited in scope, but a successful Will save still leaves the construct confused for one round. A scroll would be perfect.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Sacred Nimbus:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Slightly better than </span><span class="c6">profane nimbus</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;due to the number of Evil enemies you&#39;ll be fighting in most campaigns, but still a poor choice overall.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Shroud of Darkness:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">Shadowmind</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;isn&rsquo;t a great spell, and this is basically </span><span class="c6 c55">mass shadowmind.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Soulswitch:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Most Inquisitors won&rsquo;t have familiars, and even if you do, what&rsquo;s the mechanical point here?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Spell Immunity, Communal:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Same issue as</span><span class="c6 c55">&nbsp;spell immunity.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Unwilling Shield:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">250 GP for rounds per level.

You get some soft cover, and enemies still take half damage on a successful Reflex save to pass through the wall.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Dispel Magic, Greater:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Just as versatile as its little cousin.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Heal:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Ah! Finally, a good healing spell, right at the end. Just a flat 150, every time. Works wonders, and can be used as an undead nuke if necessary.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Inspiring Recovery:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Morale bonus. Your one and only resurrection spell, and it&rsquo;s a good one for mid-combat: heal, buff, and resurrection rolled into one.

Even the powers for mediocre domains appear to be really good, so have fun, go nuts.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Named Bullet, Greater:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Still fantastic.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Unshakeable Zeal:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Morale bonus. Failing is something we do quite often in Pathfinder, thanks to the vicissitudes of the d20. Getting a +4 bonus to any check you failed for hours per level is an amazing perk that you&rsquo;ll want to have running on yourself every day.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Bite the Hand, Mass:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Summons are deadly at this level. Even a few turned against their masters can be enough to drastically turn the tide of battle.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Emblem of Greed:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;In addition to being able to turn very innocuous, non-threatening weapons (e.g., masterwork daggers) into a very conspicuous, threatening weapon (+3 </span><span class="c6">spell-storing flaming burst</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;glaive) you also use your caster level for your BAB, giving you a fourth iterative and better chances to hit. Very choice.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Neutralize Poison, Greater:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Insta-win against poisons and any effects thereof. Strike those from your &ldquo;things that worry me&rdquo; list.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Overwhelming Presence:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;They get a Will save every round, but if they recover early they get hit with some big penalties, and even a successful save staggers for one round. Definitely one of your better offensive 6th-level spells.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Rotting Alliance:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Ho ho ho. Positively wrecks groups of enemies, if given an opportunity to work for you over a few days. 1d6 CHA and CON damage is quite nice on the front end, too, although the usual caveats about save DCs at higher levels apply.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Umbral Strike:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Good damage that ignores concealment and potentially renders the victim blind for the whole encounter. Rough against casters.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Unconscious Agenda:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;BWAAAAMP. BWAAAAMP. That&#39;s right, you can now incept people! I like it</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">there are so many opportunities for screwing with politics and intrigue with this spell. When you cast it depends on how your GM approaches the question of whether people know when they&rsquo;ve failed a Will save.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c20 c19">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Artificer&#39;s Curse:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Depends on how frequently you run into magical items</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">at this level, plenty of enemies can wipe the floor with you with no aid.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Blessings of Luck and Resolve, Mass:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Morale bonus, Halfling only. If it&rsquo;s for the whole party, this spell is starting to become more worthwhile. </span><span class="c6">Heroes&rsquo; feast</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;is generally superior if you have the time to eat every day.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Heroes&#39; Feast:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Morale bonus. Not a bad package of buffs to start a day of adventuring with, but you&#39;re unlikely to want to cast it all the time. It says &quot;every creature partaking of the feast is cured of all sickness and nausea, and receives the benefits of both </span><span class="c6">neutralize poison</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c6">remove disease</span><span class="c28">,&quot; which I would take to mean that you don&#39;t have to have the entire feast to get those benefits, just &quot;partake&quot; for a few bites. If many people in your party are poisoned or diseased, it&#39;s definitely worth it</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c28">and if you&#39;re running </span><span class="c6">keep watch,</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;you can afford to feast every day. The bonuses vs. fear and poison are quite good.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Holy Word:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Probably the only nuke spell worth getting, but I still wouldn&#39;t recommend it if you&#39;ve got non-Good party members.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Litany of Madness:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;You get at least one round of confusion, which is good. Don&#39;t count on it giving you more than that, though.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Vision of Lamashtu:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Not actually restricted to Lamashtu worshipers, although it&rsquo;s most certainly evil. Your compulsion (</span><span class="c6">geas</span><span class="c28">) and curse (</span><span class="c6">conditional curse</span><span class="c12">) spells are the best riders for this ability, as their range makes them difficult to pull off in combat.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Find the Path:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;It&#39;ll get you out of </span><span class="c6">maze,</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;which is a brutal spell. It&#39;s also handy for general navigation.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Knock, Mass:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;A scroll, not a spell known.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Lost Legacy: </span><span class="c12">What a way to wreck someone&#39;s life. Not much mechanical use, like many of the more flavorful curses on the Inquisitor&#39;s list.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Sarzari Shadow Memory:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Great spell for a scroll. At this level, you need to stack the deck entirely in your favor when going after big bosses, and </span><span class="c6">sarzari shadow memory</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;helps you do it. Plus, you get to pray to Achaekek, who will forever be my main mantis.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c41">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Arbitrament:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Good way to piss off your team, unless you&#39;re all some flavor of Neutral.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Balance of Suffering:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;9d6 + CL puts you at around 50 HP dealt and healed, on average. That&rsquo;s not terrible, but I&rsquo;d rather use </span><span class="c6">heal</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;to heal and attacks to hurt. If your target passes their save, you&rsquo;re looking at 35 HP dealt and healed, on average, which is looking less and less appealing.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Besmara&rsquo;s Grasping Depths:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Only useful at sea. You&rsquo;ll know when you&rsquo;re playing such a campaign.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Blasphemy:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Same as for </span><span class="c6 c55">arbitrament.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Circle of Death:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;It caps out at 8 HD, and has a 500 GP material cost. No thanks.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Cleanse:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Forget this one, kiddo, and get </span><span class="c6 c55">heal.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Commune With Texts:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a scroll, if it&rsquo;s anything.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Cruel Jaunt:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;The restrictions are too fiddly for a 6th-level spell, your pinnacle of power.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Cure Moderate Wounds, Mass:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;A thousand times no.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Death Knell Aura, Greater:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;As with the base spell, it&rsquo;s nice to be able to trigger </span><span class="c6">death knell</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;faster, but </span><span class="c6">death knell</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;is easily outclassed as a buff and doesn&rsquo;t stack with itself. What, then, is the point?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Dictum:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;See </span><span class="c6">arbitrament</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c6 c55">blasphemy.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Fester, Mass:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;You probably won&#39;t meet many enemies who want to heal each other in combat.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Forbiddance:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;This is for the Wizard setting up his demiplane, not you.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Glyph of Warding, Greater:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Still not for you.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Harm:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Same basic problem as the </span><span class="c6">inflict</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;line of spells: by the time you get them, you&#39;ve got much, much better ways of dealing that damage.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Inflict Moderate Wounds, Mass:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Blergh.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Legend Lore:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Expensive, time-consuming to cast, and entirely up to GM fiat. Pass.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Litany of Truth:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;You have so many other ways of achieving this effect by now. Use one of them instead.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Plague Bearer:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Urgathoa worshiper only. Good for biological warfare against commoners and not much else. Enemies certainly won&rsquo;t have a difficult time shaking these illnesses.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Prognostication:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Long casting time, expensive material costs, cryptic answers. Pass.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Repulsion:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Will negates, and they can still shoot or cast at you.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Seer&rsquo;s Bane:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Mephistopheles worshiper only. Lacking a means to follow up on your counterstroke, your opposed diviner will heal the damage, remove the curse, and go about business as usual, resolved to be more careful around you next time.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Tactical Insight:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;For mass combat, so probably not your campaign.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Undeath to Death:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Same basic issue as </span><span class="c6 c55">circle of death.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Wither Limb:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">Forced mutation</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;will get you a withered limb </span><span class="c6">and</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;CON/DEX damage as a 3rd-level spell. Redundant.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Word of Chaos:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;See </span><span class="c6">arbitrament.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h1 class="c71 c123" id="h.ch8ot0l3jaah"><span class="c24 c75 c35">INQ440: Feat Dynamics</span></h1><p class="c2"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c28">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mention in other places in this guide, there are a staggering number of options available to players for feats. As a GM, I&rsquo;m in favor of giving my players extra feats that aren&rsquo;t combat-oriented (usually at every even level or every other even level) to encourage them to think outside the box on selection. Pathfinder doesn&rsquo;t incentivize anything other than a combat-effective build, but there&rsquo;s so much more out there that&rsquo;s hilariously fun to play with. Racial feats! Stunning Irruption! Spirit Ally! Many of the feats listed here are only &ldquo;useful&rdquo; in a scenario where your GM is running games as I do, with a little leeway in PCs&rsquo; feat selection. I&rsquo;ll designate these &ldquo;fun or flavorful yet sub-optimal&rdquo; feats in </span><span class="c19">black</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;throughout this section. Inquisitor-only feats will have an asterisk (*) before them.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c24 c68">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="c18" id="h.fwwri9ajthje"><span class="c24 c58">All Characters</span></h2><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c34 c35 c42">Armor Proficiency, Heavy:</span><span class="c28 c41 c34 c47">&nbsp;Two-handed and casting-based Inquisitors may want heavy armor, as it gives them good AC scores with low investment into DEX. The classic mithral breastplate is always an option, too.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c34 c35 c42">Big Game Hunter:</span><span class="c34 c47">&nbsp;Do you have any idea how many enemies past 8th level will be Large or larger? This feat equates to +1 to hit and +2 damage to basically </span><span class="c34 c47 c64">everything.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c34 c35 c42">Cunning Killer:</span><span class="c34">&nbsp;Hoo hoo hoo...what a feat. The only spell this feat will conflict with is </span><span class="c34 c64">anticipate thoughts,</span><span class="c12 c34">&nbsp;which makes it ideal for buffing damage and to-hit on the regular. You&rsquo;re naturally great at Knowledges, too&mdash;what&rsquo;s not to love?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c34 c35 c42">Deific / Demonic / Celestial / Fiendish / Fey / Hellknight Obedience:</span><span class="c12 c34">&nbsp;The Obedience feats are some of my absolute favorites in Pathfinder, giving an immediate benefit and several thematic abilities later in your career, ranging from daily SLAs to entirely new mechanics. Which benefits you get depend entirely on the entity you worship, of course, so some will be better than others. If you&rsquo;re given bonus feats that don&rsquo;t provide large mechanical bonuses, the Obediences are almost always the place I would begin.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c34 c35 c42">Dirty Fighting:</span><span class="c34">&nbsp;The base bonus by itself is decent enough, but take a look at the bottom: </span><span class="c34 c64">&ldquo;</span><span class="c64">This feat counts as having DEX 13, INT 13, Combat Expertise, and Improved Unarmed Strike for the purposes of meeting the prerequisites of the various improved combat maneuver feats, as well as feats that require those improved combat maneuver feats as prerequisites.&rdquo;</span><span>&nbsp;HOLY SHIT. Where has </span><span class="c64">this</span><span>&nbsp;feat been all my life? Dirty Fighting opens up Style feats, maneuver feats, etc. to Inquisitors, who normally wouldn&rsquo;t have the INT or build space to pursue any of those avenues.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c34 c35 c42">Diverse Obedience:</span><span class="c12 c34">&nbsp;Really, really ups the ante for Obediences when you can pick one of three boons at each level. And an acceleration of how fast you get those boons? Perfect!</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c34 c35 c42">Divine Fighting Technique:</span><span class="c12 c34">&nbsp;Most gods in the Inner Sea Pantheon have a divine fighting technique that provides an initial benefit at low levels and an advanced benefit at 10th level or so. These abilities range from dreadful (Calistria) to amazing (Sarenrae), and will be rated individually in the Deity-Specific Feats section below.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c34 c35 c42">Improved Initiative:</span><span class="c12 c34">&nbsp;The poster child for universally useful feats.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c34 c35 c42">Leadership:</span><span class="c12 c34">&nbsp;They won&rsquo;t, but if your GM lets you...nah, just kidding. They won&rsquo;t let you.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c34 c35 c42">Spirit Ridden:</span><span class="c34">&nbsp;The devil&rsquo;s in the details with this one, and depends greatly on your GM. Maybe that personality change is nothing; maybe you&rsquo;re getting sudden urges to murder children. If your GM is lenient with it, you&rsquo;re getting major bonuses to skills with long durations. Imagine suddenly picking up 10+ ranks in UMD when you find that nifty scroll or wand, or for obscure knowledge checks!</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14 c34">* Branded for</span><span class="c34 c35 c47">&nbsp;</span><span class="c34 c35 c42">Retribution:</span><span class="c34 c47">&nbsp;The trade-off here is whether you believe </span><span class="c34 c47 c64">you</span><span class="c34 c47">&nbsp;can hit more times in three rounds, or whether your </span><span class="c34 c47 c64">team</span><span class="c28 c41 c34 c47">&nbsp;can hit more times in one round. For the most part, that&rsquo;s an easy trade: add a full-BAB archer with Rapid Shot, a full-BAB frontliner, and it&rsquo;s all too easy to focus fire and cremate an enemy. Great for going nova on bosses. (Thanks to /u/HighPingVictim for bringing this feat to my attention!)</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14 c34">Combat</span><span class="c34 c35 c47">&nbsp;</span><span class="c34 c35 c42">Patrol:</span><span class="c34 c47">&nbsp;With your longspear proficiency, Combat Patrol is actually a great option, although I wish you could somehow poach </span><span class="c34 c47 c64">longarm</span><span class="c34 c47">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c34 c47 c64">enlarge person</span><span class="c28 c41 c34 c47">. It&rsquo;s an easy way to set up a &ldquo;no-no zone&rdquo; and spread the Bane damage around quickly.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">Wanderer&rsquo;s </span><span class="c35 c42">Fortune:</span><span>&nbsp;Even </span><span class="c64">freedom of movement</span><span>&nbsp;on a limited basis is excellent, especially when you don&rsquo;t need to spend a spell slot to do it! Great pick.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Additional Traits:</span><span class="c28 c21">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">My philosophy as always is to find something flavorful rather than mechanically strong. I see you reaching for Reactionary, you munchkins. H</span><span class="c28 c41 c34 c47">&auml;nde weg.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14 c34">Ambuscading Spell:</span><span class="c28 c41 c34 c47">&nbsp;As a &frac34; caster, you want to take any opportunity possible to buff your casting, and with your initiative boosts, Ambuscading Spell is a great bet.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14 c34">Damned Disciple / Damned Soldier:</span><span class="c12 c34">&nbsp;Diverse Obedience for Hell&rsquo;s Inquisitors. Choosing boons from two of the three Fiendish Obedience prestige classes really helps you get the most bang for your buck.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14 c34">Deceitful Incompetence:</span><span class="c12 c34">&nbsp;Like Combat Patrol, another fabulous feat for AoO/reach weapon builds, providing stacking accuracy bonuses when you miss with your AoOs.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14 c34">Divine Deception:</span><span class="c12 c34">&nbsp;+5 to UMD with divine wands and scrolls. Holy crap, that&rsquo;s good! Get your hands on some Cleric goodies, kids! </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14 c34">Divine Interference:</span><span class="c12 c34">&nbsp;Functionally, it&rsquo;s worse-of-two, which is already a bad deal for enemies. Throw a debuff on top, and you&rsquo;ve got a great ability for keeping allies alive in grueling encounters.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14 c34">Evolved Familiar:</span><span class="c12 c34">&nbsp;Familiars are already good, but Eidolon evolutions make them even better. What you pick will be based heavily off of the role your familiar will be playing.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14 c34">* Extended Bane:</span><span class="c34">&nbsp;You can never, and I mean </span><span class="c34 c64">never,</span><span class="c12 c34">&nbsp;have enough Bane rounds in a day.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14 c34">Feign Curse:</span><span class="c12 c34">&nbsp;What a feat! I like it because it&rsquo;s essentially an upgraded version of the Witch&rsquo;s (already excellent) Misfortune hex. At higher levels, it gets more swingy&mdash;some enemies will have zero ranks in Spellcraft or Sense Motive, while others will have the ranks to beat your feigned curse automatically. How often do you get &ldquo;magic&rdquo; effects that bypass saves and SR, though?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14 c34">* Improved Monster Lore:</span><span class="c12 c34">&nbsp;Ooh, that&rsquo;s tasty! Great for any Inquisitors that didn&rsquo;t trade it away. Knowledge is power. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14 c34">* Instant Judgment:</span><span class="c12 c34">&nbsp;Getting the ability to change a Judgment as an immediate action opens up several tactical avenues: pick up resistance just as the drake spits acid at you, add on a few points of DR to shave damage off a big hit, etc. Not bad, all in all.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14 c34">Noble Stipend:</span><span class="c34">&nbsp;100 gp/week is a </span><span class="c34 c64">lot</span><span class="c12 c34">&nbsp;of money for mundane services and nonmaterial goods. 50 gp is equivalent to 1 lb. of gold. At the time of this writing, 1 lb. of gold is worth roughly $16,000. With that kind of money you can buy hordes of lowly human servitors, or just blow it all on 100 goats/week and start your own farm, pocketing the profits. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14 c34">Prestigious Spellcaster:</span><span class="c12 c34">&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re willing to commit the feats, Prestigious Spellcaster will take the casting sting out of PrCs like Evangelist entirely.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">Tundra Stride:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s not quite the Travel domain, but it&rsquo;s sure close. Because charging, withdrawing, and running all multiply your base speed, you&rsquo;re actually getting anywhere between 20 and 40 ft. of movement bonuses here.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">Weapon Versatility:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;DR vs. slashing/piercing/bludgeoning damage can be tough to penetrate unless you&rsquo;re prepared.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c28 c41 c34 c47"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c34 c35 c37">* Baneful </span><span class="c14 c34">Judgment:</span><span class="c21 c34">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28 c41 c34 c47">10 + CR is easy to beat even at 1st level, so you&rsquo;ll only get better at this skill. Useful for sparing your Judgments in harder one-on-one fights.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c34 c35 c37">* Heavenly</span><span class="c14 c34">&nbsp;Bane:</span><span class="c34">&nbsp;The usefulness here will depend on whether your GM rules that Bane counts as an enhancement bonus for penetrating DR. If so, </span><span class="c34 c37">redundant;</span><span class="c34">&nbsp;if not, </span><span class="c21 c34">far more intriguing.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c28 c41 c34 c47"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c34 c35 c37">Agonizing Obedience:</span><span class="c28 c41 c34 c47">&nbsp;Holy shit. This feat is so metal, it shits bats. Absolutely on-point for Hellknight aspirants or Inquisitors of Zon-Kuthon, but the boons are generally a little weaker than for other Obediences. Your call whether to self-mutilate, friendo.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c34 c35 c37">* Channeling Scourge:</span><span class="c28 c41 c34 c47">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s not unreasonable that an Inquisitor might have picked up channeling abilities from other class levels, and Channeling Scourge will give you the ability to scale that channeling with your class level, as long as you use it to blast people or undead. Not what I would call optimal (channeling is rarely optimal without heavy investment, even for Clerics) but it&rsquo;s an option that&rsquo;s there.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c34 c35 c37">Creature Focus:</span><span class="c12 c34">&nbsp;At last, a means of acquiring Favored Enemy outside of a Ranger dip! It&rsquo;s juuust strong enough not to be counted as a fluff feat, but still probably only a pick if you want an ability that needs FE as a prerequisite.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c34 c35 c37">Expanded Arcana:</span><span class="c12 c34">&nbsp;More spells known, always good. You only get one for the price of a feat, though, and that&rsquo;s not a great use of resources in a feat-starved class.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c34 c35 c37">* Favored Judgment:</span><span class="c34">&nbsp;Good in campaigns that focus on specific enemy types&mdash;Giants in </span><span class="c34 c64">Giantslayer,</span><span class="c34">&nbsp;Undead in </span><span class="c34 c64">Carrion Crown,</span><span class="c34">&nbsp;Demons in </span><span class="c34 c64">Wrath of the Righteous,</span><span class="c12 c34">&nbsp;etc.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c34 c35 c37">* Grant Initiative:</span><span class="c34">&nbsp;Giving your Cunning Initiative bonus to friends always has an opportunity cost, but can be worth it in scenarios where you </span><span class="c34 c64">know</span><span class="c12 c34">&nbsp;someone else could cast an encounter-ending spell or deliver a devastating sneak attack to a flat-footed opponent if only they could act first.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c34 c35 c37">Just Out of Reach:</span><span class="c12 c34">&nbsp;Dodge and Mobility stink as prereqs, but hey, what are you going to do? Fortunately, Just Out of Reach is excellent against all those enormous enemies that can hit you from halfway across the continent. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c34 c35 c37">Lunge:</span><span class="c12 c34">&nbsp;-2 AC for 5 ft. of reach isn&rsquo;t a bad trade-off. It unfortunately only lasts until the end of your turn, making it unsuitable for an AoO build with a longspear or somesuch. (Thanks to /u/ClosetIntrovert for reminding me of that limitation!)</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c34 c35 c37">* Merciful Bane:</span><span class="c12 c34">&nbsp;Taking foes alive is a good tactic in some cases. Inquisitors of Sarenrae have a much better option available to them in their Divine Fighting Technique.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c34 c35 c37">Quick Draw / Quick Stow:</span><span class="c12 c34">&nbsp;These are great filler feats if you ever find yourself with the space, improving action economy in shifting battlefields and negating costly AoOs.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c37">Unsanctioned Detection:</span><span>&nbsp;A 1/day mega-buff to Perception and Sense Motive might well be worth it to you.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c28 c41 c34 c47"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35">Acrobatic Spellcaster:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Best for Inquisitors with light armor, obviously, but still a fun idea because of all the defensive casting you&rsquo;ll be doing.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c34 c35">Armored Athlete:</span><span class="c34 c47">&nbsp;...that said, heavy armor is </span><span class="c34 c47 c64">brutal</span><span class="c34 c47">&nbsp;on your DEX- and STR-based checks. Armor enchantments can alleviate some of the pain (e.g., the </span><span class="c34 c47 c64">creeping</span><span class="c34 c47">&nbsp;enchantment to negate Stealth ACPs) but not all of it. If there&rsquo;s a skill you simply </span><span class="c34 c47 c64">must</span><span class="c34 c47">&nbsp;be good at (Swim in a </span><span class="c34 c47 c64">Ruins of Azlant </span><span class="c34 c47">campaign, e.g.) this is a decent way to do it.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35">Nimble Moves / Acrobatic Steps:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Get out of jail free cards on difficult terrain? Yes, please.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c34 c35 c47">Associate:</span><span class="c28 c41 c34 c47">&nbsp;Despite its appearance in Agents of Evil, Associate is suuuuper flavorful for any Inquisitor. Really helps with the perception that you&rsquo;re living in a fully fleshed-out world in which organizations continue to exist and work toward their goals when you&rsquo;re not around.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c34 c35 c47">Believer&rsquo;s Boon:</span><span class="c28 c41 c34 c47">&nbsp;Mechanically weak, but strengthening your connection to your deity is never bad. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c34 c35 c47">Black Market Dealings:</span><span class="c28 c41 c34 c47">&nbsp;If anyone knows how to access some shady shit, it&rsquo;s Inquisitors.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c34 c35 c47">Call Out:</span><span class="c28 c41 c34 c47">&nbsp;That&rsquo;s right: succeed on an Intimidate check, initiate a duel. Extraordinary flavor for Inquisitors, with their single-target burst damage focus.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c34 c35 c47">Combat Vigor:</span><span class="c34 c47">&nbsp;I can&rsquo;t rate this according to normal standards because of how cheap wands of </span><span class="c34 c47 c64">cure light wounds</span><span class="c28 c41 c34 c47">&nbsp;are, but it&rsquo;s thematic and cool to be able to heal yourself with nothing more than grit and focus.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c34 c35">Deepsight:</span><span class="c12 c34">&nbsp;Increase that 60-ft. Darkvision out to 120 ft. Will most Inquisitors have the build space? Probably not. Still a great feat.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c34 c35">Detect Expertise:</span><span class="c12 c34">&nbsp;Another power that lets you roleplay your Inquisitor as an &ldquo;I know all your darkest secrets at a glance&rdquo; type. Love it.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c34 c35">Devil Sense:</span><span class="c12 c34">&nbsp;Iroran Inquisitors and others who despise devils love this power.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c34 c35">Divine Communion:</span><span class="c34">&nbsp;What </span><span class="c34 c64">would</span><span class="c12 c34">&nbsp;Calistria do? Seduce the town guard? ...yeah, sounds about right.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c34 c35">Esoteric Advantage:</span><span class="c12 c34">&nbsp;While not mechanically strong, Inquisitors are absolutely the types who could pull out some bizarre piece of minutia about a creature to give themselves the upper hand.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c34 c35">Expanded Studies:</span><span class="c12 c34">&nbsp;The feat doesn&rsquo;t explicitly allow Inquisitors, but I don&rsquo;t see why they shouldn&rsquo;t be included; both the Hunter and Warpriest are &frac34; divine casters, same as the Inquisitor.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c34 c35 c47">* Exploit Lore:</span><span class="c12 c34">&nbsp;Great Inquisitor-only ability, hampered only by its 1/day limitation.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c34 c35">* Eyes of Judgment:</span><span class="c34">&nbsp;An extra little oomph on your </span><span class="c34 c64">detect alignment</span><span class="c12 c34">&nbsp;SLAs.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c34 c35">Far-Roaming Familiar:</span><span class="c12 c34">&nbsp;Long-distance scouting for those of you with familiars.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c34 c35">Fleet:</span><span class="c12 c34">&nbsp;Straight +5 ft. to base movement speed. Always, always good, but rarely will you have room.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c34 c35">Friendly Switch:</span><span class="c12 c34">&nbsp;Swap spaces with an ally as a 5-ft. step? Cool.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c34 c35">Ghost Whisperer:</span><span class="c12 c34">&nbsp;Highly thematic for an Inquisitor of Pharasma or Urgathoa, and cool in a supernatural or gothic campaign.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c34 c35">Ghostslayer:</span><span class="c12 c34">&nbsp;Even better for Sanctified Slayers, who can now deal precision damage to ghosties.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c34 c35">* Insightful Gaze:</span><span class="c12 c34">&nbsp;Congrats, you&rsquo;re now the best Sense Motive user in the game!</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c34 c35">Lifeless Gaze:</span><span class="c12 c34">&nbsp;Best poker face in Avistan.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c34 c35">Noble Scion / Enlightened Noble:</span><span class="c12 c34">&nbsp;Love these feats! Something for every character concept here. Mechanically, Scion of Lore and Scion of Peace are your best bets.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c34 c35">Rat Catcher:</span><span class="c34">&nbsp;Every party needs a method of handling swarms. </span><span class="c34 c64">Larger</span><span class="c12 c34">&nbsp;enemies, not smaller, tend to be the rule as levels progress, however.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c34 c35">Read Spell Traces:</span><span class="c12 c34">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a fun flavor feat for everyone. Likely even more thematic for Royal Accusers and other intrigue-oriented archetypes.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c34 c35">Reflexive Caster:</span><span class="c12 c34">&nbsp;You&rsquo;ve got plenty self-only abjuration spells. Worth a look?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c34 c35">Sense Assumptions / Loyalties / Magical Interrogation / Relationships:</span><span class="c12 c34">&nbsp;None are going to make it into a normal build. As bonus feats? That&rsquo;s a different story.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c34 c35">Spirit Ally:</span><span class="c34">&nbsp;The ultimate in harmless feats, a permanent Unseen Servant isn&rsquo;t going to be threatening to any GM unless you cheese </span><span class="c34 c64">hard.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c34 c35">Stunning Irruption:</span><span class="c34">&nbsp;The flavor feat </span><span class="c34 c64">par excellence,</span><span class="c12 c34">&nbsp;there&rsquo;s simply no beating breaking down a wall so hard that you stun everyone on the other side. OH YEAAAAH!</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35">Supernatural Tracker:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Be the best at tracking there ever was.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35">Telepathy Tap:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;TFW your Sense Motive is so high that you can literally read minds.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35">* Thoughtful Discernment:</span><span>&nbsp;The fact-check of the Pathfinder universe.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c47">Thrill of the Hunt:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Tracking using Survival won&rsquo;t be universally useful, and the subsequent morale bonus is quickly superseded. That said, what flavor! Amazing for Inquisitors. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35">Underworld Connections:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Riddleport...you will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35">Veiled Contempt:</span><span>&nbsp;Infiltrators would </span><span class="c64">love</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;this one.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35">Virtuous Creed:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Kind of like a Deific Obedience to a positive character trait? I like Humility best for Inquisitors. It&rsquo;s a strong mechanical benefit, and Inquisitors love to appear less threatening than they really are. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35">War Blessing:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;I like some of these powers that give you extra powers from other classes. War Blessing is one such, giving you two of the Minor Blessings that Warpriests get. At only 2/day, these are probably flavor.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c28 c41 c34 c47">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3 c34">Agile Maneuvers:</span><span class="c28 c34 c47">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a trap! Even if you&rsquo;re finesse-based, Inquisitors still don&rsquo;t have the BAB to compete in the maneuver game long-term. Just leave it.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3 c34">Eldritch Heritage:</span><span class="c12 c34">&nbsp;Skill Focus requirements, minimum CHA scores, few visible benefits until 11th level. Bards, Oracles, and CHA-based Rogues will all see more upside than you will. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3 c34">* Extra Bane:</span><span class="c12 c34">&nbsp;Strictly worse than Extended Bane. Pass. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3 c34">* Judgment Surge:</span><span class="c28 c34">&nbsp;Although </span><span class="c34">second judgment</span><span class="c28 c34">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c34">third judgment</span><span class="c12 c34">&nbsp;will let you apply the surge to more of your active Judgments, 1/day still isn&rsquo;t worth the investment. Pass.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3 c34">* Menacing Bane:</span><span class="c28 c34">&nbsp;You don&rsquo;t get to keep the </span><span class="c6 c34">bane</span><span class="c28 c34">&nbsp;quality, so you&rsquo;re trading a for-sure +2 to hit and 2d6 damage for a potential +2 to hit for you and allies. That&rsquo;s waaay not worth it in my book.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Weapon Focus:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Weapon Focus is like a learner&rsquo;s permit: no one likes it in and of itself, but we all tolerate it because it leads to undeniably cooler things.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Weapon of the Chosen /</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c19 c21">Improved /</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c16">Greater:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Even if the feat chain takes a while to get into, it eventually pays dividends. DR penetration is an ever-necessary tool to have in the toolkit, and Greater Weapon of the Chosen is ideal for Inquisitor builds picking up Vital Strike</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">rolling twice to hit is tasty when you&rsquo;re dealing 3x weapon damage.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12 c34">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c24 c68">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="c18" id="h.melpgyhzh6au"><span class="c24 c58">Archetype-Specific</span></h2><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="c22" id="h.a7jvaiig31s3"><span class="c24 c29">Cloaked Wolf</span></h3><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Betrayer:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Perfect for this playstyle. You&rsquo;ll be beginning most combats by trying to snag a surprise round, and Diplomacy checks are excellent ways to get them. Between the immediate action attack, a standard action attack in the surprise round, and a full attack as combat opens, you could easily have someone dismantled before they even get a chance to respond, especially if your attack leaves them flat-footed.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">Conceal Spell</span><span class="c35">&nbsp;</span><span class="c35 c37">/ Improved:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Cloaked Wolves can do concealed attacks well, but what about casting? Here&rsquo;s your answer. Perfect for debuffing people in plain sight. The improved version just gives you mildly better chances at success.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c37">Catch Off Guard:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Feat tax, pure and simple. You&rsquo;d probably get this for free at my table if you were really dedicated to improvised weapons. Why penalize an already sub-optimal style?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c37">Improvised Weapon Mastery:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Two feats and +8 BAB later, you&rsquo;re finally as good at combat with a chair leg as a person with a real weapon is! Again, I think this should be packaged in somehow for those dedicated to improvised weapons, but maybe that&rsquo;s just me.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c37">Wave Strike:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re going for a Feint build, Wave Strike can help you open a combat more easily. Great for Cloaked Wolf/Sanctified Slayer combos.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35">Intoxicating Flattery:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;A fun way to lower your opponent&rsquo;s guard before you hit them.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35">Secret Signs:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;A decent adjunct to Conceal Spell, but nothing too earth-shattering. Useful if you&rsquo;re given some bonus feats to burn and really want to lean into undetectable casting.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35">Walking Sleight:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Sleight of Hand as a move action. Keep pumping it up as a Cloaked Wolf! </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35">Wary Smuggler:</span><span>&nbsp;The </span><span class="c64">non-weapon</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;item clause impedes this feat somewhat, but it&rsquo;s still fun as a bonus.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Blade Among the Folds (Heavy Armor Trick):</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;The ACP on DEX-based skills (including Sleight of Hand) will be too high in heavy armors to be worth the bonus from Blade Among the Folds. Too bad! It&rsquo;s another one that would work well for Cloaked Wolves in a kinder world.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c46 c35">Chairbreaker:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;An extra 1d4 damage won&rsquo;t blow anyone&rsquo;s skirt up, even those using improvised weapon builds. Pass.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c46 c35">Cunning Caster:</span><span>&nbsp;Waaay too many penalties to the Bluff check. You&rsquo;ll never pull this off unless the skill has been buffed to obscene levels.</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Sly Draw:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">As far as I can tell, Sly Draw applies only to a Feint performed immediately after you draw your weapon, as in Wave Strike. That&rsquo;s not too useful. If it applies to all feints when using a light weapon, that&rsquo;s </span><span class="c28 c21">much better </span><span class="c12">for Cloaked Wolves.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="c22" id="h.vqi8w7za2gne"><span class="c24 c29">Living Grimoire</span></h3><p class="c7"><span class="c20 c19">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">Focused Shot:</span><span>&nbsp;Makes casting-focused Living Grimoires much more viable by letting them use their casting stat for accuracy with bows and crossbows.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c20 c19"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Briliant Spell Preparation:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Some GMs will let you leave slots open at the start of the day anyway</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">after all, there&rsquo;s nothing forbidding you from doing it if you want to take an hour in the middle of the day to re-prepare. Lowering that time penalty to 15 minutes is an okay upgrade. I wish you got more prepared slots, though.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Esoteric Linguistics:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;With an INT focus, you&rsquo;re much better at Linguistics than you used to be, which opens the way for some of the fun feats that replace skill checks.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Orator:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Replace important face skills with Linguistics! Fun fun fun. And how cool would it be to spew fiery rhetoric off the battlefield, as well as on it? </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Legalistic Reading:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;This is the archetype best suited to make use of scrolls, largely because of the Pragmatic Activator trait and a natural focus on Linguistics. And using scrolls twice? How cool is that!?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="c22" id="h.ea8q8iy1tcek"><span class="c24 c29">Monster Tactician</span></h3><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c42">Evolved Summon Monster:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Ah, I&rsquo;m glad Paizo finally got wise to Pounce and Reach being OP for 1-point evolutions. Even with those abilities off the table, Evolved Summon Monster still gives you unparalleled latitude to customize creatures as you summon them. Worst case, you get better armor or attacks; best case, an evolution like Swim saves the day in a fringe scenario that you don&rsquo;t usually encounter.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c42">Summon [Alignment] Monster:</span><span>&nbsp;That much better option for expanding your portfolio of summons? This is it. Five or six new options </span><span class="c64">per summon monster level,</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;and an additional bonus depending on your alignment&mdash;Goodies get Diehard, Baddies get to be summoned with a standard action, and Neutries get a +2 resistance bonus to Will saves. (It should be noted that Monster Tacticians already summon creatures as a standard action, so those who selected Summon Evil Monster have a little redundancy for that portion of the feat.) Look. No. Further.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Augment Summoning:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Good for keeping trash summons relevant for longer, as well as for when you summon packs of creatures, all of which will benefit from the increased STR and CON. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Expanded Summon Monster:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Not bad! You&rsquo;ll get an even better option for expanding your portfolio later. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Superior Summoning:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;As with Augment Summoning, this feat keeps your lower-level summons relevant for much longer, in addition to putting more SLAs at your team&rsquo;s disposal.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Versatile Summon Monster:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;I&rsquo;d probably pick Dark/Primordial and one of the elemental templates.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35">Profane Studies:</span><span>&nbsp;The duration buff is ultimately irrelevant to Monster Tacticians, who get the minutes/level Summoner versions of </span><span class="c64">summon monster</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;spells. Great boost to Kn(Planes), though!</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="c22" id="h.mv5iftf3sv2m"><span class="c24 c29">Ravener Hunter</span></h3><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Abundant Revelations:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Extra uses of your Revelations are always fantastic.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Extra Revelation:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Remember, you can&rsquo;t have this one, per the archetype text. :(</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="c22" id="h.pl736mcr4uet"><span class="c24 c29">Sacred Huntsmaster</span></h3><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c42">Monstrous Companion:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Magical beasts make fantastic companions. First of all, they&rsquo;re intelligent, which makes for even cooler RP. Second, they often come with resistances, SR, SLAs, or exotic special abilities. You want those! </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c42">Planar Focus:</span><span>&nbsp;Expanded options for your Animal Focus, and some excellent ones at that. Plane of Fire focus is especially good for damage output, but check the Sacred Huntsmaster section for a complete write-up.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Beastmaster Style / </span><span class="c16">Beastmaster Salvation / Beastmaster Ire:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;A relatively new set of feats from </span><span class="c6">Ultimate Wilderness</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;that Sacred Huntsmasters should absolutely want to get their hands on. The basic style feat, which has no real prerequisites apart from CHA 13, lets you substitute a Handle Animal check for your companion&rsquo;s AC against one attack per round as an immediate action; Salvation lets you do it for a saving throw. Lastly, Ire gives you a frankly </span><span class="c6">insane</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;boost to damage and attack rolls if the enemy even attempted to attack your companion, much less dealt damage. If you&rsquo;re playing a simple STR/WIS Power Attack build and have the feats to spare, there are </span><span class="c6">very</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;few reasons not to take the Beastmaster line.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Disruptive Companion:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;You normally have to be a Fighter (or select the Spellkiller Inquisition) to get the excellent Disruptive feat, but companions can get it (albeit at a lesser bonus) with no levels in Fighter. Even better, this feat qualifies companions for feats like Spellbreaker, which can be horrifyingly effective for companions with reach, Combat Reflexes, or both.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">Ferocious Beast:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Animal companions only. It&rsquo;s Stern Gaze (well, half of it, anyway) for your companion! Great if you both want to be masters of demoralization.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">Totem Beast:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Permanent Animal Aspect for your companion! A lenient GM might allow your companion to spend the feat, rather than you.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Evolved Companion:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Eidolon evolutions are still quite powerful, even without Pounce or Reach, but perhaps just not universally useful. (Thanks to /u/fishmcfish for pointing out that those two are not allowed!)</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c37">Spirit&rsquo;s Gift:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;There aren&rsquo;t any game-changing options among the Shaman spirits, but the fact that you get to choose each day lends it versatility.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Extended Animal Focus:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Will you have space? Likely not. Is it useful? Of course!</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Feral Grace:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Animal companions only. It&rsquo;s your DEX-to-damage feat if your companion uses Finesse. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Genie-Touched Companion:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;The genie-touched companion functions as a horse companion, which isn&rsquo;t too great. If your GM rules that you can make regular companions genie-touched, this feat is at least </span><span class="c28 c21">green,</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;possibly </span><span class="c28 c41 c42">blue.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35">Tenacious Hunter:</span><span>&nbsp;Animal companions only. Stealth DCs are nigh-impossible to make vs. invisible opponents, even with +10 to the Perception check. I like that animals can hit flat-footed AC if they do manage to spot the enemy, though&mdash;the invisible beasties are often the ones most worried about flat-footed AC.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c28 c41 c42"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c46 c35">Monstrous Mount:</span><span>&nbsp;Seems like you should be able to take it, but you don&rsquo;t technically have the class features listed.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="c22" id="h.40a3ptgqj6hw"><span class="c24 c29">Sanctified Slayer</span></h3><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c20 c19"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c42">Dampen Presence:</span><span>&nbsp;Blindsense and blindsight are </span><span class="c64">huge</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;pains to deal with when you rely on Stealth to deal most of your damage. That&rsquo;s no longer an issue with Dampen Presence.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c42">Flensing Strike:</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c64">The</span><span>&nbsp;best feat available for Sanctified Slayers, period. You simply cannot do better than the sickened condition </span><span class="c64">and</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;permanently reducing a foe&rsquo;s natural armor bonus. Besides, the Bleeding Attack Rogue talent is one of the only ones that&rsquo;s worth taking with your Slayer talents, so you might as well pick up the prerequisite.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c42">Shadow&rsquo;s Shroud:</span><span>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s like </span><span class="c64">shield of darkness,</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;except you can use it for Stealth! Excellent, excellent feat, potentially even rendering a Shadowdancer dip obsolete.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c42">Violent Display:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;The feat comes with some Weretiger flavor and isn&rsquo;t PFS-legal, but holy shit, you can see why. Violent Display is the third leg of the Dazzling Display/Shatter Defenses/Violent Display trifecta that allows Intimidation-based Rogues and Slayers &nbsp;unlimited sneak attack, all day long. The chain goes something like this: Intimidate an enemy, which makes them flat-footed vs. the rest of your attacks via Shatter Defenses; execute a sneak attack against the flat-footed enemy; immediate action Dazzling Display via Violent Display to demoralize other enemies within a 30-ft. radius.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">Focused Target:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Good for boss fights.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">Gang Up:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Anyone with sneak attack dice loves flanking. Gang Up lets you flank better. &lsquo;Nough said.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">Shadows of Fear:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t want to do Shatter Defenses? Don&rsquo;t worry! You&rsquo;ll still get your SA damage at least once per round if they&rsquo;re shaken. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">Shatter Defenses:</span><span>&nbsp;The advantage of Shatter Defenses over Shadows of Fear is that it makes the enemy flat-footed against </span><span class="c64">all</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;your attacks until the next round, an arrangement ideal for characters who are full-attacking constantly. On the downside, Shatter Defenses has two feat prerequisites and pretty steep BAB entry for Inquisitors. Your call whether that trade-off is worth it for you. Shadows of Fear could still be viable for Vital Strike or Spring Attack builds.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c20 c19"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Accomplished Sneak Attacker:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s not a great feat in and of itself, but you may need to select it in order to access feats that have more intensive sneak attack prerequisites.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c37">Hellcat Stealth:</span><span>&nbsp;Sanctified Slayers have a definite edge over Rogues and Slayers in that they can cast spells like </span><span class="c64">invisibility</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;to set up sneak attack. Sometimes you need those spells for other things, though, which makes abilities like Hide in Plain Sight all the more valuable. Hellcat Stealth has its problems&mdash;penalty to the Stealth check, lighting restrictions&mdash;but overall is one of the only universally available tools for getting sneak attacks off alone and without help from other skills or spells.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c37">Seething Hatred:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Again, depends on how single-minded your campaign is about enemy types.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c37">Surprise Maneuver:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Makes you full BAB for the purposes of maneuvers, for whatever that&rsquo;s worth to you.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c37">Surprising Combatant:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Hard to know quite where to put this feat. Here, I guess, since Sanctified Slayers benefit so greatly from flat-footed opponents.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c37">Visceral Threat:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;If you&rsquo;d rather feint as a Sanctified Slayer, here&rsquo;s your route, which benefits from Stern Gaze.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35">Dastardly Finish / Merciless Butchery / Brutal Coup de Grace:</span><span>&nbsp;This is a trio that works together </span><span class="c64">marvelously</span><span>&nbsp;for Sanctified Slayers at high levels (15+). Dazzling Display + the Unchained Intimidate Skill Unlock at the start of combat will hopefully drive a few enemies straight to cowering; </span><span class="c64">castigate</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;can achieve cowering at lower levels for single targets. If you move to cowering enemies and coup de grace as a standard action, you get a free Dazzling Display, which then causes more targets to cower...you see how the cycle keeps on keepin&rsquo; on. It&rsquo;s a big feat investment, though, and won&rsquo;t work on every enemy.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35">Shadow Strike:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Dealing precision damage to targets with concealment is an attractive prospect, especially if you&rsquo;re playing as a human, for whom lighting rules are prone to give out concealment.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Careful Sneak / Exquisite Sneak:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Obviated by the </span><span class="c6">creeping</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;armor enchantment, which is cheap and doesn&rsquo;t eat into your total enhancement bonus</span><span>.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="c22" id="h.getvwclvu4b9"><span class="c24 c29">Spellbreaker &amp; Witch Hunter</span></h3><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c42">Scrutinize Spell:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Oof, is this good for Witch Hunters.

Atheist Abjurations! </span><span class="c6">Dispel magic</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;is never a wasted spell known, so get comfortable with using it quite a bit.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">Focused Disbelief:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Not many ways to acquire SR in Pathfinder, but here&rsquo;s one for only two feats! The standard action to lower resistance takes it down from blue, just because allies will have to pass a caster level check to buff you unless you slow your roll.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">Step Up</span><span class="c35">&nbsp;/ </span><span class="c35 c42">Following Step</span><span class="c35">&nbsp;/ </span><span class="c35 c42">Step Up and Strike:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Your suite of abilities for following casters as they attempt to back away from you. They&rsquo;re brutal against enemies that are relying on five-foot steps to keep them safe.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">Unimpeachable Honor:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Between all your defensive abilities, you can probably avoid enchantment effects altogether. If not, however, Unimpeachable Honor ensures that you won&rsquo;t do any harm while controlled.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Divine</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c19 c21">Defiance:</span><span class="c28 c21">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">An untyped +2 to saves against divine spells isn&rsquo;t anything to snicker at.

And it&rsquo;s tied to the Animal domain, which is already amazing? (Plant, well, eh.) Fabulous stuff, especially because you&rsquo;ll be using </span><span class="c64">cure</span><span>&nbsp;spells primarily with wands, not daily spell slots.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">Dispel Synergy:</span><span>&nbsp;Anything, I repeat </span><span class="c64">anything</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;that lets you lower enemies&rsquo; saves is something you should be interested in.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">Spell Penetration:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;As long as you heed the important caveat that Inquisitors will never be great at offensive casting, Spell Penetration can still do good work. Every bit of SR penetration helps.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">Steadfast Mind:</span><span>&nbsp;In general, of course, we should be aiming </span><span class="c64">not</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;to fail defensive castings, but if you do, there&rsquo;s nothing like getting a chance at keeping your spell slot.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">Warrior Priest:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s like Combat Casting, except you also get an initiative bonus! Definitely nice.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c37">Uncanny</span><span class="c35">&nbsp;</span><span class="c14">Concentration:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s at least as good as Combat Casting, and depending on your GM&rsquo;s familiarity with concentration check rules, might be better.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c20 c19"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Combat Casting:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Losing spells hurts. Warrior Priest is strictly better, however.</span><span class="c20 c19">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Destructive Dispel:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Even if the enemy caster passes the Fort save to avoid the stun, they&rsquo;re still sickened. Not too shabby.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c37">Knowledgeable Spellcaster:</span><span>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a pity that the application is so narrowly confined to one enemy type, because even out of the package you get more SR penetration than Spell Penetration. Definitely worth a look if your campaign focuses on one enemy type&mdash;Monster Lore certainly sets you up nicely for it.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Minor Miracle:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;A 1st-level spell 1/day isn&rsquo;t strong enough to use one of your normal feats, but it might also weak enough that GMs aren&rsquo;t scared to give it to you for free.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="c22" id="h.ac7w718s4zck"><span class="c24 c29">Crit Fishing</span></h3><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c42">Critical, Improved:</span><span>&nbsp;Ah, this one&rsquo;s excellent. </span><span class="c64">Keen</span><span>&nbsp;as a feat, doubling the threat range of any weapon. Inquisitors of Sarenrae, Cayden Cailean, and Lamashtu will appreciate it particularly.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Butterfly Sting:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Desna worshiper only. If you do happen to worship Desna, this can be a great tool. Much of your damage will come from Bane, which isn&rsquo;t multiplied on a crit</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c28">so why not give that crit to someone who can use it better? Obviously works best if you&rsquo;re wielding a high crit range weapon like a rapier; you&rsquo;d have to pick up proficiency through racial or feat options, though, because the starknife will always be lackluster for anyone except a Warpriest.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">Destroy Identity:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Lamashtu worshiper only. Can be particularly devastating against Bards, Sorcerers, Bloodragers&mdash;any class that uses CHA as its casting stat, really. The BAB requirement is up there, though, and there&rsquo;s always the small matter of Lamashtu.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Critical, Blinding (etc.):</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Late, late access for you. There are some good options on here, but only for the very end of campaigns.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Critical Focus:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Unfortunately necessary for getting into Critical feats. Only two certainties in Pathfinder: death and feat taxes. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Disposable Weapon:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Not actually as bad as all that if you&rsquo;ve got someone with </span><span class="c6">mending</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;on the team.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="c22" id="h.j9cmkxpgep0m"><span class="c24 c29">Crossbow</span></h3><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">Crossbow Mastery: </span><span class="c12">You&rsquo;ll need to work up to this eventually if you really want to go with crossbows&mdash;the free action reload is too good to pass up.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c37">Rapid Reload:</span><span>&nbsp;For those using light crossbows and primarily casting, this is as far as you need to go.

Combat Patrol increases your threatened area, letting you spread Bane damage around even when it&rsquo;s not your turn.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c42">Piranha Strike:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s Power Attack for Finesse fighters. What more needs to be said?</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Bladed Brush:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Shelyn gets special mention for a Finesse-esque feat that&rsquo;s A and B the C of D (that&rsquo;s Above and Beyond the Call of Duty, kids). DEX to hit for glaives is an interesting take, and it provides multiple other benefits that might be of interest, not least of which is the ability to threaten 5 ft. away with a weapon that&rsquo;s normally reach-only.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Dervish Dance / Fencing Grace / Slashing Grace / Starry Grace:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Each of these feats has the same general purpose: to use your DEX modifier for damage rolls, instead of STR. They are all weapon-specific, and usually deity-specific, as well (e.g., Desna for starknives, Sarenrae for scimitars, Iomedae for longswords, etc.).</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">Spring Attack:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Spring Attack is one of those feats like Quick Draw that often doesn&rsquo;t figure into &ldquo;optimized&rdquo; builds, yet still affords you many more degrees of freedom than you&rsquo;d otherwise have, particularly if you&rsquo;ve got high Acrobatics to avoid AoOs. If this feat makes it to 2e, I predict it&rsquo;ll undergo a bit of a renaissance, as fewer enemies will have access to AoOs at all. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">Wind /</span><span class="c35">&nbsp;</span><span class="c14">Lightning Stance:</span><span>&nbsp;These feats make you </span><span class="c64">incredibly</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;difficult to pin down, and concealment chances always scale well, even into later levels.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Combat </span><span class="c19 c21">Reflexes:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;The higher your DEX, the better it gets. Ideal and necessary for any build taking advantage of Combat Patrol.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Dodge / Mobility:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Mobility is no one&rsquo;s idea of a good time, and Dodge barely does better. They open the path to some better feats, though.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c37">Weapon Finesse:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Obviously necessary for this fighting style, but nothing more than a feat tax.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Graceful Athlete:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;For those who think climbing and swimming should be more about technique, not raw strength.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="c22" id="h.7xzx2cjatlet"><span class="c24 c29">Intimidate</span></h3><p class="c7"><span class="c20 c28">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c42">Enforcer:</span><span>&nbsp;Hohoho. Jewel of the Intimimancer&rsquo;s crown, Enforcer gets you some </span><span class="c64">serious</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;duration on the shaken duration, a means of demoralizing as a free action, and all with very affordable entry requirements. All you need are boosts to Intimidate and a means of escalating fear conditions, and you&rsquo;re a holy terror on the battlefield. Inquisitors of Sarenrae should think about pairing Enforcer with either Sarenrae&rsquo;s Mercy or the Blade of Mercy Religion trait in order to take full advantage of the nonlethal &rarr; demoralize chain. (Thanks, /u/T3h_Prager, for introducing me to that excellent trait!)</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c42">Hurtful:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Thanks to the swift action, you&rsquo;re limited to a single Hurtful attack per turn, but each one is another source of Bane, Judgment, and weapon damage. Take it and enjoy.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c42">Signature Skill (Intimidate):</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;The Pathfinder Unchained skill unlock feats are...interesting. Many of them feel less like complete reimaginings of what you can do with the skills so much as reductions to annoying penalties&mdash;slight improvements to bookkeeping, in short. Not so with Intimidate. Grab this feat, and you&rsquo;re suddenly able to escalate fear conditions beyond shaken with good checks, all the way up to cowering in later levels. That&rsquo;s amazing, because any enemy that&rsquo;s fleeing in terror isn&rsquo;t damaging the team.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">Disheartening Display:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Great in conjunction with the Intimidate Skill Unlock&mdash;lets you push enemies ever closer to total, blind panic.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">Dreadful Carnage:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Kill an enemy, get a free DD. Pretty straightforward, and very useful. Note that it comes in at a high level. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">Golden League Tattoos:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Ifrit can usually get the ability to take 10 on Intimidate checks, but for the rest of us, there&rsquo;s Golden League Tattoos. Obviously only works if you&rsquo;ve got connections to Tian Xia.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c20 c19"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Bludgeoner:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Why am I including a feat for dealing nonlethal damage? Why, because of the amazing Enforcer feat, of course! Bludgeoner isn&rsquo;t great on its own, but it extends the utility of Enforcer beyond Improved Unarmed Strike and &nbsp;Sarenrae&rsquo;s Divine Fighting Technique. All of a sudden, you can use any bludgeoning weapon with Enforcer, and that&rsquo;s a </span><span class="c28 c42">big deal.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Dazzling Display:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Dazzling Display isn&rsquo;t overwhelmingly good on its own, but it&rsquo;s the entry point for many other Intimidate-based feats. The addition of the Intimidate Skill Unlock from Pathfinder Unchained makes DD </span><span class="c28 c42">much better,</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;as you&rsquo;re suddenly able to bump fear severity up to frightened or even panicked/cowering...but more on that later.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c37">Gory Finish:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Functionally similar to Dreadful Carnage, except you trade Dreadful Carnage&rsquo;s later entry for Gory Finish&rsquo;s single attack action. Because it only allows that single attack, it actually pairs nicely with Vital Strike.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c37">* Intimidating</span><span class="c35">&nbsp;</span><span class="c35 c37">Bane:</span><span>&nbsp;By itself, </span><span class="c37">it&rsquo;s not much.</span><span>&nbsp;If your GM rules that you can keep more severe fear conditions up and running while Bane is active (say, with the Intimidate Skill Unlock) then this becomes </span><span class="c28 c41 c42">incredibly useful.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c37">Intimidating Prowess:</span><span>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s not the brightest bulb of the bunch, but every little bonus helps when demoralizing.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Destructive Persuasion:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Break shit, scare folks. That&rsquo;s what the Inquisitor is all about, no?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35">Position of Strength:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Good for frightening hapless peons, not enemies. Fun, though!</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35">Shocking Bellow:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;It probably won&rsquo;t earn a spot in most builds, but a free demoralize check at the start of battle ain&rsquo;t bad.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35">Sinister Reputation:</span><span>&nbsp;I love the idea of an Inquisitor&rsquo;s terrifying reputation preceding them into town. Good enough to merit a regular feat?

Improved Snap Shot ups your game, however, by allowing you to threaten 10 ft.

So why not give that critical to someone who can use it more effectively? This feat is especially effective for characters who can pick up access to martial weapons with higher crit ranges, like Grippli and their rapier proficiency, or Half-Elves and the Elven Curve Blade.

First, it&rsquo;s thematic as fuck for Sarenrae, who always gives even the most hardened of criminals a chance to repent and come over to the light. Second, take a gander at the Enforcer feat. Starting to see the uses? By the time you get to the advanced benefit, you&rsquo;re essentially casting </span><span class="c6">cure light wounds</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;on yourself </span><span class="c19">every round.</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Now, granted, hit point damage isn&rsquo;t the most dangerous thing lurking in the later stages of campaigns: you&rsquo;ve got save-or-die effects, permanent polymorphs, ability drain, negative levels...still, HP damage almost always comes wrapped up in there somewhere, and you can heal it </span><span class="c6">during combat.</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;On your own. That&rsquo;s fantastic. If you&rsquo;re not interested in investing a feat in the DFT, the PFS-legal Religion trait Blade of Mercy can take away your </span><span>nonlethal</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;penalty while also giving you a nice little bump in damage.

Brutal. I like that you still get a bonus when two-handing, too.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Cornugon Shield:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Inquisitors will never be the beefiest combatants on the field. Not bad, getting a shield bonus with your primary weapon.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">Dance of Chains:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;DEX-to-damage for the spiked chain. A no-brainer if you&rsquo;re going the Finesse route. Prereqs are a little steep.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">Zon-Kuthon&rsquo;s Flensing (Divine Fighting Technique):</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;The bad news is that you&rsquo;ve got to debuff yourself to see any benefits here&mdash;but c&rsquo;mon, it&rsquo;s Zon-Kuthon, so what were you expecting? The good news is that the immediate, no-save sickened condition opens enemies up to become nauseated. If that happens, it&rsquo;s game over for them.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35">Endure Pain:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Definitely not worth a feat pick in your normal progression. As a bonus? Well, maybe still not worth it. But damn, can a Kuthite get more thematic than being tortured 10+ times?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35">Flagellant:</span><span>&nbsp;Neither [pain] effects nor nonlethal damage are common. I&rsquo;m not sure how or when you </span><span class="c64">do</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;fall unconscious with this feat, but I&rsquo;m inclined to say that it&rsquo;s just below 0 HP.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Cornugon Trip:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Unless you&rsquo;ve got a means of getting that chain back, no, don&rsquo;t throw your primary weapon.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="c18" id="h.hrvi2jozkna9"><span class="c24 c58">Teamwork Feats</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Allied Spellcaster:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Casting builds are possible with Spell Bane and the shaken/sickened conditions to drop enemies&rsquo; saves. What the Inquisitor is lacking, however, is a means to reliably pierce SR, which begins to kick in in earnest around 9th level. Should you be going for a casting build, this feat is absolute gold, making it easy to get those SR penetration bonuses just by moving next to an ally. If you&rsquo;re near another caster with your spell prepared, you get double the bonuses </span><span class="c6">and</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;a boost to CL for other effects like range and duration. It&rsquo;s a mark of how powerful this feat is that it&rsquo;s </span><span class="c20 c28">still decent in non-caster builds.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c42">Coordinated Charge:</span><span>&nbsp;Charge has its limitations, and this feat places one more on by allowing you to move only up to your speed. </span><span class="c64">That said,</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;you&rsquo;re getting a full-round action for the cost of an immediate action and zipping around the battlefield like a hopped up pinball. Melee characters can&rsquo;t beat the action economy and free attacks, and Inquisitors with Cavalier allies will learn to adore how synchronized this feat makes them.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c42">Escape Route:</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c64">Very</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;useful for when you need to get out of a tight spot. There are some cool shenanigans with the Reaper of Secrets archetype (bleh though it is) and the Mind Games class feature you can pull with Escape Route. Basically, if you&rsquo;ve used your Gaze on an enemy, it can&rsquo;t target you with AoOs while you&rsquo;re adjacent; you&rsquo;re treating it as an ally, and you don&rsquo;t provoke for moving in squares adjacent to an ally.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c42">Friendly Fire Maneuvers:</span><span>&nbsp;Cover stinks for ranged characters, and there&rsquo;s little chance of a respite until you can get Lob Shot, Circuitous Shot, or Improved Precise Shot. Friendly Fire Maneuvers at least fixes cover provided by melee friends, making crowded scrums a lot less difficult to shoot into. </span><span class="c46">Melee Inquisitors will pass,</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;the other benefits not being worth your while.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c42">Improved Outflank:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Every melee Inquisitor should get Outflank and Improved Outflank at some point in their career. Period. They&rsquo;re just too good, especially for Sanctified Slayers who rely on flanking to deal out SA damage.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c42">Improved Spell Sharing:</span><span>&nbsp;This feat will really only be appealing to Sacred Huntsmasters, but holy cow, what a feat. With your companion sharing </span><span class="c64">wrath, divine favor,</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;etc., you really will be unstoppable. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c42">Living Fortress:</span><span class="c42">&nbsp;</span><span>Dwarf only, and encapsulates perfectly why Dwarves make the best Magehunters. An additional +2 vs. spells and SLAs, </span><span class="c64">on top of</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Hardy and Steel Soul? Yeah. You want this.&trade; </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c42">Outflank:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Flanking is always a tactically sound move; Outflank just incentivizes it to a scary degree. Sanctified Slayers especially will want this feat for its ability to proc sneak attack.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c42">Overwhelm:</span><span>&nbsp;Even for two Medium characters, this feat still allows you to flank Huge, Gargantuan, and Colossal enemies from anywhere. </span><span class="c64">Anywhere.</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Imagine Outflank bonuses against most enemies in the later levels. Imagine it, I say!</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c42">Scarred Legion:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Is there anything better than an untyped bonus to Intimidate and Will saves? Let me answer that rhetorical question for you: no.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c42">Shake It Off:</span><span class="c42">&nbsp;</span><span>Untyped bonuses to </span><span class="c64">all saves</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;are an absolute must for just about any build. Get it. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c42">Shielded Caster:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Awesome feat for just about anyone interested in casting while threatened. You&rsquo;ll probably want it.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c42">Target of Opportunity:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;For ranged characters only. Easy extra attacks, with all the Bane damage that entails.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">Coordinated Capture:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;One of a trifecta of feats (Coordinated Distraction, Coordinated Capture, and Crowd Control) that deals with enemies making Acrobatics and Concentration checks to avoid AoOs. Distraction gives you just Concentration, Crowd Control gives you just Acrobatics, and Capture gives you a mix of the two. Quite, quite nice. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">Coordinated Distraction:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s more specialized than Coordinated Capture, but it essentially approaches the defensive casting problem from the other angle, raising the DC rather than lowering the bonus to the Concentration check. At any rate, endorsed for Magehunter builds. Good stuff.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">Coordinated Shot:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Easy +1 to ranged attacks. Make sure you have Precise Shot so you&rsquo;re not stacking a -4 penalty to shoot into melee range on top of that +1, though.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">Duck and Cover:</span><span>&nbsp;Now here&rsquo;s an interesting one. Inquisitors will never be all that great at Reflex saves, and although they&rsquo;re by far the least serious saves to fail, they still can involve some nasty damage. What if you could take your Rogue friend&rsquo;s save, though? Falling prone is obviously bad, but you&rsquo;re never </span><span class="c64">required</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;to take that option, only allowed to. The clause about an AC bonus when adjacent to an ally with a shield is mostly fluff, as shield builds are vanishingly rare in Pathfinder.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">Enfilading Fire:</span><span>&nbsp;Stacks with Coordinated Shot for some truly ridiculous bonuses to hit. If you&rsquo;re at range, and they&rsquo;re flanked, they&rsquo;re toast. (Thanks to /u/T3h_Prager for reminding me that they </span><span class="c64">do</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;stack!)</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">Lastwall Phalanx:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Obviously reliant on Evil enemies&mdash;lucky for you, most enemies are.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">Lookout:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Sticking close to the party Rogue or your animal companion can help you take advantage of this feat. Getting a full round&rsquo;s worth of actions in a surprise round is tasty, tasty.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">Paired Opportunists:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Especially lethal in DEX/Reach/Combat Patrol builds where AoOs will be happening every time an enemy attempts to do...well, basically anything.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">Precise Strike:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Easy +1d6 of damage whenever you&rsquo;re flanking an enemy, which you should be doing whenever possible anyway. No real downsides here.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">Shared Remembrance:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;You have to be an Elf to get it, so meh for Inquisitors, but still, this feat will make you the undisputed King/Queen of Monster Identification. (Oh, what a heavy crown to wear!)</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">Spirit of the Corps:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;It would be difficult to track morale bonuses for the entire team in order to know when and how to use this feat, but that doesn&rsquo;t make it a bad effect, just an advanced one.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">Stealth Synergy:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Terribly worded feat. I think the community has arrived at a satisfying definition, though. Inquisitors aren&rsquo;t known to be the stealthiest lot (unless you&rsquo;re playing with an archetype that gets bonuses) so it&rsquo;s nice to be able to poach rolls from other PCs.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">Trade Initiative:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Sometimes, it&rsquo;s not important for you to go first, especially if the Wizard has a pit, wall, etc. up their sleeve and just needs to get it off quickly in order to save the entire party. It&rsquo;s okay to help other people sometimes, kiddo.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c20 c28"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c37">Broken Wing Gambit:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Useful only for Tactical Leaders and Sacred Huntsmasters&mdash;your allies need to actually have the feat in order to take advantage of the AoOs. Even then, putting your own hide on the line is still a risky maneuver&mdash;a gambit, even. I&rsquo;d probably think twice before using the ability.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c37">Circling Offense:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Also TL/SH only, unfortunately, and it&rsquo;s a pity, because it&rsquo;s an excellent feat. Inquisitors running DEX/Reach builds will already have the prerequisite feats, and it&rsquo;s an ideal way to needle large enemies to death.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c37">Coordinated Defense:</span><span>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s not bad, per se, just lackluster. You definitely don&rsquo;t want to be grappled, swallowed whole, tripped, etc. Will this feat let you avoid those? Eh, maybe. You&rsquo;re generally better off keeping a spell like </span><span class="c64">freedom of movement</span><span>&nbsp;in your back pocket, or if you&rsquo;ve money to burn, a </span><span class="c6 c55">ring of freedom of movement.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c37">Coordinated Reposition:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Any feat that gives you free 5-ft. steps must be taken into consideration. Note that you&rsquo;re trading your swift action in the next round by taking an immediate action off-turn, however, and that without size increases or reach weapons you might not threaten the same enemy as your allies much of the time.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c37">Covering Fire:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Decent debuff for Black Powder Inquisitors. Everyone else can skip.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c37">Distracting Charge:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;A bit finicky on the conditions, but ranged Inquisitors in a party with a charge-happy comrade (Cavaliers, some Paladins, Samurai, etc.) could probably take advantage.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c37">Feint Partner:</span><span class="c37">&nbsp;</span><span>Sanctified Slayers aren&rsquo;t great at feinting, but who knows, maybe someone on your team is! If they are, stick close by them, because each of their feints will also deny the enemy&rsquo;s DEX bonus for </span><span class="c64">you.</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;That means it&rsquo;s time to meet the mayor of Sneakattacktown.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c37">Hammer Guards the Anvil:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Between this feat and Escape Route, you&rsquo;re gradually becoming able to ignore AoOs for a multitude of actions. Worth considering.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c37">Pack Attack:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Potentially useful for Sacred Huntsmasters to gradually move into flanking position with their companions.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c37">Protective Line:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Again, for Black Powder Inquisitors. Everyone else, move on.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c37">Punch Through:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Quite good for Tactical Leaders, who can share this feat among the team and get everyone through DR. Incompatible with Solo Tactics, sadly.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c37">Swing About:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Can actually help with tactical positioning, which is everything in this game.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c37">Tandem Trip:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Wolf Domain Inquisitors will love this one&mdash;see the Animal-Friend build at the end of the guide for an example of how to use Tandem Trip.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c37">Volley Fire:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Gets better the more ranged teammates you have, obvies.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35">Drinking Buddy:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Who cares whether the rest of the team is drunk? It&rsquo;s 5:00 somewhere, and you get to treat them as if they were! Worship the Accidental God and go enjoy your 1/day free reroll, ya lush.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35">Horde Charge:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Half-orc or orc only, and mentioned only because of its obvious synergy with Coordinated Charge.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Back to Back:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Only negates enemies&rsquo; flanking bonus, and the circumstances under which you would receive it are finicky. Best to just get out of the flank by taking a 5 ft. step diagonally.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Blades Above and Below:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Seems like it could be decent at first, until you see the size restrictions. As you grow in level and enemies tend to get bigger, the bonus will become more and more situational. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Combat Medic:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;You have </span><span class="c6">stabilize,</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;if you&rsquo;re truly concerned about making Heal checks in the middle of combat. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Coordinated Maneuvers:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;I&rsquo;m going to go on record as saying that perhaps 98% of Inquisitor builds should not attempt to perform combat maneuvers. The entry costs to the Improved feats are prohibitively high without the Dirty Fighting feat, and the return on investment is low. Exceptions are Ravener Hunters who take Battle Mystery&rsquo;s Maneuver Master Revelation, Inquisitors of the Crime Inquisition, and Wolf Domain Green Faith Marshals/Sacred Huntsmasters.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c46 c35">Crowd Control:</span><span>&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re like me, enemies using Acrobatics to avoid AoOs are uncommon, while enemies casting defensively are common. That being the case, Coordinated Capture can do yeoman&rsquo;s service for both scenarios, rather than focusing on Rogues or others who are going to dodge, duck, dip, dive, and dodge.</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Ferocious Loyalty:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Decent enough morale bonus for a common occurrence, but it will be quickly replaced by other morale bonuses from your spell list. Pass. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Improved Duck and Cover:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Improved, my ass. I&rsquo;ve never seen the &ldquo;improved&rdquo; version of a feat take such a left turn. No, your Rogue friend doesn&rsquo;t want to get hit by that </span><span class="c6">fireball</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;instead of you, you asshole. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Improved Precise Strike:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Not as good as its little brother, unfortunately. One point of bleed damage won&rsquo;t be raising any eyebrows.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Pack Flanking:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;INT 13 and Combat Expertise kinda kill it for this feat, despite the excellent bonus for Sacred Huntsmasters. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Spell Chain:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Good benefit; broken with Solo Tactics. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Stick Together:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;I personally don&rsquo;t think that being staggered is worth the movement, but your mileage may vary.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Swarm Scatter:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Minor buff to AC, and the bonus doesn&rsquo;t extend to all swarms, just rats. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Wounded Paw Gambit:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;I like it much more than Broken Wing Gambit, but it&rsquo;s still broken with Solo Tactics.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c24 c43">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c24 c43">&ldquo;Never stop fighting till the fight is done.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c83">&mdash;</span><span class="c24 c43">Eliot Ness, Inquisitor, U.S. Department of Justice</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c24 c107 c35 c102"></span></p><h1 class="c71" id="h.hhl9esuww0ss"><span class="c24 c75 c35">&nbsp;</span></h1><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h1 class="c71 c27" id="h.bvis7vk5gxkz"><span class="c24 c75 c35"></span></h1><h1 class="c71 c123" id="h.6mle861561x5"><span class="c24 c75 c35">INQ495: The Inquisitor&rsquo;s Arsenal</span></h1><h2 class="c18" id="h.qt6izvp2of7j"><span class="c24 c58">A Few Notes</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c28">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c19">Regarding bonus progression and &ldquo;The Big Six&rdquo;:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;I&rsquo;m of the opinion that The Big Six which Pathfinder encounters are balanced around (magic weapon, magic armor, Cloak of Resistance, Ring of Protection, Amulet of Natural Armor, and stat-boosting belt/headband) are crap, the last four especially.

This allows them to use their five newly vacated slots for all the many Wondrous Items that Pathfinder authors spend time lovingly crafting. I&rsquo;ve played at tables with and without similar rules, and without a doubt, the ones where players are allowed to wear the cool niche equipment are more fun, at least in my experience. It also looks as if Pathfinder 2e is moving toward this system, so get hip to the new vibes, cat.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c28">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c19">Regarding shields:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Inquisitors are proficient with shields, which should at the very least make them worth a look. The official Paizo ruling is that it is impossible to cast any spell with somatic components without a hand free, which means no sword-and-board loadouts allowed. Now, many tables like to houserule that light shields count as having a hand free for the purposes of spellcasting, and I&#39;m in agreement with them</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">shields are already bad enough in Pathfinder without penalizing the players who want to use them. If your GM agrees to play by those rules, I&#39;d actually recommend shields quite highly for Inquisitors: you can get +4 armor and a +3 shield for the same price as +5 armor, and there are some very useful shield enchantments out there. Much of your damage will be coming from Bane and Judgment anyway, so two-handing weapons for the STR bonus isn&#39;t as important for you as it is for, say, a Barbarian.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c28">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c19">Regarding Wondrous Items:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;There are a staggering number of mundane and wondrous items in Pathfinder, with more being added in each new supplement.

We get to keep </span><span>stalwart</span><span class="c12">, and ultimately there&rsquo;s little benefit lost in skills, movement speed, or AC.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h2 class="c62 c100" id="h.1srb9z79wgpv"><span class="c24 c104 c35 c109"></span></h2><h2 class="c18" id="h.u91cm6ib04hz"><span class="c24 c58">Armor Enchantments</span></h2><h3 class="c22" id="h.bl7e853szej3"><span class="c24 c29">The Wheat</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c24 c43">Gold-Only Enhancement Bonuses</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c20 c28">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c42">Comfort (CL 5; 5,000 gp):</span><span>&nbsp;What a nice little package of benefits! </span><span class="c64">Endure elements,</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;sleep in your armor without getting fatigued, and -1 to the ACP. Well worth the enchantment costs once you can afford it.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c42">Determination (CL 10; 30,000 gp):</span><span>&nbsp;Cue the Mario 1-UP music, because you just got an extra life. This is a wonderful enchantment that will get you back on your feet when needed most. Hope you learned </span><span class="c64">heal,</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;you poor bastard.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c42">Expeditious (CL 5; 4,000 gp):</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Enhancement bonus. Zero enhancement bonus cost for a 3/day boost to movement speed? Heck yeah, I&#39;ll take that. The swift action will compete with lots of good stuff at the beginning of combat, but if you ever need to position better or eke out that last bit of movement on a charge, here&#39;s your man.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c42">Malevolent (CL 7; 5,000 gp):</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Competence bonus. This enchantment is sky blue for anyone using a Demoralize build. After using Shatter Defenses, your opponent is flat-footed against you; that&#39;s bad enough for them, but once you start adding your armor&#39;s enhancement bonus to hit, your miss chances against demoralized enemies drop to nigh-zero.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c42">Rallying (CL 5; 5,000 gp):</span><span>&nbsp;Morale bonus. It&#39;s twice as good as </span><span class="c64">mass blessings of luck and resolve,</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;a 6th-level spell; it&#39;s always active, affects everyone within 30 feet, and doesn&#39;t use up any enhancement bonus. That&#39;s over-the-moon fantastic. Remember that your Judgments stop working if you ever become frightened or worse&mdash;you want to be passing those checks with flying colors.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c42">Restful (CL 5; 4,500 gp):</span><span>&nbsp;Crafters rejoice! This is an excellent enchantment for those who need to burn the midnight oil, and combined with </span><span class="c64">comfort</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;you can basically live in your armor. Highly recommended quality-of-life enchantment.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c20 c19"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">Corsair (CL 5; 5,000 gp):</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Competence bonus. Great for light armor builds that will be avoiding AoOs through Acrobatics.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">Creeping (CL 7; 5,000 gp):</span><span>&nbsp;You can get pretty sneaky between </span><span class="c64">creeping</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c64">shadow,</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;as long as you&#39;re willing to shell out for it. Useful if you want to sneak effectively in medium or heavy armor.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">Glamered (CL 10; 2,700 gp):</span><span>&nbsp;Cloaked Wolves are going to love this one for its ability to make them appear both unarmed and unarmored. </span><span class="c64">True seeing</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;will eventually become an issue, of course, but you&#39;ve got some time before that happens. With this costing such a reasonable amount of gold and no enhancement bonus, I say go for it if you think it will aid in your subterfuge.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">Hosteling (CL 9; 7,500 gp):</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Oh, man, Sacred Huntsmasters are going to love this. Speak the word, hide your animal companion as a symbol on your armor; speak the word again, and out they come, ready to attack. Size restrictions might put a damper on things, so ask your GM about how to make the enchantment work for you. Obviously useless for archetypes without animal companions.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">Shadow/Improved/Greater (CL 5/10/15; 3.75k/15k/33.75k gp):</span><span>&nbsp;Competence bonus, +5/+10/+15 to Stealth. Useful for Umbral Stalkers, Sanctified Slayers, and others of the Inquisitor&#39;s sneaky-stabby ilk. Inquisitors not sneaking for a living will probably prefer </span><span class="c64">creeping</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;to negate their ACP to Stealth.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c20 c19"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Amorphous (CL 8; 4,500 gp):</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Competence bonus. This enchantment functions as a slightly improved </span><span class="c6">slick,</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;with a utility power 1/day. The restriction on only supple, organic armor materials will probably scupper most Inquisitors&#39; plans of using it, however.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Deceiving (CL 7; 5,000 gp):</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;The Infiltrator archetype is your go-to for detecting as a different alignment. Unless you&#39;re trying to infiltrate enemy organizations and expect to run into Divination spells, you won&#39;t need it.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Delving (CL 5; 10,000 gp):</span><span class="c51">&nbsp;Getting a burrow speed isn&#39;t bad, though being unable to breathe underground or burrow through solid stone dampens the utility a bit. Try out the Stony Step &rarr; Oread Burrower &rarr; Oread Earth Glide line of feats if you&#39;re honestly curious about better brands of burrowing.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Mental Focus (CL 5; 3,000 gp):</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Enhancement bonus. Any perks to casting defensively are helpful; you&#39;ll probably be on the front lines and threatened quite often.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Phase Lurching (CL 13; 9,100 gp):</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;A poor man&#39;s </span><span class="c6">ethereal</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;armor. 1/day is probably too little to be worth it, but it&#39;s not nothing.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c37">Radiant</span><span class="c35">&nbsp;</span><span class="c35 c37">(CL 6; 7,500 gp):</span><span>&nbsp;Spells like </span><span class="c64">dancing lights</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c64">light</span><span>&nbsp;are nice because they don&#39;t necessarily paint a giant target on your chest that says &quot;KILL ME FIRST.&quot; 1/day </span><span class="c64">daylight</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;is cool and all, but you don&#39;t want to get your shine on everywhere you go.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c37">Righteous, Unbound, Unrighteous, Vigilant (CL 10; 27,000 gp):</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c64">Righteous might</span><span>&nbsp;is a very good spell&mdash;definitely one you should be spending a spell known on. Is a 1/day </span><span class="c64">righteous might</span><span>&nbsp;worth 27,000 gold? I&#39;d say no, but your mileage may vary. The other enchantments on this list are </span><span class="c64">righteous might</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;for chaotic, evil, and lawful PCs, respectively.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c37">Trackless (CL 5; 7,500 gp):</span><span>&nbsp;Infiltrators will be more interested in this than base Inquisitors. Being restricted to leather or hide armor lowers the utility somewhat, so you&#39;ll probably go with </span><span class="c64">shadow</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;instead.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Poison-Resistant</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c19 c21">(CL 7; 2,250 gp):</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Resistance bonus. The utility here depends on whether your GM rules that a resistance bonus vs. poison is different from (and therefore stacks with) a resistance bonus to Fort saves. If they can stack, this is </span><span class="c28 c21">green;</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;if not, </span><span class="c28 c46">red.</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Your Cloak of Resistance (or equivalent automatic bonus) &nbsp;should have you covered.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c24 c43">Variable Enhancement Bonus</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Fortification (+1 to +5):</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;These are costly enchantments, but nothing, I repeat nothing, will kill you faster than criticals or save-or-die effects at high levels. Given how easily AC is outstripped by enemies&rsquo; bonuses, you need a way to mitigate damage when it inevitably gets to you, rather than hoping it doesn&rsquo;t. </span><span class="c6">Fortification </span><span class="c12">isn&rsquo;t the sexiest effect, but it&rsquo;ll save your life.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c24 c43">+1 Enhancement Bonus</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16 c41">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Advancing (Heavy Armor only):</span><span class="c28 c42">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Excellent for battlefield mobility. You&#39;ll kill things quickly as an Inquisitor, and getting 10 feet of free movement after a kill will often set you up nicely for a full attack.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c42">Bolstering (Medium/Heavy Armor only):</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Circumstance bonus. Damage an enemy, get a free boost to your saves against that enemy&mdash;perfect for mage hunters or anyone looking to be safer on the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Assiduous (Shield only):</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;A +1 </span><span class="c6">assiduous</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;buckler will run you about 1,000 gold</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">immunity to gaze attacks is certainly worth that price to me.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c21">Blinding (Shield only):</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;It&#39;s an AoE blind effect, but</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c28">and here&#39;s the weird part</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c6">Reflex</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;negates. I bet you can think of some times when you would have loved to blind that enormous, slow-moving bruiser, but couldn&#39;t because his Fort save was through the roof. Wish no more! For a +1 bonus, this is a steal, but talk to your GM about whether you can boost the save DC in return for a higher enhancement bonus; DC 14 won&#39;t scale well into higher levels.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">Defiant:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Best in campaigns that focus on a single enemy type&mdash;Wrath of the Righteous, Carrion Crown, etc. DR 2/&mdash; isn&#39;t huge, but it&#39;s cheap and better than nothing!</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Clangorous (Shield only):</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;You get to decide the area, eh? Can I deafen everything within a mile? 100 miles? Joking aside, you&#39;re not going to want to deafen your teammates unless they have earplugs or something similar. Still, maybe a good low-level tactic, especially against casters.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Impervious:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Good against Rust Monsters or if your GM likes to sunder your equipment.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Mirrored:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">Bonuses to AC against rays and to miss chances against enemies with gaze attacks. It&#39;s versatile enough that it at least bumps up to yellow. You could couple it with the </span><span class="c6">assiduous</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;enchantment to get supreme protection from gaze attacks.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Terrain-Striding:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Useful for campaigns that tend to take place predominantly in one terrain type. A constant 10-ft. bonus to speed would be worth it on its own; the ACP negation property makes it even better.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Withstanding:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Another one that&#39;s good for campaigns focusing on a certain enemy type. Great if you&#39;re in one, mediocre if you&#39;re not.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c24 c43">+2 Enhancement Bonus</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c35 c42">Spell Dodging:</span><span>&nbsp;Dodge bonus. </span><span class="c64">Energy drain, polar ray, disintegrate&mdash;</span><span>some of the nastiest effects out there target your Touch AC, and you want none of them near you. Bonus points for giving you extra AC against summoned creatures. A must for magehunters.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">Animated (Shield only):</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;This enchantment solves the main drawback of shields: how do you get your two-handed bonuses? It can&#39;t bash or use any offensive actions, but you weren&#39;t trying to build for that, were you?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">Rampaging (Heavy Armor only):</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Ignoring difficult terrain on a charge is quite nice&mdash;adventure paths and PFS scenarios often include difficult terrain, and many enemy casters will open combat by messing with the ground in between the two sides. And fuck them, you&#39;re going over it anyway.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c20 c19"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Adamant (Heavy Armor only):</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;1/day isn&#39;t great, and even DR 3/</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;is eventually going to get outclassed. Probably not worth the +2 bonus, in the end.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Jarring:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Dazed is a hefty condition. The things hitting you in melee will probably be able to pass a DC 16 Fort save, especially as levels roll by, but still worth some consideration.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Phantasmal:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;It&#39;s a cool idea, and might find some play with Sanctified Slayers or others who need flanking in order to help them proc </span><span>sneak attack</span><span class="c12">. The phantasm&#39;s AC is abysmal, however, which means the tactic will be over as soon as they take one hit.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c24 c43">+3 Enhancement Bonus</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">Ghost Touch:</span><span>&nbsp;Costly&mdash;and potentially worth it. Incorporeals can fuck you up pretty badly with ability drain or negative levels; an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c20 c19"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Arrow-Collecting:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;20% miss chance is good. Issue is, the things that are going to kill you are exactly the things this enchantment doesn&#39;t protect you against: spells and large projectiles. Thrown weapons are out, too, so that leaves just arrows and bolts</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">not exactly a sizable group after a certain point in the bestiary. Likely not worth the enhancement bonus.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Titanic:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Enhancement bonus. Strange suite of benefits, some of them pretty nifty (Native Outsiders, for example, will love the clause about being able to use </span><span class="c6">enlarge person</span><span class="c12">). It draws a lot of attention to you, though, and Inquisitors aren&#39;t ideally suited to attracting attention. Worth +3 and a worse ACP? I&#39;d lean toward &quot;no.&quot;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c24 c43">+4 Enhancement Bonus</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19 c37">Bastion:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Mind-affecting effects will wreck you pretty hard. If </span><span>stalwart</span><span class="c28">, a high Will save, and WIS as a casting stat don&#39;t protect you, </span><span class="c6">bastion</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;is always there. It&#39;s a high price to pay, though, so not many will use it.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c24 c43">+5 Enhancement Bonus</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Dread Wing:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;+5 bonus, indeed: a fly speed and two natural attacks are worth getting excited about. It&#39;ll cost you, though.</span></p><h3 class="c67" id="h.24kjelec657z"><span class="c24 c70 c104 c35">&nbsp;</span></h3><h3 class="c22" id="h.hp7vllb5kfel"><span class="c24 c29">The Chaff</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c24 c43">Gold-Only Enhancement Bonuses</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c28 c41 c46">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Adhesive (CL 10; 7,000 gp):</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Enhancement bonus. You won&#39;t be using maneuvers, so that part of the enchantment is worthless. The climb speed is easily replicated by </span><span class="c6">spider climb</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;or similar spells, and at only 10 rounds/day, I can&#39;t recommend it.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Buoyant (CL 5; 1,000 gp for light armor; 2,000 gp for medium and heavy):</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Maybe for Skull &amp; Shackles? ACPs when swimming won&#39;t come up in 99% of scenarios.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Burdenless (CL 5; 4,000 gp):</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">Ant haul,</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;a wagon and team, Muleback Cords, a Handy Haversack</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">if your group uses encumbrance rules, you&#39;ve got better ways of dealing with excess weight.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Channeling (CL 8; 18,000 gp):</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;You can&#39;t channel.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Cushioned (CL 1; 1,000 gp):</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Not many armors fit the bill, and it&#39;s a minor benefit. What were you expecting for 1,000 gold?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Energy Resistance/Improved/Greater (CL 3/7/11; 18k/42k/66k gp):</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">Resist energy</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;is a 2nd-level spell that you&#39;ll probably have known. You need the versatility of being able to select which element you&#39;re resisting, unless you&#39;re playing an element-specific campaign like Reign of Winter or Legacy of Fire.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Harmonizing (CL 7; 15,000 gp):</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Fun for Bards, not for Batman. Pass.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Jousting (CL 5; 3,750 gp):</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Competence bonus. Scant few Inquisitors will go for mounted combat.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Locksmith (CL 3; 6,500 gp):</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Enhancement bonus. You can&#39;t do much with this, but for Rogues, Ninjas, or other dedicated trap-finders, this is </span><span class="c28 c41 c42">blue.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Martyring (CL 9; 18,000 gp):</span><span class="c28 c42">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">A wand of </span><span class="c6">cure light wounds</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;costs 750 gold for 50 charges, or 15 gold/charge. The Martyring enchantment costs 18,000 gold. You do the math.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Putrid (CL 5; 10,000 gp):</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Your teammates will murder you in your sleep if your armor accidentally sickens them for 5 rounds in combat. Don&#39;t purchase this.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Radiant Flight (CL 10; 15,000 gp; Heavy Armor only):</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">Between your poor maneuverability and heavy ACP to Fly, you&#39;re going to have a tough time staying aloft. The 10-minute/day duration kills it dead</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">useless for both combat and travel.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Slick/Improved/Greater (CL 4/10/15 ; 3.75k/15k/33.75k gp):</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Competence bonus, +5/+10/+15 to Escape Artist.

Losing Monster Lore isn&#39;t great for most Inquisitor archetypes, because WIS remains their casting stat; for your new INT focus and associated increase in skill ranks, it&#39;s no big deal</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">you basically get Weapon Focus (Grimoire) as a free feat. The only reason this isn&rsquo;t rated higher is because the Holy Book is treated as a light mace, and you don&rsquo;t get your 1.5x STR bonus to damage for two-handing light weapons when Power Attacking (/u/rekijan points out that this makes the Holy Book less OP than previously thought).</span></li><li class="c7 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c16">Spells:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Alters spellcasting and replaces Cunning Initiative. You become a prepared spellcaster (!) who uses INT as your casting and domain stat, essentially turning you into a divine wizard. Everybody&rsquo;s got a different preference as far as prepared/spontaneous goes, so this might be a good or a bad thing, depending. I tend to think of it as a good thing</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">there are enough decent niche spells on the Inquisitor list that I could foresee wanting some of them at hand.</span></li><li class="c7 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c16">Sacred Word:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Replaces Judgment. You&#39;ll lose Bane and </span><span>greater bane</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;down the line, but that&#39;s okay, because Sacred Word takes its place. You get the Warpriest&#39;s Sacred Weapon ability (which is awesome, by the way) along with the ability to add </span><span class="c6">bane</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;and other effects to your book. Scaling damage dice help adjust your book&rsquo;s damage for the loss of two-handed STR bonuses.

There are two components to this ability: first, you can prepare the tattooed spells without your holy book, and second, you can cast them as spell-like abilities 1/day. SLAs can be cast without material, somatic, or verbal components, so when we think about which spells should go into the tattoo slots, we immediately see that these were intended to be &quot;panic button&quot; spells</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c6">invisibility, dispel magic, freedom of movement,</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;the like. If you think about which spells you&#39;d want if you were stripped of your grimoire and gear, then gagged and imprisoned, you&#39;ll be in the right ballpark.</span></li><li class="c7 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c19 c21">Word of God:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Replaces True Judgment, although it&#39;s not actually a replacement.

With the loss of Cunning Initiative, Judgment, and your WIS focus, a Living Grimoire won&#39;t play like your garden-variety Inquisitor, but I think it&#39;s well worth the trade. An INT focus turns you into even more of a skill monster and compensates for your loss of Monster Lore; meanwhile, prepared spellcasting ensures that you&#39;re much more versatile when you need to be. Sacred Word scales your base damage with your level, and also allows you to put </span><span class="c6">bane</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;on your book as a base Inquisitor can. That&#39;s nothing but upshot.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="c22" id="h.s51m805b7udp"><span class="c42">Monster Tactician</span><span class="c24 c29">&nbsp;(Monster Summoner&#39;s Handbook)</span></h3><p class="c7"><span class="c38">What&#39;s the niche?</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c7 c48"><span class="c12">Another day, another meat shield: an Inquisitor who summons monsters instead of pronouncing judgment.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c24 c38 c51">What you&rsquo;re getting</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c12"></span></p><ul class="c44 lst-kix_rtwkbxyhxk6z-0 start"><li class="c7 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c16">Summon Monster:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Replaces Judgment.

Summon Monster is one of those ideal abilities that gives you both increased power and unparalleled versatility: if you know the templates of the creatures you have available, you&#39;ll never lack for a tactically perfect battle companion.</span></li><li class="c7 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c16">Summon Tactics:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Replaces </span><span class="c6">discern lies,</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;</span><span>second judgment</span><span class="c28">, </span><span>third judgment</span><span class="c12">, Slayer, and True Judgment.

Between your WIS focus and this ability, you just became the best Perception jockey in the entire game, bar none.

Favored Enemy is an extremely powerful ability, but as with the Ranger, you&#39;re limited by which enemies you&#39;re fighting. One cool trick that Samsaran Inquisitors can pull is to use the Mystic Past Life alternative racial trait to pick up </span><span class="c6">instant enemy</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;from the Ranger spell list.

Hunter or Druid guides will help you select your animal companion; some make better tanks, strikers, etc., and which you choose will depend on your party composition and the role your buddy expects to play in combat.

Hunter Tactics singlehandedly solves the two essential problems with Teamwork feats: first, how do you convince your teammates to get the same feats you do; and second, how do you convince them to change their tactics to activate those feats? With this ability, your companion gets all your feats</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">and you control their tactics. So if you want to flank, flank, and if you want to fight side by side, fight side by side! Hunter Tactics gives you the latitude to play around.</span></li><li class="c7 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c16">Animal Focus:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Replaces all later iterations of Judgment. Woo woooooo, the blue train keeps on rolling! Animal Focus is a great class feature, and you get it as the Hunter, which means that your animal companion gets a constant focus, and you qualify for feats like Extended Animal Focus and Planar Focus. You can really do some cool stuff with this ability. My thoughts on the foci are detailed below:</span></li></ul><ul class="c44 lst-kix_suvi6vr68li-1 start"><li class="c7 c25 li-bullet-0"><span class="c19 c37">Air:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Requires the Planar Focus feat. You won&#39;t need it much of the time, but you&#39;ll be glad to have it when your Broom of Flying gets destroyed in mid-air or that Hill Giant bull rushes you off a cliff. Ask your DM whether you can choose between </span><span class="c6">feather fall</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c6">levitate</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;when you activate this focus</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c28">they serve different purposes, and RAW </span><span class="c6">levitate</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;replaces </span><span class="c6">feather fall</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;at later levels.</span></li><li class="c7 c25 li-bullet-0"><span class="c19 c37">Bat:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Obviously </span><span class="c28 c21">better for humans</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;and</span><span class="c28 c46">&nbsp;fairly useless for races with innate Darkvision.</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;If your DM rules that it can be used to improve upon existing innate Darkvision, it becomes </span><span class="c28 c42">blue.</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;The blindsense is ultimately mediocre, unfortunately.</span></li><li class="c7 c25 li-bullet-0"><span class="c19 c21">Bear:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Enhancement bonus. A good focus that loses steam quickly, thanks to the incompatibility of its bonus type with physical stat belts. Also watch out for what happens to those extra HP when you switch foci</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c28">wouldn&#39;t want you to drop dead because you stopped cosplaying as the grizzly from </span><span class="c6 c55">The Revenant.</span></li><li class="c7 c25 li-bullet-0"><span class="c19 c21">Bull:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Enhancement bonus. Same basic pros and cons as Bear Focus.</span></li><li class="c7 c25 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Chaotic:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Requires the Planar Focus feat and a Chaotic alignment. Negating all critical and precision damage might have been worth glancing at. Negating it only a quarter of the time? +1 </span><span class="c6">Fortification</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;armor can do that. Pass.</span></li><li class="c7 c25 li-bullet-0"><span class="c19 c37">Cold:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Requires the Planar Focus feat. It&#39;s a small amount of damage, sure, but you don&#39;t have to get hit for it to work, only attacked, and it doesn&#39;t allow for any kind of save for half.</span></li><li class="c7 c25 li-bullet-0"><span class="c19 c21">Earth:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Requires the Planar Focus feat. Novel movement type plus a bump to natural armor? Yeah, why not? Versatility is the name of the game.</span></li><li class="c7 c25 li-bullet-0"><span class="c19 c37">Evil:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Requires the Planar Focus feat and an Evil alignment. Profane bonus. The boost to AC is small; saves are more interesting. Still, profane bonuses are hard to come by, so...meh? Might be worth throwing out if you&#39;re fighting Good Outsiders.</span></li><li class="c7 c25 li-bullet-0"><span class="c19 c21">Falcon:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">Competence bonus. Can always find a use for more Perception, but it won&#39;t stack with </span><span class="c6">heightened awareness, bloodhound,</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;or </span><span class="c6 c55">perceive cues.</span></li><li class="c7 c25 li-bullet-0"><span class="c16">Fire:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;This is really what </span><span class="c6">flaming</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;weapons should have been</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c28">scaling damage boosts. By the time you get Bane at 5th level, Fire Focus will give you +1d6, and by the time you get </span><span>greater bane</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;at 12th level, that will have increased to +3d6. </span><span class="c6">And Bane and Fire Aspect stack.</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;You heard that right. Resistances will obviously bedevil you from time to time, but overall this is a fantastic damage boost for melee &lsquo;Quisitors.</span></li><li class="c7 c25 li-bullet-0"><span class="c19 c37">Frog:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Competence bonus. You won&#39;t be using these skills much, but hey, the option&#39;s nice to have.</span></li><li class="c7 c25 li-bullet-0"><span class="c19 c37">Good:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Requires the Planar Focus feat and a Good alignment. Sacred bonus. See Evil Aspect.</span></li><li class="c7 c25 li-bullet-0"><span class="c19 c37">Lawful:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">Requires the Planar Focus feat and a Lawful alignment. Just shrug off that </span><span class="c6">baleful polymorph</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;like it ain&#39;t no thang. Maybe talk to your GM about whether you could shift to this focus as an immediate action if you use Spellcraft to identify a transmutation spell as it&rsquo;s being cast.</span></li><li class="c7 c25 li-bullet-0"><span class="c19 c37">Monkey:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Competence bonus. Another circumstantial one.</span></li><li class="c7 c25 li-bullet-0"><span class="c16">Mouse:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">Ooh, now this is interesting. Evasion and </span><span>i</span><span class="c28">mproved </span><span>evasion</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;make you a regular tank against certain types of spells and enemies (lookin&rsquo; at you, Dragons) so don&#39;t be afraid to abuse this.</span></li><li class="c7 c25 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Owl:</span><span class="c28 c46">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">Competence bonus. This is a decent focus for a stealthy animal companion, but for you, the </span><span class="c6">shadow</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;armor enchantment will provide a better bonus as a constant effect. If you&rsquo;re looking for stealth, consider Shadow Focus for its untyped bonus.</span></li><li class="c7 c25 li-bullet-0"><span class="c19 c21">Shadow:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Requires the Planar Focus feat. Untyped bonus. Ah, much better. That bonus will stack with everything, and pairs wonderfully with the Stealth Synergy teamwork feat if your companion is also using the aspect.</span></li><li class="c7 c25 li-bullet-0"><span class="c19 c21">Snake:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Untyped bonus. Excellent when paired with a reach weapon or a crowded battlefield.</span></li><li class="c7 c25 li-bullet-0"><span class="c19 c37">Stag:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Enhancement bonus. Doesn&#39;t stack with Boots of Striding and Springing, </span><span class="c6">expeditious retreat,</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;or any other enhancement bonus to movement speed. If you don&#39;t have those, by all means, bound away.</span></li><li class="c7 c25 li-bullet-0"><span class="c19 c21">Tiger:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Enhancement bonus. Oddly enough, Tiger is likely to be your physical stat Aspect of choice: it improves your touch AC, shores up your weak Reflex save, gives you more AoOs with Combat Reflexes, and likely won&#39;t be covered by your Belt slot for a considerable portion of your career. Look into ways to improve the maximum DEX bonus of your armor, e.g. through mithral.</span></li><li class="c7 c25 li-bullet-0"><span class="c16">Water:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Requires the Planar Focus feat. Beats the pants off of Frog Aspect by giving you a swim speed and the ability to breathe water. You won&#39;t be doing it all day, of course, but if you&#39;re like me you hate leaving tools out of the toolbox.</span></li><li class="c7 c25 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Wolf:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Useful as an early-game replacement for </span><span class="c6">see invisibility,</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Wolf Focus quickly gets outclassed by </span><span class="c6">bloodhound</span><span class="c64">&mdash;</span><span class="c12">the range on this ability is just way too short.</span></li></ul><ul class="c44 lst-kix_suvi6vr68li-0"><li class="c7 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c19 c21">Improved Empathic Link:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Replaces </span><span>second judgment</span><span class="c28">. Being able to see through the eyes of your animal companion is a great deal, especially if you&rsquo;re not great at sneaking. Be careful not to send companions too far ahead, though</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">you don&rsquo;t want them rolling for initiative alone.</span></li><li class="c7 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c19 c37">Raise Animal</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c19 c37">Companion:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">Replaces </span><span>third judgment</span><span class="c12">. Do try not to let Fido die, alright? At least if you do, you&#39;ve got this. The negative level is, thankfully, temporary.</span></li><li class="c7 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c16">Second Animal Focus:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Replaces Slayer. You get this very late in the game, but more Animal Foci never, ever hurt. It enables some interesting combos: Tiger + Mouse turns you into a Reflex save god; Tiger + Snake, into an AoO whirlwind; Owl + Shadow, into a professional sneaker; Fire + Cold, into a punishing melee damage machine; Stag + Earth or Water, into a dauntless pursuer; Bat + Wolf, into an extrasensory specialist. Play around with it, see what you like.</span></li><li class="c7 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c19 c37">Greater Empathic Link:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Replaces True Judgment.

Sanctified Slayer says you get studied target as a Slayer of the same level, which then kicks you over to the studied target text on the Slayer&rsquo;s page. It reads: &ldquo;The DCs of Slayer class abilities against that opponent increase by 1.&rdquo; There are two schools of thought about what that sentence means:</span></li></ul><ul class="c44 lst-kix_omqvh4s1p1n7-1 start"><li class="c7 c25 li-bullet-0"><span class="c35">Pro:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Spells are an Inquisitor class ability; hence, spells benefit from studied target.</span></li><li class="c7 c25 li-bullet-0"><span class="c35">Con:</span><span>&nbsp;Ah, but here&rsquo;s the thing: Sanctified Slayer doesn&rsquo;t make any exception for applying those increases in save DCs to </span><span class="c64">Inquisitor</span><span>&nbsp;abilities. It gives you the Slayer&rsquo;s version of studied target, which states that only </span><span class="c64">Slayer</span><span>&nbsp;class abilities get boosted. Slayers have no spells; hence, spells don&rsquo;t benefit from studied target. In the time since I first wrote this guide, I&rsquo;ve come to favor this interpretation. It&rsquo;s truer to RAW, and it eases the absolutely busted power curve that the archetype has if you give it boosted spell save DCs. I mean, come on, do you really need studied target, sneak attack, Slayer talents, </span><span class="c64">and</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;humongous boosts to all your spell save DCs?

Quite strong.</span></li><li class="c7 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c16">Defense Against Magic:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Replaces all Teamwork feats. Great ability that really amps up your &quot;Screw you&quot; attitude toward casters. Necromancy and Evocation should probably be your first picks for schools due to their ability to straight-up murder you. Enchantment and Illusion come in a bare second; although mind-affecting spells are by far the most dangerous on any spell list, you also get to roll twice on every save with that descriptor</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">thanks to Strong-Willed, you&#39;re safer than most. Conjuration spells can be deadly, but usually have no save or target AC. The Divination and Transmutation schools are more annoying and inconvenient than anything else, putting them in fifth and sixth place.

The main draw here is that it stacks with the Disruptive feat and a </span><span class="c6">distracting</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;weapon for a potential -8 penalty to defensive casting. It&#39;s starting to get reeeeeeal hard for casters to make those Concentration checks, especially if they were foolish enough not to pick up Combat Casting.</span></li></ul><ul class="c44 lst-kix_w6zmsbx0n04q-1 start"><li class="c7 c25 li-bullet-0"><span class="c12">As a math example, we&#39;ll use your worst-case-scenario enemy as a spellbreaker: an arcane caster who does nothing but specialize in casting, say, a Level 10 Wizard. He had 20 INT at the beginning of the game, then dumped his 4th- and 8th-level attribute increases into INT. His +4 INT headband gives him some extra leeway, for a total of 26 INT.</span></li><li class="c7 c25 li-bullet-0"><span class="c12">1st-Level Spell: DC 15 + 2(1st-Level) = 17 to successfully cast defensively.

Add 10% to the failure chance each spell level thereafter, to a maximum of 30% for a 5th-Level spell.</span></li><li class="c7 c25 li-bullet-0"><span class="c28">Now that same Wizard faces an Inquisitor with Disruptive, Foil Casting, and a </span><span class="c6">distracting </span><span class="c12">weapon. At this point, it&#39;s getting less and less likely that even this highly specialized enemy will be able to avoid losing the spell and its action.</span></li><li class="c7 c25 li-bullet-0"><span class="c28">1st-Level Spell: DC 15 + 2(1st-Level) = 17 to successfully cast defensively.

Check succeeds on a roll of 7 or higher, for a 30% failure chance. Add 10% to the failure chance each spell level, to a maximum of 70% for a 5th-Level spell.</span></li><li class="c7 c25 li-bullet-0"><span class="c28">The probabilities speak for themselves: against most characters, a Wizard can cast 1st- and 2nd-level spells defensively without worrying about a thing; against your Inquisitor, though, even the simplest spell has a 30% chance of failing, and by the time we get up to their highest available spell level, they&#39;re fumbling 70% of the time. As I said, this is also your worst-case scenario</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">against enemies that invested less in their casting stat, are lower level than you, or dipped a non-casting class, you&#39;re doing even better.</span></li></ul><ul class="c44 lst-kix_w6zmsbx0n04q-0"><li class="c7 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c19 c21">Impervious:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Replaces True Judgment.

Yeah, here&#39;s where Slayer&#39;s Brand actually gets good. As levels go by and you can pass up more Teamwork feats for Brand upgrades, the ability gets better and better: make it a ranged touch attack, make it affect anything Evil, make it affect two targets at once, make it hit harder, make it impose penalties on the enemy. It takes a long time to get rolling, but there&#39;s also no limit on how many times per day you can use it, and no limit on how many times it can affect one target. Hell, after a certain point you could be making ranged touch attacks against Undead and Evil enemies all day.

Occultists can only learn spells that belong to one of their implement schools, so Relic Hunters need to think carefully about which roles they intend to play in the group and then choose their implement schools accordingly. This feature forces the Inquisitor, already something of a specialist caster, into an even more niche spellcasting role.

You&rsquo;re ultimately sacrificing all your damage-dealing potential for fewer Occultist tricks than an Occultist has.

Monster Lore, Cunning Initiative, and Domain abilities &nbsp;are all keyed off of stats rather than class level, making them ideal features to give to a WIS-heavy martial class like Brawler, Monk, or even Ranger. Those without any innate casting of their own will appreciate the few orisons and 1st-level spells young Inquisitors get, as well as the suite of alignment detection tools that kick in at 2nd level.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as dipping from Inquisitor into other classes goes, the reasons why you might choose to do so are numerous, and the methods of doing so are even more numerous than that. Your dip choices will be guided by your build goals, so I can offer you only a few pieces of universal advice. First, casters get disadvantaged by multiclassing more severely than martial classes do, so do what you need to in another class and then get out. The Bane Baldric item can help you progress your Bane rounds back to normal levels, and the Magical Knack trait (tacky though it is) grants you a +2 trait bonus to caster level, ensuring that your SR penetration, etc. don&rsquo;t fall too terribly behind. Second, look for features that are either granted without any caveats at all or that scale with attributes, not class level. Dips are meant to snag you feats and low-hanging class abilities, so go for the stuff that will give you the most for your sacrifice of Inquisitor levels.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">A short list of common dips:</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><ul class="c44 lst-kix_20pl8lbfcgib-0 start"><li class="c7 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c19">Fighter X:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;You&rsquo;re here for feats, BAB, and weapon/armor proficiencies.

Unfortunately, the price that VMC exacts in exchange for your secondary class&rsquo; features is your feat selection at 3rd, 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th levels. For some classes that get multiple bonus feats (usually full-martial classes like Fighter, Brawler, Monk, Ranger, etc.) this is an excellent trade, as a feat or two lost won&rsquo;t break the bank in the grand scheme of things. Inquisitors are different creatures, however, with zero bonus combat feats. DEX-to-damage? Impossible until at least 9th level. Basic Power Attack? Impossible until 5th level. Forced to bet the odds on an attempt to walk across the Pacific Ocean rather or an attempt to build a workable ranged Inquisitor VMC, I&rsquo;d bet the former outcome every time. Given how weak the VMC abilities are overall and how much of your combat effectiveness you have to sacrifice in order to VMC, there&rsquo;s no real choice here. Wish I could recommend it, but if you want a non-gimped character, don&rsquo;t VMC.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="c18" id="h.k1ro5w27869f"><span class="c24 c58">Prestige Classes</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say, I&rsquo;m a sucker for Prestige Classes. They get a lot of flack from the community at large, understandably so: when your character&rsquo;s effectiveness in-game is largely determined by class level, taking a 10-level detour out of your starting class to pick up a flavorful yet mechanically weak set of abilities just doesn&rsquo;t make sense. And yet, PrCs are great petri dishes for classes based on specialized organizations, regions, or religions; they&rsquo;re proving grounds for creative mechanics and unlikely melanges of classes. Perhaps most importantly, PrCs give us a means of pumping the brakes on our own power curve as PCs. Why would we want to do that? To spare your GM the massive headaches that can come from trying to balance encounters against a party full of PCs who are min-maxed to the gills, for one, or maybe just because characters with flaws are often more interesting than characters without them. Whatever the reason you go Prestige, you&rsquo;ll want to try to strike a balance between meeting the entry requirements, getting something out of the class, and not giving up too much from Inquisitor. We&rsquo;ve got a couple of different tacks to try as we accomplish those goals.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><ul class="c44 lst-kix_b60jjstrenmh-0 start"><li class="c7 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c19">Streamlining entry requirements.</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Skills are usually easy to come by as an Inquisitor; our list is good and we get plenty of ranks per level. Feats, proficiencies, and either BAB or spellcasting are a bit harder, and might delay your entry. Special requirements such as the Gray Gardener&rsquo;s public trial and execution will have to be undertaken with your GM&rsquo;s permission anyway, so there&rsquo;s not much lost there. At any rate, we&rsquo;ll favor PrCs that we can get into using mostly skills and one or two feats.</span></li><li class="c7 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c19">Maximizing your gains.</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;We want PrCs that shore up the Inquisitor&rsquo;s mechanical weaknesses.

Some PrCs allow you to advance your Inquisitor levels to some degree, whether greater (Evangelist, e.g.) or lesser (Chernasardo Warden, e.g.). A greater number will advance your spellcasting, but not your class features. Many PrCs will not advance anything from your base class, leaving you in anguish, wallowing in freakish misery forever. The Magical Knack trait will help with CL, and the Favored Prestige Class/Prestigious Spellcaster feats can ease some of the pain of spellcasting, although let&rsquo;s be honest, who wants to burn two feats for one level of casting?</span></li></ul><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="c67" id="h.cww5t88suez7"><span class="c70 c35 c37">Aspis Agent</span><span class="c24 c70 c104 c35">&nbsp;(Paths of Prestige)</span></h3><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c24 c38 c51"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c24 c38 c51">What&#39;s the niche?</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c24 c38 c51"></span></p><p class="c7 c48"><span class="c28">Professional treasure hunters who are great in a dungeon crawl</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">and great at concealing their true intentions.

(Thanks to /u/kuzcoburra for pointing out this excellent PrC choice!)</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c24 c38 c51">Where and how do we enter?</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c24 c38 c51"></span></p><p class="c7 c48"><span class="c28">Expulsionists will get </span><span>Alignment</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Channel, 1st-level spells, and Channel Energy as features at 1st level, and 5 ranks in Knowledge (Religion) shouldn&rsquo;t be a stretch at all. After that, it&rsquo;s simply a matter of waiting for BAB to catch up until we can enter at 8th level.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c24 c38 c51">How far do we go?</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c7 c48"><span class="c28">If you&rsquo;re not grabbed by the PrC as a whole, </span><span class="c19">Holy Vindicator 1</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;nets you Vindicator&rsquo;s Shield, an easy buff to AC that squishy Inquisitors should be interested in; because it scales with Channel dice rather than class level, it&rsquo;s by far the easiest dip. For those who savor the flavor, </span><span class="c19">Holy Vindicator 5</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;gets you Channel Smite and Bloodfire for some offensive oomph, while </span><span class="c19">Holy Vindicator 6 </span><span class="c28">lets you activate your Stigmata as a move action. At </span><span class="c19">Holy Vindicator 8,</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;all your self-targeted heals are Maximized, and at </span><span class="c19">Holy Vindicator 10 </span><span class="c28">you get swift action Stigmata and the ability to cast </span><span class="c6">bestow curse</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;on anyone you crit or anyone who crits you. Yeah, HV starts nice and gets nasty fast.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c24 c38 c51">What you&#39;re getting</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c24 c38 c51"></span></p><ul class="c44 lst-kix_ke8esfbvmx1h-0 start"><li class="c7 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c19 c21">Proficiencies:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Free martial weapon and heavy armor proficiency! It&rsquo;s perfect for the tankier playstyle of a HV.</span></li><li class="c7 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c19 c21">Vindicator&rsquo;s</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c16">Shield:</span><span class="c28 c42">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">At the very least, it&rsquo;s a Sacred bonus to AC that scales with your Channels, which will improve at every odd level. I wish we had some clarification about a few of the caveats, though: for instance, the text doesn&rsquo;t specifically state that you expend a use of Channel Energy when using the ability, although that might be implied; likewise, the text doesn&rsquo;t make me 100% clear on whether you need to be carrying or wielding the shield in order to activate the ability. It&rsquo;s not a Shield bonus, so I&rsquo;d be inclined to rule that you could be carrying the shield on your back or something. At any rate, it&rsquo;s hefty protection, at least until you get hit.</span></li><li class="c7 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c16">Stigmata:</span><span class="c28 c42">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">In return for unstaunchable bleed damage, you get a bonus equal to half your HV level to AC, saves, to-hit, damage, or CL checks. The power here can&rsquo;t be overstated: Stigmata (AC) + Vindicator&rsquo;s Shield will turn you into an untouchable tank; to-hit and damage let you murder things very efficiently; and CL checks can be used to supplement SR penetration rolls. You&rsquo;ll also enjoy this ability for the immunity to other sources of bleed damage it confers.</span></li><li class="c7 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c19 c21">Faith </span><span class="c16">Healing:</span><span class="c28 c42">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">This Warpriest-esque ability is what allows you to keep rolling despite taking all that bleed damage. Self-healing will always be either Empowered or Maximized without increasing spell level or casting time, which, ya know, is amazing. The ability appears not to apply to wands, as it specifically calls out spells that the HV casts.</span></li><li class="c7 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Divine Wrath:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">Doom </span><span class="c12">isn&rsquo;t a good spell for this level, so you likely won&rsquo;t use this ability much, if at all.</span></li><li class="c7 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c19 c21">Bloodfire:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;The damage from your Channel Smite is starting to stack up pretty fast, no? HVs who channel negative energy actually have the advantage here, as their Smite can be used on any living creature, whereas HVs who channel positive energy are restricted to Undead.</span></li><li class="c7 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c19 c37">Versatile Channel:</span><span class="c28 c37">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Minor benefit, but not nothing.</span></li><li class="c7 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c19 c21">Divine Judgment:</span><span class="c28 c21">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">Death knell</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;is much better</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">cast it as an immediate action on a mook you knock below 0 HP, and you&rsquo;ll be set up nicely for the rest of the fight.</span></li><li class="c7 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c19 c37">Bloodrain:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;You can now attempt to sicken and bleed all enemies within your Channel radius. Will the save DC ever be high enough to make it? Probably not at this level, but you&rsquo;re bound to catch a few bad saves. Bloodfire gets the slightly higher rating because the action economy of Channel Smite is better and you still get weapon damage even if the enemy passes their save.</span></li><li class="c7 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c19 c21">Divine </span><span class="c16">Retribution:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">Bestow curse</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;is a fitting capstone to the class, and you&rsquo;ll have far more 3rd-level spells to sacrifice than your Paladin brethren. Even if an attack incapacitates or kills you, you can still flip the magical bird as you go down in a bath of divine energy and blood. Cool stuff.</span></li></ul><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c24 c38 c51">Is it worth it?</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c24 c38 c51"></span></p><p class="c7 c48"><span class="c28">If you&rsquo;re looking for a grim, bloody, Paladin-lite martial character who can dish out some serious damage, bleed effects, and debuffs, look no further.

Getting rewarded with </span><span class="c6">death knell</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c6">bestow curse</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;is a fun incentive to stick with it.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c12"></span></p><h3 class="c67" id="h.t8rj3pvfurvk"><span class="c70 c35 c37">Master</span><span class="c14 c70">&nbsp;Spy</span><span class="c24 c70 c104 c35">&nbsp;(Advanced Player&rsquo;s Guide)</span></h3><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c24 c38 c51"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c24 c38 c51">What&#39;s the niche?</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c24 c38 c51"></span></p><p class="c7 c48"><span class="c28">An infiltrator </span><span class="c6">par excellence</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;who supplements mundane Disguise checks with alignment-altering magic.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c24 c38 c51">Where and how do we enter?</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c24 c38 c51"></span></p><p class="c7 c48"><span class="c12">The feat taxes are unfortunate, but skills are always easy for Inquisitors.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c24 c38 c51">How far do we go?</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c7 c48"><span class="c19">Master Spy 2</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;gives you the basic ability to conceal your alignment, an excellent ability for undercover Inquisitors or the Infiltrator archetype; </span><span class="c19">Master Spy 5</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;sees the advent of constant </span><span class="c6">nondetection</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;and the Rogue&rsquo;s Slippery Mind class feature; </span><span class="c19">Master Spy 9</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;and its constant </span><span class="c6">mind blank</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;are basically an &ldquo;I win&rdquo; button against [mind-affecting] and divination magic, but 9 levels is a looong time to follow Master Spy.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c24 c38 c51">What you&#39;re getting</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c24 c38 c51"></span></p><ul class="c44 lst-kix_10ri0vn1j09m-0 start"><li class="c7 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c19 c21">Art of Deception:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Inquisitors are pretty deceptive already, and the Master Spy ratchets that up to 11.

The Noble Scion feat is your other option; Scion of Peace and Scion of Lore are likely the most inquisitorial options, but </span><span class="c6">Heroes of the High Court</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;introduced some others that are worth considering, most notably using your DEX or CON score in place of CHA for determining the effects of the Leadership feat.

Leadership needs no introduction to most PF players, but for the uninitiated: Leadership is the strongest feat in the game because it essentially allows you to attract your own army of NPCs. You get a Cohort who&rsquo;s close in level to you and can take class levels, and at later levels start to attract hordes of weaker Followers who perform grunt work, Aid Another on skill checks, churn out goods for you using Cooperative Crafting, etc. GMs are predisposed not to like the feat because it&rsquo;s a </span><span class="c6">tremendous </span><span class="c28">amount of bookkeeping and busts the already-somewhat-broken power curve of the game unless it&rsquo;s done </span><span class="c6">very</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;carefully. If you want to prevent it from being banned in your game, you need to plan well ahead of time with your GM about steps that you&rsquo;re going to take in order not to destroy the game that they so lovingly crafted.

Your cohort can shore up pretty much any weaknesses, depending on what class levels you give them (lost your casting? Why not Wizard levels?) and your followers can super boost you by dint of Aid Another actions alone. Do it!

Blessings of Darkness just lets those levels stack, which is nice for unlocking your second domain ability.</span></li><li class="c7 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c19 c21">Tenebrous Magic:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Free +1 to spell save DCs and CL while in dim light or lower. Why not? You&rsquo;re still not reliably able to shut down enemies&rsquo; saves, but it never hurts.</span></li><li class="c7 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c19 c21">Umbral Courtier:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Lots of untyped skill bonuses. Yummy wummy.</span></li><li class="c7 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c19 c21">Darkvision:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;As with Shadowdancer, darkvision is integral to this playstyle. Try to enter as a race with innate darkvision so you get nothing but benefit.</span></li><li class="c7 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c16">Shadow Chains:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Here&rsquo;s where UCA starts to go off the rails! Entangled is a great condition, limiting mobility, decreasing AC, dropping to-hit and DEX-based skill checks, and forcing concentration checks for casters</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">this on top of the 20% miss chance that Touch of Darkness already grants.

I think it would be considerably better as a class if it were attainable by 6th level, allowing you to reach the meat of the PrC before literally every foe is a high-level caster. That said, I friggin&rsquo; </span><span class="c6">adore</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;the flavor, having always like the cut of Zon-Kuthon&rsquo;s jib, and you&rsquo;ve got some nice synergies between Unnerving Gaze and Touch of Darkness that should help soften enemies considerably for your teammates.</span></p><h2 class="c62" id="h.vd2ugqcxqdd3"><span class="c24 c104 c35 c109">&nbsp;</span></h2><h2 class="c62" id="h.i1azkjiz5d8s"><span class="c24 c104 c35 c109">Gestalt Builds</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c48"><span class="c28">Gestalt character creation is a process that essentially combines all the class features and casting capabilities of two classes, and is typically done when PCs need to be extra powerful, as when an adventure path designed for a four-person party is only being run by two PCs.</span><span class="c28"><a class="c40" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.d20srd.org/srd/variant/classes/gestaltCharacters.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117385719000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1HrgtqsCMf9t4CYTuc8Ofy">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="c78 c28"><a class="c40" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.d20srd.org/srd/variant/classes/gestaltCharacters.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611117385719000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1HrgtqsCMf9t4CYTuc8Ofy">Complete rules can be found here.</a></span><span class="c12">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s not terribly difficult to pick a gestalt class, because anything you choose isn&rsquo;t a trade-off so much as an addition. That said, there are choices that maximize what the Inquisitor already has, so in this section we&rsquo;ll detail general precepts for what you should be looking out for in a gestalt pairing.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><ul class="c44 lst-kix_a8tbugghqlqu-0 start"><li class="c7 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c28">First and foremost, </span><span class="c19">we&rsquo;re looking for a partner class that benefits from a high WIS score. </span><span class="c12">The point buy rules at your table may vary, but many GMs will not budge on 20-point buy, which means that you have to find a class that makes the most of the stats that you&rsquo;ll already be boosting: STR or DEX, CON, WIS, and (to a much lesser extent) CHA.</span></li><li class="c7 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c28">Second, </span><span class="c19">our partner class should patch the Inquisitor&rsquo;s weaknesses.</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;A d8 hit die is one such weakness; weak Reflex saves, &frac34; BAB, &frac34; casting, and the absence of bonus combat feats might be other areas to consider shoring up.</span></li><li class="c7 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c28">Third and lastly,</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;we should try to capitalize on the Inquisitor&rsquo;s strengths.</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Inquisitors are burst damage specialists who already have an enormous number of incentives to flank</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c28">should we go for an Unchained Rogue gestalt for </span><span>sneak attack</span><span class="c28">? Inquisitors have excellent Intimidate potential</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c28">should we go for a Menacing Combat Style Ranger, who can grant us free combat feats in that arena? Inquisitors get a whole bunch of Teamwork feats for free</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">perhaps Cavalier, to grant all of them to our teammates? Once you&rsquo;ve isolated what you believe to be the Inquisitor&rsquo;s areas of strength, you can start to pick classes that amplify what (your) god gave you.</span></li></ul><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c48"><span class="c28">Although Barbarians don&rsquo;t make for effective Inquisitor gestalts due to their restrictions on casting while raging, </span><span class="c19">Bloodragers</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;are another story entirely. With full BAB progression, a variety of self-buff spells and bloodline powers, and moar smash than you can shake a greatsword at, Bloodragers take the Inquisitor&rsquo;s wrecking-ball-burst-damage propensities and ratchet them all up to 11. The class nets you some much-needed combat feats, too</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c28">always a plus. Speaking of extra combat feats, well, there&rsquo;s always </span><span class="c19">Fighter.</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Armor Training is a boon for the squishier Inquisitor chassis, and you&rsquo;ll definitely appreciate Advanced Weapon Training. Even Bravery finds its niche on the Inquisitor, whose Judgments all shut down if they&rsquo;re ever subjected to a fear effect. Best of all, however, are those tasty, tasty feats, some of which are Fighter-only. Go TWF and be a Bane Blender, become a god of knowledge checks as a Lore Warden, or roleplay as Christian Bale from </span><span class="c6">Equilibrium</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;with a Black Powder Inquisition/Trench Fighter combo. With the Fighter&rsquo;s feats, the world&rsquo;s your oyster. If you&rsquo;re looking to be a little more adaptive and a little less reactive, the </span><span class="c19">Brawler</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;is worth taking a look at. Brawler&rsquo;s Flurry gets Bane stacked onto each hit, and there&rsquo;s no denying that Martial Flexibility rules the school if you&rsquo;ve got enough familiarity with the system and its many feat trees to take full advantage. I wish your spell list were better for touch debuffs, because being a close range Domain Strike debuffer with access to Style feats and genuinely good combat maneuvers sounds amazing. </span><span class="c19">Monk </span><span class="c28">can do some of what Brawlers can, of course, but where the Brawler can fill other niches, the Monk feels a bit more straitjacketed unless you&rsquo;re going for a specific archetype. With the advent of the Martial Arts Handbook and its new handwrap weapons, both the Brawler and the Monk are more viable as DEX-based classes. Just slap the </span><span class="c6">agile</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;enchantment on there and go to town.</span></p><p class="c7 c9 c48"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c7 c48"><span class="c28">Other full-BAB classes tend to fulfill more specific purposes: </span><span class="c19">Cavaliers</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;make for bad-ass mounted gestalt Inquisitors, unsurprisingly, and the Cavalier&rsquo;s Tactician ability combined with the Inquisitor&rsquo;s metric tonne of Teamwork feats can melt even brutally difficult encounters in a hurry. Melting enemies is also par for the </span><span class="c19">Gunslinger&rsquo;s</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;course; the Inquisitor&rsquo;s natural out-of-combat utility compensates for the Gunslinger&rsquo;s utter lack of the same, making it a strange but wonderful pairing. As always, </span><span class="c19">Ranger</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;can be an excellent choice in games where terrain and enemy types are more or less consistent, but </span><span class="c19">Slayer</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;is the safer bet, effortlessly boosting combat punch in nearly all scenarios. And if you really want to go off the rails? Hell, gestalt with a </span><span class="c19">Kineticist</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;to pick up either way more utility (think Aether, Air, etc.) or non-stop blasts (Earth) for when you get tired of going toe to toe with enemies. Absurdly high CON scores help Kineticists immensely, so think about races like Dwarf that conveniently boost both CON and WIS.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c7 c48"><span class="c28">If you don&rsquo;t feel like BAB is your primary concern, you can always look at other &frac34; BAB classes. </span><span class="c19">Hunter</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;again amps your Teamwork feat game up to 11, gives you a fully scaling animal companion and Animal Focus, and puts the Ranger and Druid spell lists in your hands. </span><span class="c19">Druids</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;are incredibly powerful, but you might need to choose between casting efficacy and combat efficacy. At any rate, highly thematic for Erastil, Gozreh, and other nature deities. </span><span class="c19">Shaman</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;can fill a similar role, giving you full casting, hexes, and a variety of powerful Spirit portfolios to play with; those seeking more traditional Domain-oriented options and equally powerful casting/channelling should apply inside with the </span><span class="c19">Cleric.</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;I know that the </span><span class="c19">Unchained Rogue</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c19">Vigilante</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;are cousin classes at best, and that Vigilante has much to offer on its own, but I&rsquo;ll mention them in the same breath here to say that they both add immense combat and out-of-combat utility to the Inquisitor, especially in intrigue campaigns like </span><span class="c6">War for the Crown</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;or </span><span class="c6">Curse of the Crimson Throne.</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Will you be better at hitting things? No. But </span><span class="c6">man,</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;will those hits hurt. Self-buffs, Judgment, Bane, </span><span>sneak attack</span><span class="c28">, Debilitating Injury...ludicrous. Last but not least, I&rsquo;ll mention that the </span><span class="c19">Warpriest</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;is for those who truly want to knock down legions of bodies with the power of their faith. Say goodbye to your swift actions.

We have trip bonuses from Improved Trip, Dirty Fighting, Tandem Trip, Felling Smash, and the advanced unlock of Torag&rsquo;s Patient Strikes, which grants a free action trip attempt on successful crit confirmation. Functionally unlimited AoOs from the base Divine Fighting Technique hit their stride with Paired Opportunists and the advanced DFT ability to apply Vital Strike to AoOs. Finally, our flanking is </span><span class="c6">incredible.</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Pack Tactics grants our WIS bonus to hit when flanking conventionally (a huge boost that far outstrips even Outflank) or we can designate squares to &ldquo;flank&rdquo; from if conventional flanking is difficult; Swarm Strike adds yet more accuracy, while Precise Strike is a good bit of damage.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c28">The template for most combats will be to move ourselves and our companion into flanking position with the biggest baddie we can find, trusting heavy armor and </span><span class="c6">hedging weapons</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;to provide some defensive cover in early levels while we go to work. </span><span class="c6">Clay skin, deadly juggernaut,</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;and the </span><span class="c6">magic circle</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;spells will be our go-to defenses in later levels.

If you don&rsquo;t need Improved Critical, I&rsquo;d suggest you pick up the Spontaneous Nature&rsquo;s Ally feat for easy battlefield summoning or the Planar Focus feat for more versatile foci for you and your companion.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="c18" id="h.2dzv2hv9uokr"><span class="c24 c58">The Ascetic</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c24 c38 c51">LG Oread Zen Archer Monk 3 + Ravener Hunter Inquisitor 12</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c24 c19">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">Deity:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Erastil, </span><span class="c19">Mystery:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Stone</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">STR:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;12 (+2) &nbsp;</span><span class="c19">DEX:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;13 &nbsp;</span><span class="c19">CON:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;14 &nbsp;</span><span class="c19">INT:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;8 &nbsp;</span><span class="c19">WIS:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;17 (+2) &nbsp;</span><span class="c19">CHA:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;9 (-2)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">Primary Weapon:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Composite Longbow</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">Racial Traits:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Crystalline Form, Granite Skin</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">Traits:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Deadeye Bowman (Religion), Storm Hunter (Regional)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">Favored Class Bonuses:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Skill Point 1 -

Zen Archer has had a reputation as being brokenly, stupidly overpowered since Day 1, and the Inquisitor can do some brokenly, stupidly overpowered things with it, mainly by getting a </span><span class="c6">bunch</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;of very necessary feat taxes dumped into the build within the first few levels. Thematically, I like the idea of a rustic Oread living in harmony with the land, connecting with small communities around him yet always living one step removed. At 4th level, the local settlement is terrorized by a swarm of Vrock, and he&rsquo;s forced to take on the mantle of an Inquisitor, striking the Abyss-spawn from the sky with divine magics and volleys of arrows. As he ventures out into the world, older and wiser, he takes with him revelations from his Oread ancestry, manifested as the Stone Mystery.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ascetic build doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of tricks up its sleeves, but it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily need them. You get &ldquo;all&rdquo; the necessary early-level ranged feats by 3rd level, including the excellent Point-Blank Master, which allows you to stand in the middle of a crowd and fire off arrow after arrow like Robin Hood crossed with a Howitzer. This isn&rsquo;t to say that the shift into Inquisitor is painless, however. Our flurry starts to fall behind quickly, for example, leaving us to rely on Rapid Shot and Manyshot more than a full Zen Archer would. Likewise, the AC bonus from WIS stops cutting it more and more of the time as we progress, so we switch to medium armor immediately after getting our proficiency from Inquisitor; the movement speed is nice, but armor ultimately gives us better AC in the absence of the Monk&rsquo;s scaling bonuses. One last fly in the ointment: our Oread combines two &frac34; BAB classes that together delay entry into some of the +6 and +11 BAB feats. If your GM is cool with you taking Zen Archer as an Unchained Monk archetype, that wraps that problem up with a neat little bow. If not, well, this build is probably stretching their patience as it is. We do add in some small utility with Ranged Trip, although the feat is really only there to 1) take up space while we wait for +6 BAB, and 2) capitalize on Stone Stability&rsquo;s free Improved/Greater Trip feats. Ace Trip is unfortunately not open to anyone but Fighters thanks to the Weapon Training prereq. Womp womp. As you move into Inquisitor, do be sure to grab the Bane Baldric, as it will replenish your Bane rounds to normal single-class Inquisitor levels. You&rsquo;ll want those.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="c18" id="h.8s9k69zaswzx"><span class="c24 c58">The Blade Savant</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c24 c38 c51">NG Human Ravener Hunter/Sanctified Slayer 15</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Deity:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Sarenrae, </span><span class="c19">Mystery:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Battle</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">STR: </span><span class="c28">10 &nbsp;</span><span class="c19">DEX: </span><span class="c28">16 (+2) </span><span class="c19">&nbsp;CON: </span><span class="c28">14 &nbsp;</span><span class="c19">INT:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;8 &nbsp;</span><span class="c19">WIS: </span><span class="c28">15 &nbsp;</span><span class="c19">CHA:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;10</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Primary Weapon:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Scimitar</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Racial Traits:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;N/A</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Traits:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Careful Combatant (Combat), Flame of the Dawnflower (Religion)</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">Favored Class Bonuses:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;HP 1 - 3, Additional Spells Known 4 - 20</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c24 c19">Abilities</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">1:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Stern Gaze, Monster Lore, </span><span>studied target</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;+1 (SS), Charged By Nature (RH), Holy Magic (RH), Weapon Mastery (Battle Mystery)</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">2:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Track, Detect Alignment, Cunning Initiative</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">3:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Demon Hunter (RH)</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">4:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Sneak </span><span>a</span><span class="c12">ttack +1d6</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">5:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Discern Lies, Bane, </span><span>studied target</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;+2 (SS)</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">6:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Solo Tactics</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">7:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Sneak </span><span>a</span><span class="c12">ttack +2d6</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">8:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Slayer Talent (Ranger Combat Style: Menacing), War Sight (Battle Mystery)</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c24 c19">9:</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">10: </span><span class="c28">Sneak </span><span>a</span><span class="c28">ttack +3d6, </span><span>studied target</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;+3 (SS)</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">11:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Stalwart</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">12:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Greater Bane</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">13:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Sneak </span><span>a</span><span class="c12">ttack + 4d6</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">14:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Exploit Weakness</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">15:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Studied </span><span>t</span><span class="c12">arget +4 (SS)</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c24 c19">Feats</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">1:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Weapon Finesse, Divine Fighting Technique (Sarenrae&rsquo;s Mercy, Human Bonus), Weapon Focus: Scimitar (Battle Mystery Bonus)</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c24 c19">2:</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">3:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Dervish Dance, Demon Hunter (RH Bonus)</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c24 c19">4:</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">5:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Enforcer</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">6:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Precise Strike (Teamwork)</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">7:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Signature Skill: Intimidate</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c19">8:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Shatter Defenses (Menacing Ranger Combat Style Bonus;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the Cult of the Dawnflower, the Blade Savant learned the way of the scimitar at a young age, raised within the Mwangi Expanse during the Cult&rsquo;s long period of exile and disfavor in Osirion. Although she recognizes that mercy is the ultimate gift of the Dawnflower, she also knows that only by rendering enemies helpless as swiftly as possible can they be prevented from harming others. To that end the Blade Savant build focuses heavily on nonlethal damage, with intimidation skills helping end combats before they begin or leaving enemies unable to muster effective defenses. Thankfully, the many bonus feats from both Sanctified Slayer and the Ravener Hunter&rsquo;s Battle Mystery allow us to achieve levels of martial prowess normally unattainable by other Inquisitors.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c28">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our initial levels are typical of Finesse builds: Finesse at 1st level, and DEX-to-damage by 3rd. Our Divine Fighting Technique, Sarenrae&rsquo;s Mercy, doesn&rsquo;t come into its own until 5th level, when Enforcer allows our nonlethal scimitar damage to demoralize on every hit. From that point on, the Intimidation train rolls through all obstacles. Signature Skill: Intimidate nets us the ability to escalate fear conditions quickly, and Shatter Defenses, which follows at 8th level, enables nonlethal </span><span>sneak attack</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;against every shaken enemy. The Battle Mystery also ups our crit range at 8th level to a whopping 15-20/x2. With a brief detour to pick up the prerequisite Great Fortitude, we suddenly have the ability at 10th level to heal ourselves for 2d6 damage, once per round</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c28">enormous for staying power in more protracted fights. Dazzling Display tops off our build with some crowd control, but we&rsquo;re basically complete by 10th level. Per scimitar hit at 13th level, we&rsquo;re dealing 1d6 (weapon damage) + 2d6 (</span><span class="c6">merciful sapping</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;scimitar) + 1d6 (Precise Strike) + 4d6 (</span><span>greater bane</span><span class="c28">) + 4d6 (</span><span>sneak attack</span><span class="c28">), healing 2d6 damage, and demoralizing as a free action; our crit range is 15-20/x2, we have Weapon Focus/Greater Weapon Focus/</span><span>studied target</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;bonuses, and best of all, we&rsquo;re rolling three times for initiative on a DEX- and WIS-based class with Cunning Initiative. Even against enemies with immunity to nonlethal damage, our build isn&rsquo;t hamstrung too much</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c28">we take away the 2d6 </span><span class="c6">merciful sapping</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;bonus, 2d6 damage healed, and Enforcer demoralizations, but otherwise we&rsquo;re clean.

Our halfie was raised in the Hold of Belkzen, like so many of his full-blooded Orc kin, but the life of a bastard is not easy there: half-orcs must prove themselves either more vicious or more cunning than full orcs, and where possible, they should prove themselves to be both. When it became clear to him that the orc tribes of Belkzen had no higher goal than infighting and clan warfare, he took a contract with the infamous Children of Steel mercenary company, which allowed him to exercise his considerable talents for violence and terror. The more he slaughters in the open field, the more ferocious Gorum&rsquo;s smile grows.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c28">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As &nbsp;I mentioned in the two-handed combat style section, decent armor and Power Attack are all that STR Inquisitors really need to smash face. Because half-orcs also have considerable advantages in intimidation builds, however, we&rsquo;ve also capitalized on our in-born abilities in that arena. Taking into account our initial bonuses (Racial +2, Trait +2, Stern Gaze +&frac12;, FCB +&frac12;, Rank +1, Class Skill +3, CHA +1) we begin play with +10 to Intimidate</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">not at all shabby. 5th through 7th levels prove crucial stages for our Intimidation skill, giving us DD at 5th, Pack Intimidation (an easy untyped +6 to Intimidate) at 6th, and free action single-target demoralization with Cornugon Smash at 7th. Scarred Legion gives another +2, and pairs nicely with Hurtful, which gives swift action attacks for more Bane damage. Signature Skill: Intimidate represents another jump in effectiveness, as we begin moving enemies straight into frightened or panicked. Furious Focus is decent enough at 13th, but mostly sets us up for Dreadful Carnage at 15th. Every kill is another Dazzling Display, and the Memorable trait helps us keep those fear conditions running throughout an encounter.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c28">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the Battle Mystery needs no help in keeping us combat-effective. Weapon Focus, Greater Weapon Focus, and particularly Improved Critical are excellent adjuncts to the greatsword, which is an OP weapon without any help at all. We can and should be placing enchantments like </span><span class="c6">cruel, dazzling radiance, exhausting,</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c6">gory</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;on our greatsword to ensure maximum demoralization debuffing. At 8th level we also become decent Overrun specialists, using class level for our BAB and grabbing Improved Overrun for free. With Greater Overrun at 11th and especially Coordinated Charge at 15th level, enemies will be taking AoOs if they&rsquo;re ever knocked prone by our combat maneuver, which we like just fine. War Sight can be subbed for Maneuver Mastery if you don</span><span>&rsquo;t like that playstyle. </span><span class="c12">Overall, the Brute does scary damage, area debuffing via demoralization tactics, and self-buffing (strictly self, due to our low WIS score) to hopefully increase size and CMB for Overruns.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="c18" id="h.v3xqfabary30"><span class="c24 c58">The Magehunter</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c24 c38 c51">LG Dwarf Spellbreaker Inquisitor 15</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">Deity:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Torag, </span><span class="c19">Inquisition:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Spellkiller</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">STR: </span><span class="c28">16 &nbsp;</span><span class="c19">DEX:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;12 </span><span class="c19">&nbsp;CON: </span><span class="c28">13 (+2) </span><span class="c19">&nbsp;INT:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;10 &nbsp;</span><span class="c19">WIS: </span><span class="c28">14 (+2) &nbsp;</span><span class="c19">CHA: </span><span class="c12">10 (-2)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">Primary Weapon:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Warhammer</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">Racial Traits: </span><span class="c12">Spell Smasher</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">Traits: </span><span class="c12">Sound of Mind (Regional), Defensive Strategist (Religion)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">Favored Class Bonuses: </span><span class="c12">HP 1 - 20</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c24 c19">Abilities</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">1:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Judgment 1/day, Stern Gaze, Strong-Willed (SB)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">2:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Track, Detect Alignment, Cunning Initiative</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">3:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Defense Against Magic: Enchantment +1 (SB), Foil Casting (SB)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">4:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Judgment 2/day</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">5:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Discern Lies, Bane</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19 c24">6:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">7:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Judgment 3/day, Defense Against Magic: Necromancy +1, Enchantment +2 (SB)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">8:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Second Judgment</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c24 c19">9:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">10:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Judgment 4/day</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">11:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Stalwart, Defense Against Magic: Evocation +1, Necromancy +2, Enchantment +3 (SB)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">12:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Greater Bane</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">13:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Judgment 5/day</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">14:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Exploit Weakness</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">15:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Defense Against Magic: Conjuration +1, Evocation +2, Necromancy +3, Enchantment +4 (SB)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c24 c19">Feats</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">1:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Heavy Armor Proficiency, Disruptive (Spellkiller Inquisition Bonus)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c24 c19">2:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">3:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Power Attack</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c24 c19">4:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">5:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Step Up</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c24 c19">6:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">7:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Following Step</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c24 c19">8:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">9:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Iron Will</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c24 c19">10:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">11:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Spellbreaker (if allowed by GM), Spell Drinker (if not)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c24 c19">12:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">13:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Teleport Tactician (if allowed by GM), Unimpeachable Honor (if not)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c24 c19">14:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">15:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Step Up and Strike</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c24 c19">Strategy</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c28">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of the Magehunter build is determined in some part by how lenient your GM is willing to be about counting Spellbreaker Inquisitor levels as Fighter levels for the purposes of qualifying specifically for anti-magic feats. At my table I would allow an Inquisitor to take Spellbreaker and Teleport Tactician &nbsp;if magehunting were their sole focus, but your dynamic might vary. There are some who say I&rsquo;m soft. Assuming we&rsquo;re lacking Spellbreaker, that crucial alchemical element in an anti-caster build, all we&rsquo;re empowered to do is stay within threatening range, follow where they step, and keep hammering them while tanking their defensive casting. Certainly the Magehunter&rsquo;s defensive abilities will always be greater than any Fighter&rsquo;s: we&rsquo;ve got Hardy for an initial +2 to Will, rerolls on [mind-affecting] spells, Sound of Mind, Iron Will later on, </span><span>stalwart</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;shutting down spells with partial saves, and Defense Against Magic&rsquo;s scaling bonuses vs. some of the most dangerous magic schools in the game.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Lawful Evil Tiefling must worship Asmodeus, right? That&rsquo;s exactly what she&rsquo;d like you to think. Growing up as the child of a minor noble, the tangled intrigues of Ustalav always seemed to come naturally to the Mastermind. She just...knew things, things that she never should have been able to know. It was only later that her powers were revealed to be a divine gift from the Reaper of Reputation. She set about extending her influence throughout the nobility of her nation, hoarding secrets and finding leverage wherever necessary. Mechanically, her immense power in an intrigue-heavy game stems from several sources. First, she has an insane Bluff score (Cunning Liar lets us use WIS for a +4 at 1st level, Racial Trait +4, Gifted Detective +4, Deific Obedience +3, and later constant </span><span class="c6">nondetection</span><span class="c28">) with Disguise and Diplomacy bonuses to back up our web of deception. A Thousand Faces at 12th level gives us at-will </span><span class="c6">alter self</span><span class="c28">. Second, she gets a slew of detection and illicit knowledge-gathering spells, including constant </span><span class="c6">deathwatch</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;(Soul Seer racial trait); at-will </span><span class="c6">detect undead, detect aberration, detect secret doors</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;(Royal Accuser); and </span><span class="c6">detect thoughts, detect desires, </span><span class="c28">and</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;detect anxieties</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;as often as you can devote the spell slot. Lastly, Meticulous Inspection, Informed Hunch, and a good favored class bonus will ensure that she can make lateral leaps of logic to discern seemingly unknowable details about her targets.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c28">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a combat perspective, our Mastermind has a bit of a slow build. Strong WIS scores to start and the bevy of Divination spells lends itself to a casting focus, so we grab Conceal Spell/Improved at later levels in order to hide our unsanctioned detections better; Divine Deception patches any holes in our spell coverage with scrolls and wands. Cunning Killer leverages good Knowledges from our FCB, and with any luck we&rsquo;ll be able to utilize those Favored Enemy bonuses at some point. Norgorber&rsquo;s boons are surprisingly strong, too, including more Divination SLAs that we&rsquo;ll always find a use for, poison (it&rsquo;s meh overall, but at least you improve the action economy and no longer poison yourself), and best of all get a </span><span class="c6">minutes/day</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;version of </span><span class="c6">greater invisibility,</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;which is already incredibly strong at rounds/level.

Darkness hides friends as well as foes; anyone who ventures into this Grippli&rsquo;s home with ill intent will soon find out just how much vengeance hurts. The purpose of this build is to deny enemies any opportunity to see the Vigilante coming, and he gets off to a strong start: between his various bonuses (DEX +4, Size +4, Class Skill +3, Trait +1, Swift and Silent +1, Skill Focus: Stealth +3, Ranks +3) he arrives at 3rd level with a tidy +19; if he&rsquo;s allowed to take Heretic on top of this package (there are some minor shenanigans with Judgment) he&rsquo;ll be getting our WIS modifier to Stealth, as well, for a potential +22. Dampen Presence and Hellcat Stealth (lacking HiPS really stinks, although this build can easily dip Shadowdancer to fix that) will continue to assure his stealth supremacy throughout most of the game.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c28">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for offense, the Vigilante focuses on being as elusive as possible, blinding big bads with magical darkness (darkness that he can see through quite fine, naturally, thanks to Eyes of Darkness at 9th level) before stinging in with </span><span>studied target</span><span class="c28">, </span><span>sneak attack</span><span class="c28">, and Bane. 8th and 9th level give a means of contributing to the team&rsquo;s effectiveness by permanently carving away natural armor. He&rsquo;s incredibly difficult to pin down, using Escape Route and an excellent Acrobatics score to weave through crowded battlefields and reach priority targets easily. His natural Climb speed lends a vertical element to stealth and ambush.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she doesn&rsquo;t look it, Lamashtu is actually a fertility goddess, a point of theology that this Inquisitor has not forgotten. There are many who would wantonly slay the Mother of Monsters&rsquo; children, so the Witch takes it as her personal goal to vomit more out into the world as often as possible. The build itself is fairly simple: fill the field with powerful summons, then take potshots with the crossbow or provide backup buffing through spells. Our first pick, Summon Evil Monster, is important for two reasons: first, it vastly improves the summoning options we have available; and second, it allows us to summon evil creatures as a </span><span class="c6">standard action.</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;That&rsquo;s right. With our already-excellent DEX and WIS scores, plus Improved Initiative at 3rd level, we should consistently be going first, either summoning with our standard action in the surprise round or else ASAP in the first round of combat. Properly placed, our summons can take AoOs as enemies attempt to close with the party, or even provide soft cover in order to let allies safely escape enemies with reach. In later levels, our summons will stick around long enough to support the party with an excellent variety of SLAs. The home stretch simply boosts the power curve, with Augment, Evolved, Superior, and Versatile buffing our summons exponentially. Teamwork feats stay low-maintenance: all summons get Outflank, and the rest are for shoring up our casting and defenses on the back line. Stealth Synergy at very late levels lets us sneak with our stealthier summons.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="c18" id="h.k27iv96e66zq"><span class="c24 c58">The Wizard-Shield</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c24 c38 c51">NG Peri-Blooded Aasimar Living Grimoire/Tactical Leader 15</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">Deity:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Shelyn, </span><span class="c19">Domain: </span><span class="c28">Luck, </span><span class="c19">Subdomain: </span><span class="c12">Imagination</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">STR:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;15 &nbsp;</span><span class="c19">DEX:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;14 &nbsp;</span><span class="c19">CON: </span><span class="c28">12 </span><span class="c19">&nbsp;INT: </span><span class="c28">16 (+2) &nbsp;</span><span class="c19">WIS: </span><span class="c28">10 &nbsp;</span><span class="c19">CHA: </span><span class="c12">7 (+2)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">Primary Weapon: </span><span class="c12">Holy Book</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">Racial Traits:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Deathless Spirit, Scion of Humanity</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">Traits:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Student of Philosophy (Diplomacy) (Social), Pragmatic Activator (Magic)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">Favored Class Bonuses: </span><span class="c12">HP 1 - 20</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c24 c19">Abilities</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">1:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Holy Book (LG), Sacred Word (LG), Leader&rsquo;s Words (TL), Bit of Luck (Luck Domain)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">2:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Track, Detect Alignment</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">3:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Tactician (TL)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c24 c19">4:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">5:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Discern Lies, Blessed Script (2nd Level, LG: </span><span class="c6">litany of duty, silence</span><span class="c12">)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">6:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Haze of Daydreams (Imagination Subdomain)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c24 c19">7:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">8:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Blessed Script (3rd Level, LG: </span><span class="c6">magic circle vs. evil, dispel magic, shield of darkness</span><span class="c12">)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c24 c19">9:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c24 c19">10:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">11:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Stalwart</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">12:</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;Blessed Script (4th Level, LG: </span><span class="c6">enchantment foil, freedom of movement, thaumaturgic circle</span><span class="c12">)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c24 c19">13:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">14:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Battle Acumen (TL)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c24 c19">15:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c24 c19">Feats</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">1:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Improved Initiative</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c24 c19">2:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">3:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Warrior Priest, Shielded Caster (Teamwork)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c24 c19">4:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">5:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Divine Deception</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c24 c19">6:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">7:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Power Attack</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c24 c19">8:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">9:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Steadfast Mind, Allied Caster (Teamwork)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c24 c19">10:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">11:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Divine Interference</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c24 c19">12:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">13:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Combat Casting</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c24 c19">14:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c19">15:</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;Uncanny Concentration</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c24 c19">Strategy</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c51">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c28">Ever the devotee of Shelyn, our Wizard-Shield Inquisitor illuminates her own copy of </span><span class="c6">Melodies of Inner Beauty,</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;lavishing attention on the descriptions of innocence and virtue contained therein. She knows that there is more beauty in one saved life than in a thousand lost lives, even the lives of foes, and so she focuses absolutely on the defense of the full casters who comprise the back line of any adventuring group. Because caster level checks and spell save DCs will never be her mechanical forte (Forte? Goddess of Music? Get it?) she instead opts to expand her spell options and ensure that she never, ever fails to cast in moments of dire hazard to life and limb. Right from 1st level, Bit of Luck sets her up to help her Wizard and Sorcerer buddies by letting them roll twice on ranged spell attacks, caster level checks to beat SR, saves against devastating Fortitude effects, and other things that shut casters down quickly. Her Tactician ability lets her select Shielded Caster at 3rd level to prevent the back line from faltering should they get charged, and select Allied Caster at 9th level for when offense is the name of the game</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c12">just in time for SR to become prevalent, too. In later levels, she can use Divine Interference to tear down powerful, one-off hits from enemies who rampage into the rearguard.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c28">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Wizard-Shield is bolstering her allies, she&rsquo;s also shoring up her ability to hold the back line all on her own. Warrior Priest, Combat Casting, Uncanny Concentration, and Steadfast Mind together make it nearly impossible for her to lose a spell when casting defensively, and Divine Deception paired with the Pragmatic Activator trait make her a pocket-Cleric or pocket-Paladin, always ready with a scroll or wand</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c28">even Druid spell completion items aren&rsquo;t out of the realm of possibility. Haze of Daydreams shields her from approaching hostiles, pending a Will save. Should anyone get swallowed or grappled, she naturally has </span><span class="c6">freedom of movement</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;on tap in her 4th-level Blessed Script SLA slot</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c28">equally naturally, she flavors her tattoos as an expression of inner creativity. Lastly, there&rsquo;s our Wizard-Shield&rsquo;s offense, which we haven&rsquo;t even touched on! Power Attack with a not-inconsiderable 16 STR hits pretty hard, especially once her self-illuminated </span><span class="c6">Melodies</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;gets </span><span class="c6">bane</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;and other fun Warpriest goodies stacked onto it. Decent DEX/CON and medium armor make her more than capable of soaking stray hits. </span><span class="c6">She dwells with beauty, beauty that must die...</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h1 class="c71 c27" id="h.ewvs0lk9i8tg"><span class="c24 c75 c35"></span></h1><h1 class="c71" id="h.r1vmdp7x24wt"><span class="c24 c75 c35">INQ900: Graduation and Back Matter</span></h1><p class="c2"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c28">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so our journey concludes, bold Inquisitors.

Still to accomplish for this guide are more wondrous item recommendations for Inquisitors, compatibility between archetypes for those selecting two or more, and the completion of the Dips, VMC, Prestige, and Gestalt section, which is a considerable undertaking.
